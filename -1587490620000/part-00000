The university's departments represent the traditional studies in arts, commerce, sciences and engineering through programs such as [[English studies|English]],History, [[Languages]] and [[Linguistics]], Economics, [[Business Studies]], [[Mathematics]], [[Applied Mathematics]] (est.2002), [[Physics]], [[Computer Science & Engineering]], [[Chemistry]], Statistics, Geology & Mining, [[Geography]], [[Psychology]], [[Zoology]], [[Botany]], etc. The university is increasingly emphasising more specialised programs such as [[Pharmacy]], [[Biochemistry]], [[Information engineering (field)|Information]] and [[Communication Engineering]] (ICE) (est. 2000), [[Genetics]] and [[Breeding in the wild|breeding]] (est. 1996).<ref name=\"profile\"/>\n\n===Faculty of Life and Earth Science===\nProminent departments in the faculty of [[Life Sciences|Life]] and [[Earth Sciences]] are\n\n# Geography and Environmental Studies\n# [[Psychology]]\n# [[Botany]]\n# [[Zoology]]\n# Geology & Mining\n# Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology\n# [[Clinical Psychology]]\n\n===Faculty of Arts===\nProminent departments in the faculty of [[Arts]] are\n\n#Department of English\n#Department of Bangla\n#Department of History\n#Department of Islamic History and Culture\n# Islamic Studies\n# Arabic\n# [[Sanskrit]]\n# Urdu\n# Persian Language and Literature\n\n===Faculty of Law===\nThe Faculty of Law has the following departments:\n# Department of Law, University of Rajshahi\n# Department of Law and Land Administration\n\nThe Department of Law is one of the pioneer institutes for graduate level legal education in Bangladesh as well as in South Asia. It was the first institution in South Asia that offered B.Jur. Honours (Bachelor of Jurisprudence). Now it offers LLB (Honours), LLM, Evening LLM, MPhil and PhD in the field of Law. It has a great number of alumni around the world including former president, chief justice, ministers and many of former and current judges of the apex courts of Bangladesh. This is one of the most demandable choice for the High school/college students of Bangladesh.\n\nThe Department of Law and Land Administration was established in the session of 2015-16. It is the pioneer department in Bangladesh as well as in the world in the field of education on Laws relating to land administration, land management and land survey. All core courses of Law are taught here. Graduates of this discipline can apply for all jobs which are for Law graduates, including the positions of Assistant Judge and Judicial Magistrate. They are able to practise as both civil and criminal lawyers and also as Income Tax lawyers. In addition, they are able to apply for jobs in the field of land administration/management. It is currently under a consideration that a separate BCS Cadre (Land) may be created and graduates from this discipline will only be able to apply for those jobs. The programmes offered by this Department include LLB (Honours), LLM, MPhil and PhD.\n \nThese two departments operate through a separate faculty - the Faculty of Law. Initiatives are under process  to establish a new department on the field of Corporate law under this faculty which is going to be the first institution for graduate level education in this field within Bangladesh.\n\nThis faculty is well known for the innovative environment on its premises. A huge library facility is provided here for the students and researchers. This institution provides a great chance to work with some of the greatest legal scholars of this country. The Bangladesh code was developed and was given a great shape for practical use under the leadership of a former chairman of this department in 2006.\n\nStudents of this institution are also popular for their extra-curricular activities. One of the leading debating clubs of the campus belongs to this department. Having a great tradition of mooting, and some nationally popular great legal practitioners as alumni, its Mooting Club RUMCS is well recognised and reputed in Bangladesh.\n\n===Faculty of Engineering===\nThe Faculty of Engineering include the following departments\n# [[Information engineering (field)|Information]] and Communication Engineering (ICE) (est. 2000)\n# Computer Science & Engineering\n# [[Applied Chemistry]] & [[Chemical Engineering]]\n# Materials Science and Engineering\n# Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) (est. 2015)\n\nIn the late 1990 and 2000s, programs in computer science & engineering and Information & Communication Engineering were introduced. The newest addition to the Faculty of Engineering is the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2015. The university used to have a separate engineering program through BIT (Bangladesh Institute of Technology) Rajshahi, which has become an independent university: [[Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology]] in 2002. University authorities have decided to merge Applied physics and electronic engineering department with electrical and electronic engineering department on 5 December 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newagebd.net/article/58197/ru-to-merge-apee-eee-depts|title=RU to merge APEE, EEE depts|date=2018-12-07 |accessdate=2019-06-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://somoynews.tv/pages/details/%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%9A%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9B%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%87-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%97|title=\u09b0\u09be\u09ac\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7 \u098f\u0995\u09c0\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09b9\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c1\u0987 \u09ac\u09bf\u09ad\u09be\u0997\n|date=2018-12-06 |accessdate=2019-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Faculty of Social Science===\n\nThe Social Science Faculty has the following departments:\n\n# Economics\n# Political Science\n# Social Work\n# Sociology\n# Mass Communication and Journalism\n# Information Science & Library Management\n# Public Administration\n# Anthropology\n# Folklore\n# International Relations<ref name=\"deptinfo\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.ru.ac.bd/?page_id=722\n | title = Departments of University of Rajshahi\n | publisher = University of Rajshahi\n | accessdate = 14 July 2006\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Faculty of Business Studies ===\nFaculty of Business Studies has following departments:\n\n# [[Finance]]\n# Accounting & Information Systems\n# [[Marketing]]\n# [[Management Studies]]\n# Banking & Insurance\n# Tourism & Hospitality Management\n\nAll of these departments are in the Rabindra Building.\n\n===Faculty of Science===\nFaculty of Science has the following departments:\n\n# Mathematics\n# Physics\n# Chemistry\n# Statistics\n# Biochemistry & Molecular Biology\n# Pharmacy\n# [[Department of Population Science and Human Resource Development|Population Science & Human Resource Development]]\n# Applied Mathematics\n# Physical Education and Sports Sciences\n\nMost of these departments are in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th science buildings.\n\n===Faculty of Agriculture===\n\nFaculty of Agriculture has the following departments:\n\n# Agronomy and Agricultural Extension\n# Crop Science and Technology was established in 2005.

Medical education is provided by seven medical colleges located around Rajshahi Division and Khulna Division. Though these colleges are autonomous to a large extent, the degrees are conferred by Rajshahi University. [[Rajshahi Medical College]] is the oldest medical college under administration of the university and is a few miles west of the university campus along with the highly equipped 1000-bed [[Rajshahi Medical College Hospital]].\n\nGovernment medical colleges under the supervision of Rajshahi University:\n\n# [[Rajshahi Medical College]]\n# [[Pabna Medical College]]\n# [[Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College]]\n# [[Rangpur Medical College]]\n# [[Dinajpur Medical College]]\n# [[Kushtia Medical College]]\n# [[Jessore Medical College]]\n# [[Khulna Medical College]]\n# [[Satkhira Medical College]]\n# Shaheed M.

The halls are named after prominent Bangladeshi historical and cultural figures, some of them from Rajshahi. The largest men's hall is Shahid Habibur Rahman Hall, named after a mathematics professor killed on campus during the 1971 war by the Pakistani Army. The largest women's hall is Monnujan Hall, followed by Begum Rokeya Hall, named after [[Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain]], a leading figure in women's rights activism in Bengal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe housing system can accommodate  more than 10,000 students, which has created a deepening accommodation crisis as the student body has risen to 25,000.<ref name=\"BDToday\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ru.ac.bd/administration/paper.htm|title=University of Rajshahi |accessdate=29 April 2008 |author=  |date=5 August 2005 |year= |work=Glorious 52 years |publisher=The Bangladesh Today   |pages= }}</ref> Apart from the seat limitations, the amenities of these halls do not always meet decent accommodation standards.<ref name=\"amen_1\">{{cite news\n| author = S.M.

It was the first institution in South Asia that offered B.Jur. Honours (Bachelor of Jurisprudence). Now it offers LLB (Honours), LLM, Evening LLM, MPhil and PhD in the field of Law. It has a great number of alumni around the world including former president, chief justice, ministers and many of former and current judges of the apex courts of Bangladesh. This is one of the most demandable choice for the High school/college students of Bangladesh.\n\nThe Department of Law and Land Administration was established in the session of 2015-16. It is the pioneer department in Bangladesh as well as in the world in the field of education on Laws relating to land administration, land management and land survey. All core courses of Law are taught here. Graduates of this discipline can apply for all jobs which are for Law graduates, including the positions of Assistant Judge and Judicial Magistrate. They are able to practise as both civil and criminal lawyers and also as Income Tax lawyers. In addition, they are able to apply for jobs in the field of land administration/management. It is currently under a consideration that a separate BCS Cadre (Land) may be created and graduates from this discipline will only be able to apply for those jobs. The programmes offered by this Department include LLB (Honours), LLM, MPhil and PhD.\n \nThese two departments operate through a separate faculty - the Faculty of Law. Initiatives are under process  to establish a new department on the field of Corporate law under this faculty which is going to be the first institution for graduate level education in this field within Bangladesh.\n\nThis faculty is well known for the innovative environment on its premises. A huge library facility is provided here for the students and researchers. This institution provides a great chance to work with some of the greatest legal scholars of this country. The Bangladesh code was developed and was given a great shape for practical use under the leadership of a former chairman of this department in 2006.\n\nStudents of this institution are also popular for their extra-curricular activities. One of the leading debating clubs of the campus belongs to this department. Having a great tradition of mooting, and some nationally popular great legal practitioners as alumni, its Mooting Club RUMCS is well recognised and reputed in Bangladesh.\n\n===Faculty of Engineering===\nThe Faculty of Engineering include the following departments\n# [[Information engineering (field)|Information]] and Communication Engineering (ICE) (est. 2000)\n# Computer Science & Engineering\n# [[Applied Chemistry]] & [[Chemical Engineering]]\n# Materials Science and Engineering\n# Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) (est. 2015)\n\nIn the late 1990 and 2000s, programs in computer science & engineering and Information & Communication Engineering were introduced. The newest addition to the Faculty of Engineering is the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in 2015. The university used to have a separate engineering program through BIT (Bangladesh Institute of Technology) Rajshahi, which has become an independent university: [[Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology]] in 2002. University authorities have decided to merge Applied physics and electronic engineering department with electrical and electronic engineering department on 5 December 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newagebd.net/article/58197/ru-to-merge-apee-eee-depts|title=RU to merge APEE, EEE depts|date=2018-12-07 |accessdate=2019-06-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://somoynews.tv/pages/details/%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%9A%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9B%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%87-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%97|title=\u09b0\u09be\u09ac\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7 \u098f\u0995\u09c0\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09b9\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c1\u0987 \u09ac\u09bf\u09ad\u09be\u0997\n|date=2018-12-06 |accessdate=2019-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Faculty of Social Science===\n\nThe Social Science Faculty has the following departments:\n\n# Economics\n# Political Science\n# Social Work\n# Sociology\n# Mass Communication and Journalism\n# Information Science & Library Management\n# Public Administration\n# Anthropology\n# Folklore\n# International Relations<ref name=\"deptinfo\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.ru.ac.bd/?page_id=722\n | title = Departments of University of Rajshahi\n | publisher = University of Rajshahi\n | accessdate = 14 July 2006\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Faculty of Business Studies ===\nFaculty of Business Studies has following departments:\n\n# [[Finance]]\n# Accounting & Information Systems\n# [[Marketing]]\n# [[Management Studies]]\n# Banking & Insurance\n# Tourism & Hospitality Management\n\nAll of these departments are in the Rabindra Building.\n\n===Faculty of Science===\nFaculty of Science has the following departments:\n\n# Mathematics\n# Physics\n# Chemistry\n# Statistics\n# Biochemistry & Molecular Biology\n# Pharmacy\n# [[Department of Population Science and Human Resource Development|Population Science & Human Resource Development]]\n# Applied Mathematics\n# Physical Education and Sports Sciences\n\nMost of these departments are in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th science buildings.\n\n===Faculty of Agriculture===\n\nFaculty of Agriculture has the following departments:\n\n# Agronomy and Agricultural Extension\n# Crop Science and Technology was established in 2005.

Venezuela estimates its recoverable oil at 267 billion barrels (42 billion m<sup>3</sup>).<ref name=\"Dusseault 2001\"/> This places Canada and Venezuela in the same league as Saudi Arabia, having the three [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|largest oil reserves in the world]].\n\n=== Major deposits ===\nThere are numerous deposits of oil sands in the world, but the biggest and most important are in [[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]], with lesser deposits in [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Russia]]. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined. Vast deposits of bitumen \u2013 over 350 billion cubic metres (2.2 trillion barrels) of [[oil in place]] \u2013 exist in the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. If only 30% of this oil could be extracted, it could supply the entire needs of [[North America]] for over 100 years at 2002 consumption levels.

The collision compressed the Alberta plains and [[Geology of the Rocky Mountains#Raising the Rockies|raised the Rockies]] above the plains, forming [[Canadian Rockies|mountain ranges]]. This mountain building process buried the [[sedimentary rock]] layers which underlie most of Alberta [[structural basin|to a great depth]], creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a [[sedimentary basin|giant pressure cooker]] effect that converted the [[kerogen]] in the deeply buried [[oil shale geology|organic-rich shales]] to light oil and natural gas.<ref name=\"Dusseault 2001\"/><ref name=\"Hein\">{{cite web |url = http://www.apega.ca/members/Presentations/2013/APEGA%20Geology%20of%20the%20Oil%20Sands.pdf |last = Hein |first = Fran |title = Geology of the Oil Sands |publisher = Association of Petroleum Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta |accessdate = 2014-06-04 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130507094947/http://www.apega.ca/members/Presentations/2013/APEGA%20Geology%20of%20the%20Oil%20Sands.pdf |archive-date = 7 May 2013 |url-status = dead}}</ref> These [[source rock]]s were similar to the American so-called [[oil shale]]s, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil.\n\nThis overthrusting also tilted the pre-[[Cretaceous]] sedimentary rock formations underlying most of the sub-surface of Alberta, [[Depression (geology)|depressing]] the rock formations in southwest Alberta up to {{convert|8|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep near the Rockies, but to zero depth in the northeast, where they pinched out against the [[igneous rock]]s of the [[Canadian Shield]], which outcrop on the surface. This tilting is not apparent on the surface because the resulting trench has been filled in by eroded material from the mountains. The light oil migrated up-dip through hydro-dynamic transport from the Rockies in the southwest toward the [[Canadian Shield]] in the northeast following a complex pre-Cretaceous [[unconformity]] that exists in the formations under Alberta. The total distance of oil migration southwest to northeast was about {{convert|500|to|700|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. At the shallow depths of sedimentary formations in the northeast, massive [[microbial biodegradation]] as the [[Petroleum seep|oil approached the surface]] caused the oil to become highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] and immobile. Almost all of the remaining oil is found in the far north of Alberta, in Middle Cretaceous (115 million-year old) [[Western Interior Seaway|sand-silt-shale deposits]] overlain by thick shales, although large amounts of heavy oil lighter than bitumen are found in the Heavy Oil Belt along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, extending into Saskatchewan and approaching the Montana border. Note that, although adjacent to Alberta, Saskatchewan has no massive deposits of bitumen, only large reservoirs of heavy oil >10\u00b0API.<ref name=\"Dusseault 2001\"/><ref name=\"Hein\"/>\n\nMost of the Canadian oil sands are in three major deposits in northern [[Alberta]]. They are the [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca-Wabiskaw oil sands]] of north northeastern Alberta, the [[Cold Lake, Alberta|Cold Lake]] deposits of east northeastern Alberta, and the [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] deposits of northwestern Alberta. Between them, they cover over {{convert|140000|km2}}\u2014an area larger than [[England]]\u2014and contain approximately {{convert|1.75|Toilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of crude [[bitumen]] in them. About 10% of the [[oil in place]], or {{convert|173|Goilbbl|e9m3|abbr=on}}, is estimated by the [[government of Alberta]] to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves.<ref name=\"AOS2008\"/> Although the Athabasca deposit is the only one in the world which has areas shallow enough to mine from the surface, all three Alberta areas are suitable for production using ''[[in-situ]]'' methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD).\n\nThe largest Canadian oil sands deposit, the [[Athabasca oil sands]] is in the [[McMurray Formation]], centered on the city of [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]]. It outcrops on the surface (zero burial depth) about {{convert|50|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} north of Fort McMurray, where enormous oil sands mines have been established, but is {{cvt|400|m|ft}} deep southeast of Fort McMurray.

They are by far the largest deposit of bitumen in Canada, probably containing over 150 billion cubic metres (900 billion barrels) of [[oil in place]]. The bitumen is highly viscous and is often denser than water (10\u00b0[[API gravity|API]] or 1000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>). The oil saturated sands range from {{convert|15|to|65|m}} thick in places, and the oil saturation in the oil-rich zones is on the order of 90% bitumen by weight.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/>\n\nThe Athabasca River cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed as black stains on the river banks. Since portions of the Athabasca sands are shallow enough to be surface-mineable, they were the earliest ones to see development. [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada, part two|Historically]], the bitumen was used by the indigenous [[Cree]] and [[Dene]] [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] to waterproof their canoes. The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European [[fur trade]]rs in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post at [[York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]].\n\n[[File:Alberta tar sands.jpg|thumb|Oil sands on the banks of the Athabasca River, c. 1900]]\n\nIn 1778, [[Peter Pond]], a fur trader for the rival [[North West Company]], was the first European to see the Athabasca deposits. In 1788, fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] from the Hudson Bay Company, who later discovered the [[Mackenzie River]] and routes to both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, described the oil sands in great detail. He said, \"At about {{convert|24|mi}} from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of {{convert|20|ft}} long may be inserted without the least resistance. The bitumen is in a fluid state and when mixed with gum, the resinous substance collected from the [[spruce]] fir, it serves to gum the Indians' canoes.\"\n\nIn 1883, G.C. Hoffman of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] tried separating the bitumen from oil sand with the use of water and reported that it separated readily. In 1888, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]] of the Geological Survey of Canada reported to a Senate Committee that \"The evidence ... points to the existence in the Athabasca and Mackenzie valleys of the most extensive petroleum field in America, if not the world.\" In 1926, [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Karl Clark]] of the University of Alberta patented a hot water separation process which was the forerunner of today's thermal extraction processes. However, it was 1967 before the first large scale commercial operation began with the opening of the Great Canadian Oil Sands mine by the [[Sun Oil Company]] of Ohio.\n\nThe commercial possibilities of Canada's vast oil sands were realized early by Canadian government researchers. In 1884, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]] of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] commented, \"The banks of the Athabasca would furnish an inexhaustible supply of fuel... the material occurs in such enormous quantities that a profitable means of extracting oil...may be found\". In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the material to pave {{convert|600|feet|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of road in Edmonton as well as in other places. In 1920, chemist [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Karl Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] began experimenting with methods to extract bitumen from the oil sands and in 1928 he patented the first commercial hot water separation process.<ref name=\"OSDC\">{{cite web| url = http://www.history.alberta.ca/oilsands/resources/docs/facts_sheets09.pdf| title = Facts about Alberta's oil sands and its industry| website = www.oilsandsdiscovery.com| publisher = Government of Alberta| accessdate = 2014-06-15}}</ref>\n\nCommercial development began in 1923 when businessman Robert Fitzsimmons began drilling oil wells at Bitumount, north of [[Fort McMurray]] but obtained disappointing results with conventional drilling. In 1927 he formed the International Bitumen Company and in 1930 built a small hot-water separation plant based on Clark's design. He produced about {{convert|300|oilbbl|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of bitumen in 1930 and shipped it by barge and rail to Edmonton. The bitumen from the mine had numerous uses but most of it was used to waterproof roofs. Costs were too high and Fitzsimmons went bankrupt. In 1941 the company was renamed Oil Sands Limited and attempted to iron out technical problems but was never very successful. It went through several changes of ownership and in 1958 closed down permanently. In 1974 Bitumount became an Alberta Provincial Historic Site.\n\nIn 1930 businessman Max Ball formed Canadian Oil Sand Product, Ltd, which later became Abasand Oils. He built a separation plant capable of handling 250 tons of oil sands per day which opened in 1936 and produced an average of {{convert|200|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of oil. The plant burned down in late 1941 but was rebuilt in 1942 with even larger capacity. In 1943 the Canadian government took control of the Abasand plant under the War Measures Act and planned to expand it further. However, in 1945 the plant burned down again and in 1946 the Canadian government abandoned the project because the need for fuel had diminished with the end of the war. The Abasand site is also an Alberta Historic Site.<ref name=\"OSDC\" />\n\nToday its successor company, [[Suncor Energy]] (no longer affiliated with Sun Oil), is the largest oil company in Canada. In addition, other companies such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[ExxonMobil]], and various national oil companies are developing the Athabasca oil sands. As a result, Canada is now by far the largest exporter of oil to the United States.\n\nThe smaller '''Wabasca''' (or Wabiskaw) '''oil sands''' lie above the western edge of the Athabasca oil sands and overlap them. They probably contain over 15 billion cubic metres (90 billion barrels) of oil in place. The deposit is buried from {{convert|100|to|700|m}} deep and ranges from {{convert|0|to|10|m}} thick. In many regions the oil-rich Wabasca formation overlies the similarly oil-rich McMurray formation, and as a result the two overlapping oil sands are often treated as one oil sands deposit. However, the two deposits are invariable separated by a minimum of {{convert|6|m}} of clay shale and silt. The bitumen in the Wabasca is as highly viscous as that in the Athabasca, but lies too deep to be surface-mined, so in-situ production methods must be used to produce the crude bitumen.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/>\n\n=====Cold Lake=====\n{{Main|Cold Lake oil sands}}\n{{See also|CFB Cold Lake}}\n[[File:Cold Lake from Meadow Lake Prov. Park, Saskatchewan.jpg|thumb|right|Cold Lake viewed from [[Meadow Lake Provincial Park]], Saskatchewan]]\n\nThe Cold Lake oil sands are northeast of [[Alberta]]'s capital, [[Edmonton]], near the border with [[Saskatchewan]]. A small portion of the Cold Lake deposit lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca oil sands, the Cold Lake oil sands are important because some of the oil is [[fluid]] enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more [[alkane]]s and less [[asphaltene]]s than the other major Alberta oil sands and the oil is more fluid.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/22_3_MONTREAL_06-77_0171.pdf| title=The Chemistry of the Alberta Oil Sand Bitumen| publisher=[[University of Alberta]]| author=O.P. Strausz| accessdate=2014-04-18| quote=}}</ref> As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production.\n\nThe Cold Lake oil sands are of a roughly circular shape, centered around [[Bonnyville, Alberta]]. They probably contain over 60 billion cubic metres (370 billion barrels) of extra-heavy oil-in-place. The oil is highly viscous, but considerably less so than the Athabasca oil sands, and is somewhat less [[sulfurous]]. The depth of the deposits is {{convert|400|to|600|m}} and they are from {{convert|15|to|35|m}} thick.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/> They are too deep to [[surface mine]].\n\nMuch of the oil sands are on [[Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]]. CFB Cold Lake's [[CF-18 Hornet]] jet fighters defend the western half of Canadian air space and cover Canada's Arctic territory. Cold Lake Air Weapons Range (CLAWR) is one of the largest live-drop bombing ranges in the world, including testing of cruise missiles. As oil sands production continues to grow, various sectors vie for access to airspace, land, and resources, and this complicates oil well drilling and production significantly.\n\n=====Peace River=====\n{{Main|Peace River oil sands}}\n[[File:Peace River aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Peace River]]\n\nThe Peace River oil sands located in northwest-central Alberta are the smallest of the three major oil sands deposits in Alberta. The Peace River oil sands lie generally in the watershed of the [[Peace River]], the largest river in Alberta. The Peace and Athabasca rivers, which are by far the largest rivers in Alberta, flow through their respective oil sands and merge at [[Lake Athabasca]] to form the [[Slave River]], which flows into the [[MacKenzie River]], one of the largest rivers in the world. All of the water from these rivers flow into the [[Arctic Ocean]].\n\nThe Peace River oil sands probably contain over 30 billion cubic metres (200 billion barrels) of oil-in-place. The thickness of the deposit ranges from {{convert|5|to|25|m}} and it is buried about {{convert|500|to|700|m}} deep.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/>\n\nWhereas the Athabasca oil sands lie close enough to the surface that the bitumen can be excavated in [[open-pit]] mines, the smaller Peace River deposits are too deep, and must be exploited using [[in situ]] methods such as [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] and Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS).<ref name=Monro2013>{{cite report|title=Peace River proceeding no. 1769924 |date=25 November 2013|series=Phase II submissions |volume=4|url=http://www.aer.ca/documents/applications/hearings/1769924-SUBMISSIONSVOLIV-20131125.pdf|format=PDF|first=Munro |last=Shawn |location=Calgary, Alberta }}</ref>\n\n====Venezuela====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe [[Orinoco#Eastern Venezuelan Basin|Eastern Venezuelan Basin]] has a structure similar to the WCSB, but on a shorter scale. The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Orientale mountain front to the [[Orinoco oil sands]] where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the [[Guyana Shield]] is only about {{convert|200|to|300|km |mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The hydrodynamic conditions of oil transport were similar, [[source rock]]s buried deep by the rise of the mountains of the Sierra Orientale produced light oil that moved up-dip toward the south until it was gradually immobilized by the viscosity increase caused by biodgradation near the surface. The Orinoco deposits are early [[Tertiary]] (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits.\n\nIn Venezuela, the [[Orinoco Belt]] oil sands range from {{convert|350|to|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep and no surface outcrops exist. The deposit is about {{convert|500|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long east-to-west and {{convert|50|to|60|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wide north-to-south, much less than the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits. In general, the Canadian deposits are found over a much wider area, have a broader range of properties, and have a broader range of reservoir types than the Venezuelan ones, but the geological structures and mechanisms involved are similar. The main differences is that the oil in the sands in Venezuela is less viscous than in Canada, allowing some of it to be produced by conventional drilling techniques, but none of it approaches the surface as in Canada, meaning none of it can be produced using surface mining. The Canadian deposits will almost all have to be produced by mining or using new non-conventional techniques.\n\n=====Orinoco=====\n{{Main|Orinoco oil sands}}\n{{See also|History of the Venezuelan oil industry}}\n{{See also|PDVSA}}\n[[File:Deltaorinoco.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of the Orinoco River]]\n\nThe Orinoco Belt is a territory in the southern strip of the eastern [[Orinoco River]] Basin in [[Venezuela]] which overlies one of the world's largest deposits of petroleum. The Orinoco Belt follows the line of the river.

These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using [[open-pit mining]], approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oilsandsdiscovery.com/oil_sands_story/insitu.html |title=The oil sands story: in situ}}</ref>\n\n===Primary production===\nConventional crude oil is normally extracted from the ground by drilling [[oil well]]s into a [[petroleum reservoir]], allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although [[artificial lift]] and techniques such as [[horizontal drilling]], [[water injection (oil production)|water flooding]] and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production is used in the Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees [[Celsius]], the typical oil recovery rates are about 8\u201312%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5\u20136%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands.

In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of [[bitumen]] covered by little [[overburden]], making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden [[muskeg]] (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically {{convert|40|to|60|m}} thick deposits of crude bitumen embedded in unconsolidated [[sandstone]], sitting on top of flat [[limestone]] rock. Since [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil)#Great Canadian Oil Sands|Great Canadian Oil Sands]] (now [[Suncor Energy]]) started operation of the first large-scale oil sands mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale and the volume has grown at a steady rate ever since.\n\nA large number of oil sands mines are currently in operation and more are in the stages of approval or development.

This technique became known as Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Further research disclosed that pumping out sand opened \"wormholes\" in the sand formation which allowed more oil to reach the [[wellbore]]. The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10% versus 5\u20136% with sand filters in place) and the disadvantage that [[waste management|disposing]] of the produced sand is a problem. A novel way to do this was spreading it on [[gravel road|rural roads]], which rural governments liked because the [[Asphalt concrete|oily sand]] reduced dust and the oil companies did their [[road maintenance]] for them. However, governments have become concerned about the large volume and composition of oil spread on roads.<ref>{{cite web | title = GL 97-02 Guidelines for the Application of Oil Byproducts to Municipal Roads in Saskatchewen | publisher = Saskatchewan Energy and Mines | year = 1997 | url = http://www.er.gov.sk.ca/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?DocID=3729,3680,3384,5460,2936,Documents&MediaID=5081&Filename=PDB+PP+01+-+Waste+Management+Guidelines+Revisited+1998.pdf | accessdate =21 May 2008}}</ref> so in recent years disposing of oily sand in underground [[salt mine|salt caverns]] has become more common.\n\n===Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS)===\n{{See also|Steam injection (oil industry)}}\n\nThe use of [[steam]] injection to recover heavy oil has been in use in the oil fields of California since the 1950s. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) \"huff-and-puff\" method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10\u201340% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60\u201370% of OIP).{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nCSS has been in use by [[Imperial Oil]] at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by [[Canadian Natural Resources]] at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by [[Shell Canada]] at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees [[Celsius]] for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.<ref name=\"butler104\">{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Roger|title=Thermal Recovery of Oil and Bitumen|year=1991|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|page=104}}</ref>\n\n===Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)===\n{{Main|Steam assisted gravity drainage}}\n\n[[Steam assisted gravity drainage]] was developed in the 1980s by the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] and fortuitously coincided with improvements in [[directional drilling]] technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically [[drilling rig|drilled]] in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.<ref name=\"butler104\"/>\n\nSAGD has proved to be a [[disruptive technology|major breakthrough]] in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its [[economic feasibility]] and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American [[oil reserves]] and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta's oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include [[JACOS|Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS)]] project, Suncor's Firebag project, [[Nexen]]'s Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, [[Husky Energy]]'s Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, [[Cenovus Energy]]'s Foster Creek<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oilsands/foster-creek.html |title=Operations&nbsp;\u2013 Oil sands&nbsp;\u2013 Foster Creek |publisher=Cenovus.com |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> and Christina Lake<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oilsands/christina-lake.html |title=Operations&nbsp;\u2013 Oil sands&nbsp;\u2013 Christina Lake |publisher=Cenovus.com |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> developments, [[ConocoPhillips]]' Surmont project, [[Devon Energy|Devon Canada's]] Jackfish project, and Derek Oil & Gas's LAK Ranch project. Alberta's OSUM Corp has combined proven underground mining technology with SAGD to enable higher recovery rates by running wells underground from within the oil sands deposit, thus also reducing energy requirements compared to traditional SAGD. This particular technology application is in its testing phase.\n\n===Vapor Extraction (VAPEX)===\nSeveral methods use solvents, instead of steam, to separate bitumen from sand. Some solvent extraction methods may work better in ''in situ'' production and other in mining.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/canmet-20120116.html |title=Natural Resources Canada team investigates solvent extraction process for oil sand bitumen; non-aqueous alternative to hot water processing with reduced environmental impacts |date=16 January 2012 |work=Green Car Congress |publisher=BioAge Group, LLC |location= }}</ref> Solvent can be beneficial if it produces more oil while requiring less energy to produce steam.\n\nVapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an ''in situ'' technology, similar to SAGD. Instead of steam, hydrocarbon solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It has the advantage of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who are experimenting with it.\n\nThe above methods are not mutually exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.<ref>{{cite web |title=VAPEX and Solvent Technology |url=http://www.oilsandsdevelopers.ca/index.php/oil-sands-technologies/in-situ/the-process-2/vapex-and-solvent-technology/ |publisher=Oil Sands Developers Group |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) ===\nThis is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the \"toe\" of the horizontal well toward the \"heel\", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and have the advantage of not requiring energy to create steam.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.petrobank.com/hea-thaiprocess.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828114934/http://www.petrobank.com/hea-thaiprocess.html | archivedate= 2008-08-28 | title= The THAI Process |website= |publisher=[[Petrobank Energy and Resources Ltd.]] | accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAdvocates of this method of extraction state that it uses less freshwater, produces 50% less [[greenhouse gases]], and has a smaller footprint than other production techniques.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2907 | title= A new method of extracting heavy oil: Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) |date= 27 August 2007 |publisher= [[The Oil Drum]] |accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Petrobank Energy and Resources]] has reported encouraging results from their test wells in Alberta, with production rates of up to {{convert|400|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} per well, and the oil upgraded from 8 to 12&nbsp;[[API gravity|API degrees]].\nThe company hopes to get a further 7-degree upgrade from its CAPRI (controlled atmospheric pressure resin infusion)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://netenergy.theoildrum.com/node/5183 |title = EROI update: preliminary results using Toe-to-Heel Air Injection |date = 18 March 2009 |website = |publisher = [[The Oil Drum]] |accessdate = 19 March 2009}}</ref> system, which pulls the oil through a [[catalyst]] lining the lower pipe.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Petrobank-Energy-And-Resources-Ltd-TSX-PBG-902105.html | title = Petrobank announces first THAI/CAPRI production | date = 22 September 2008 | website = | publisher = Petrobank | accessdate = 7 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/business/story.html?id=102d6c3c-6881-474c-9a47-0b4665266d77 | title = Petrobank wins approval for heavy-oil project expansion | last = Cooper | first = Dave | date = 29 November 2008 | work = [[The Edmonton Journal]] | accessdate = 7 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.oilweek.com/articles.asp?ID=601 |title = What lies beneath |last = Chandler |first = Graham |date = September 2008 |work = Oilweek |accessdate = 7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter several years of production in situ, it has become clear that current THAI methods do not work as planned.

Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30\u201335% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude. Nexen's Long Lake project will use a proprietary deasphalting technology to upgrade the bitumen, using asphaltene residue fed to a [[gasification|gasifier]] whose [[syngas]] will be used by a [[cogeneration]] turbine and a hydrogen producing unit, providing all the energy needs of the project: steam, hydrogen, and electricity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Technology |url=http://www.longlake.ca/project/technology.asp}}</ref> Thus, it will produce syncrude without consuming natural gas, but the capital cost is very high.\n\nShortages of natural gas for project fuel were forecast to be a problem for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US [[shale gas]] production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of [[hydraulic fracturing]] making [[Shale gas in the United States|US largely self-sufficient in natural gas]] and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the [[NAFTA]] and the [[Canadian Constitution]] to reduce shipments of natural gas to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has [[Shale gas in Canada|huge undeveloped shale gas deposits]] in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future oil sands production does not seem to be a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production.\n\n==Upgrading and/or blending==\n{{See also|Upgrader}}\nThe extra-heavy crude oil or crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is a very [[viscous]] semisolid form of oil that does not easily flow at normal temperatures, making it difficult to transport to market by pipeline. To flow through oil pipelines, it must either be [[upgrader|upgraded]] to lighter [[synthetic crude oil]] (SCO), blended with [[diluent]]s to form [[dilbit]], or heated to reduce its viscosity.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the Canadian oil sands, bitumen produced by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery of oil to market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen produced by the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported to the site of upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude.\n\nUpon reaching a [[oil refinery|refinery]], the synthetic crude is processed and a significant portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable.\n\nWhen the first oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil refineries in their market area were designed to handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4\u20137% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high-quality synthetic crude oil (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil.\n\n[[Western Canadian Select]], launched in 2004 as a new heavy oil stream, blended at the [[Husky Energy]] terminal in [[Hardisty, Alberta|Hardisty]], [[Alberta]],<ref name=\"CAPP_2013\">{{citation|url=http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=221341&DT=NTV| work=CAPP |date=2013-11-20|title=Alberta Oil Sands Bitumen Valuation Methodology|series=Technical Publication|accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref>\nis the largest crude oil stream coming from the Canadian oil sands and the [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for emerging heavy, high TAN (acidic) crudes.<ref name=\"Argus_2012\">{{citation|url=http://www.argusmedia.com/Petroleum/Crude/~/media/Files/PDFs/White%20Paper/Argus%20WCS%20at%20Cushing.ashx|title=WCS at Cushing: The emerging US trading center for Canada's heavy sour crude|year=2012|accessdate=2015-03-24|publisher=Argus Media|series=Argus White Paper|work=Argus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402203200/http://www.argusmedia.com/Petroleum/Crude/~/media/Files/PDFs/White%20Paper/Argus%20WCS%20at%20Cushing.ashx|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"NRC_Petroleum_Products\">{{cite report |author=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |date=May 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-24 |ISBN=978-1-100-16436-6 |title=Canadian Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Petroleum Products: Review of 2009 & Outlook to 2030 |url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca.energy/files/pdf/eneene/sources/crubru/revrev/pdf/revrev-09-eng.pdf |format=PDF |location=Ottawa, ON |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003093310/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca.energy/files/pdf/eneene/sources/crubru/revrev/pdf/revrev-09-eng.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2013 }}</ref>{{rp|9}}<ref name=\"Platts_2012\">{{citation| title=Platts Assesses Ex-Cushing Western Canadian Select at $70.78 per Barrel: Brings transparency to the US value of Canadian Oil as Seaway Takes Oil to Gulf|location=Houston, Texas| date=2012-06-01| work=Platts| url=http://www.platts.com/PressReleases/2012/060112}}</ref><ref name=\"TMX/Shorcan Energy Brokers\">{{citation |title=Western Canadian Select Heavy Oil blend |work= TMX/Shorcan Energy Brokers}}</ref> \n[[Western Canadian Select]] (WCS) is traded at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, which has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.

After that, [[de-asphalter|de-asphalting]] is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. [[Cracking (chemistry)|Cracking]] is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, [[Hydrodesulfurization|desulfurization]] must be done to get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.ualberta.ca/~gray/Links%20&%20Docs/Web%20Upgrading%20Tutorial.pdf| title = Tutorial on Upgrading of Oilsands Bitumen| last = Gray| first = Murray| website = ualberta.ca| publisher = University of Alberta| accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Alberta produced about {{convert|1900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude bitumen from its three major oil sands deposits, of which about {{convert|1044000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} was upgraded to lighter products and the rest sold as raw bitumen.  The volume of both upgraded and non-upgraded bitumen is increasing yearly. Alberta has five oil sands upgraders producing a variety of products. These include:<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Oil/pdfs/FSRefiningUpgrading.pdf| title = Upgrading and Refining| website = energy.alberta.ca| publisher = Government of Alberta| accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref>\n* [[Suncor Energy]] can upgrade {{convert|440000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to light sweet and medium sour synthetic crude oil (SCO), plus produce diesel fuel for its oil sands operations at the upgrader.\n* [[Syncrude]] can upgrade {{convert|407000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet light SCO.\n* [[Canadian Natural Resources]] Limited (CNRL) can upgrade {{convert|141000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet light SCO.\n* [[Nexen]], since 2013 wholly owned by [[China National Offshore Oil Corporation]] (CNOOC), can upgrade {{convert|72000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet light SCO.\n* [[Shell Canada]] operates its [[Scotford Upgrader]] in combination with an oil refinery and chemical plant at [[Scotford, Alberta]], near Edmonton. The complex can upgrade {{convert|255000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet and heavy SCO as well as a range of refinery and chemical products.\n\nModernized and new large refineries such as are found in the [[Midwestern United States]] and on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], as well as many in [[China]], can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, [[pentanes]] and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.\n\nTypically, blended bitumen contains about 30% [[natural gas condensate]] or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen can also be delivered to market by specially designed railway [[tank car]]s, [[tank truck]]s, [[liquid cargo barge]]s, or ocean-going [[oil tanker]]s. These do not necessarily require the bitumen be blended with diluent since the tanks can be heated to allow the oil to be pumped out.\n\nThe demand for condensate for oil sands diluent is expected to be more than {{convert|750000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about {{convert|150000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US [[tight oil]] production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport {{convert|95000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and [[Enbridge]] is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships {{convert|180000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://calgaryherald.com/business/Bitumen+diluent+demand+expected+double+2020/9696681/story.html| title = Bitumen diluent demand expected to double by 2020| last = Healing| first = Dan| date = 3 April 2014| website = calgaryherald.com| publisher = Calgary Herald| accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref>\n\n===Venezuela===\nAlthough Venezuelan extra-heavy oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of the difference is due to temperature. Once the oil comes out of the ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of {{convert|630000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of [[naphtha]] to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much [[natural gas condensate]] from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US [[shale gas]] production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems \u2013 as a result of the country's [[2013-17 Venezuelan crisis|economic crisis]] -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://blogs.platts.com/2013/11/25/pdvsa-woes/| title = At the Wellhead: Venezuela's upgraders are maxed out to handle its heavy oil| website = platts.com| publisher =  Platts, McGraw Hill Financial| accessdate = 2014-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n{{See also|Oil pipeline}}\n\nA network of gathering and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: [[Edmonton, Alberta]] and [[Hardisty, Alberta]]. Most of the feeder pipelines move blended bitumen or SCO southbound and diluent northbound, but a few move product laterally within the oil sands region. In 2012, the capacity of the southbound feeder lines was over 300,000 m\u00b3/d (2 million bbl/d) and more capacity was being added. The building of new oil sands feeder pipelines requires only the approval of the Alberta Energy Regulator, an agency that deals with matters entirely within Alberta and is likely to give little consideration to interference from political and environmental interest from outside Alberta.<ref name=\"Cairns 2013\">{{cite web| url = http://www.ctrf.ca/Proceedings/2013CrudeOilbyRailCairns.pdf| title = Crude Oil by Rail: Potential for the Movement of Alberta Oil Sands Crude Oil and Related Products by Canadian Railways| last = Cairns| first = Malcolm| year = 2013| website = ctrf.ca| publisher = Canadian Transportation Research Foundation| accessdate = 2014-04-25}}</ref>\n\n===Existing pipelines===\nFrom Edmonton and Hardisty, main transmission pipelines move blended bitumen and SCO, as well as conventional crude oil and various oil and natural productions to market destinations across North America. The main transmission systems include:<ref name=\"Cairns 2013\"/>\n\n* [[Enbridge]] has a complex existing system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty east to [[Montreal]] and south as far as the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], with a total capacity of {{convert|2.5|e6oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It also has a northbound pipeline that takes diluent from refineries in Illinois and other [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern states]] to Edmonton with a capacity of {{convert|160000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of light hydrocarbons.\n* [[Kinder Morgan]] has the Trans Mountain Pipeline that takes crude oil from Edmonton over the Rocky Mountains to the west coasts of British Columbia and Washington State, with an existing capacity of {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It has plans to add an additional {{convert|450000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of capacity to this pipeline within the existing pipeline [[easement]].\n* [[Spectra Energy]] has a system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Hardisty south to [[Casper, Wyoming]] and then east to [[Wood River, Illinois]]. The first segment has a capacity of {{convert|280000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} and the second segment {{convert|160000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.\n* [[TransCanada Corporation]] has the [[Keystone Pipeline]] system. Phase 1 currently takes crude oil from Hardisty south to [[Steele City, Nebraska]] and then east to [[Wood River, Illinois]]. The existing Phase 2 moves crude oil from Steele City to the main US oil marketing hub at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]]. Phases 1 and 2 have a combined capacity of {{convert|590000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.\n\nOverall, the total pipeline capacity for the movement of crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty to the rest of North America is about {{convert|3.5|e6oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. However, other substances such as conventional crude oil and refined petroleum products also share this pipeline network. The rapidly increasing [[tight oil]] production from the [[Bakken formation]] of [[North Dakota]] also competes for space on the Canadian export pipeline system. North Dakota oil producers are using the Canadian pipelines to deliver their oil to US refineries.\n\nIn 2012, the Canadian export pipeline system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented [[Rationing|pipeline apportionment]] on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space by reducing the monthly allocation of each shipper to a certain percentage of its requirements. The [[Chevron Corporation]] [[Burnaby Refinery]], the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate [[NAFTA]] equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota [[tight oil]] production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n\nIn addition, the US oil marketing hub at Cushing was flooded with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to take it from there to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of [[West Texas Intermediate]] delivered at Cushing, which is the main [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as [[Brent Crude]] and [[Dubai Crude]]. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as ''the price of oil'', this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast.\n\n===New pipelines===\nLack of access to markets, limited export capacity, and oversupply in the US market have been a problem for oil sands producers in recent years. They have caused lower prices to Canadian oil sands producers and reduced royalty and tax revenues to Canadian governments. The pipeline companies have moved forward with a number of solutions to the transportation problems:<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n* Enbridge's line from [[Sarnia, Ontario]] to Westover, Ontario near the head of [[Lake Erie]] has been reversed. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in the Sarnia area. Now it takes Alberta SCO and blended bitumen to most refineries in Ontario.\n* Enbridge has applied to reverse its line from Westover to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in southern Ontario. After reversal, it will take Alberta SCO and bitumen to Montreal. Since [[Suncor Energy]] owns a very large oil sands mine and upgrader in Alberta and also owns a large oil refinery in Montreal, it finds this project appealing. The alternative is closing the refinery since it is noncompetitive using offshore oil.\n*TransCanada is evaluating converting part of its mainline natural gas transmission system from western Canada to eastern North America to transport oil. Eastern North America is well supplied with natural gas as a result of the recent increases in US [[shale gas]] production, but has problems with oil supply since most of their oil comes from offshore.\n*Enbridge's [[Seaway Pipeline]] which used to take oil from the US Gulf Coast to the oil trading hub at Cushing was reversed in 2012 to take oil from Cushing to the Coast, helping to alleviate the bottleneck at Cushing. It has a capacity of {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} but Enbridge is twinning the pipeline to add an additional {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.\n*Following the denial of a US regulatory permit for its [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL pipeline]], TransCanada went ahead with the southern leg of the Keystone project. This will deliver {{convert|830000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} from Cushing to the Coast. Since it is entirely within the states of Oklahoma and Texas, it does not require US federal government approval.\n\n===Future pipelines===\nWith the main constraint on Canadian oil sands development becoming the availability of export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed a number of major new transmission pipelines. Many of these became stalled in government regulatory processes, both by the Canadian and American governments. Another factor is competition for pipeline space from rapidly increasing [[tight oil]] production from North Dakota, which under NAFTA trade rules has equal access to Canadian pipelines.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n* Enbridge has announced its intention to expand its Alberta Clipper line from {{convert|450000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|570000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} and its Southern Access line from {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|560000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It is also proposing to build a Flanagan South line with an initial capacity of {{convert|585000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} expandable to {{convert|800000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.\n* Enbridge is proposing to build the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway Pipeline]] from [[Bruderheim]], near [[Edmonton, Alberta]] to the port of [[Kitimat, BC]] for loading on [[supertanker]]s with an initial capacity of {{convert|525000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} with a reverse flow condensate pipeline to take diluent from tankers at Kitimat to Alberta. This was approved by the Canadian federal cabinet on 17 June 2014, subject to 209 conditions. After this point, the company has to satisfy most of the conditions to [[National Energy Board]] satisfaction before construction can start. Satisfying the conditions is expected to take a year or more. The leaders of both main opposition parties promised to reverse the decision if they form the government in the 2015 election.<ref name=Payton>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/northern-gateway-pipeline-approved-with-209-conditions-1.2678285| title = Northern Gateway pipeline approved with 209 conditions| last1 = Payton| first1 = Laura| last2 = Mas| first2 = Susana| date = 17 June 2014| website = cbc.ca/news| publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| accessdate = 2014-06-18}}</ref> This in fact occurred, as the [[Liberal party of Canada|Liberal party]] under [[Justin Trudeau]] won a majority government.<ref name=election>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-results-federal-election-2015-1.3278830| title = Stunning Liberal gains in Quebec as Trudeau wins majority government| date = 19 October 2015| website = cbc.ca/news| publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| accessdate = 6 November 2015}}</ref>\n* Kinder Morgan is proposing to increase the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline through British Columbia to {{convert|900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2017.

On 6 November 2015, American president [[Barack Obama]] announced that the State Department had rejected the proposed expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/06/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline|title = Statement by the President on the Keystone XL Pipeline|last = Obama|first = Barack|date = 6 November 2015|website = www.whitehouse.gov|publisher = The White House|accessdate = 7 November 2015}}</ref>\n* TransCanada has also proposed to build the {{convert|4600|km|abbr=on}} Energy East Pipeline, which would carry {{convert|1.1|e6oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of oil from Alberta to refineries in Eastern Canada, including Quebec and New Brunswick. It would also have marine facilities that would enable Alberta production to be delivered to Atlantic markets by oil tanker.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.transcanada.com/energy-east-pipeline.html| title = Energy East Pipeline Project| year = 2014| website = energyeastpipeline.com| publisher = TransCanada Pipelines Limited| accessdate = 2014-04-25}}</ref> The [[Irving Oil Refinery]] in New Brunswick, which is the largest oil refinery in Canada, is especially interested in it since its traditional sources such as [[North Sea oil]] are shrinking and international oil is more expensive than Alberta oil delivered to the Atlantic coast.\n \nIn addition, there are a large number of new pipelines proposed for Alberta. These will likely be approved rapidly by the Alberta Energy Regulator, so there are likely to be few capacity problems within Alberta.\n\n===Rail===\nThe movement of crude oil by rail is far from new, but it is now a rapidly growing market for [[Railroad classes|North American railroads]]. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.<ref name=\"Cairns 2013\"/>\n\nA single-track rail line carrying 10 trains per day, each with 120 tank cars, can move {{convert|630000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|780000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, which is the capacity of a large transmission pipeline. This would require 300 locomotives and 18,000 tank cars, which is a small part of the fleet of a Class 1 railroad. By comparison, the two Canadian Class 1 railways, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP) and [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN), have 2,400 locomotives and 65,000 freight cars between them, and CP moves 30\u201335 trains per day on its main line to Vancouver. Two US Class 1 railways, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP) and [[BNSF Railway]] handle more than 100 trains per day on their western corridors.<ref name=\"Cairns 2013\"/> CN Rail has said that it could move {{convert|1500000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen from Edmonton to the deepwater port of [[Prince Rupert, BC]] if the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Edmonton to the port of [[Kitimat, BC]] was not approved.\n\nWith many of their lines being underused, railroads find transporting crude oil an attractive source of revenue. With enough new tank cars they could carry all the new oil being produced in North America, albeit at higher prices than pipelines. In the short term, the use of rail will probably continue to grow as producers try to bypass short-term pipeline bottlenecks to take advantage of higher prices in areas with refineries capable of handling heavier crudes. In the long term the growth in rail transport will largely depend on the continued pipeline bottlenecks due to increased production in North America and regulatory delays for new pipelines. At present rail moves over {{convert|90000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude oil, and with continued growth in oil production and building of new terminals, rail movements will probably continue to grow into the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n\nBy 2013, exports of oil from Canada to the US by rail had increased 9-fold in less than two years, from {{convert|16000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in early 2012 to {{convert|146000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in late 2013, mainly because new export pipelines had been held up by regulatory delays. As a result, Canadian farmers suffered an acute shortage of rail capacity to export their grains because so much of Canada's rail capacity was tied up by oil products. The safety of rail transport of oil was being called into question after several derailments, especially after a train with 74 tank cars of oil derailed and caught fire in [[Lac Megantic, Quebec]].<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crude-by-rail-shipments-increase-9-fold-since-2012-1.2633280| title = Crude by rail shipments increase 9-fold since 2012| date = 6 May 2014 | website = cbc.ca/news| publisher = CBC News| accessdate = 2014-05-06}}</ref>\n{{See also|Lac-Megantic derailment}}\nThe ensuing explosion and firestorm burned down 40 buildings in the town center and killed 47 people. The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings may need to be demolished. Ironically, the oil was not Canadian bitumen being exported to the United States but [[Bakken formation]] [[light crude oil]] being imported into Canada from [[North Dakota]] to the [[Irving Oil Refinery]] in [[New Brunswick]]. Although near [[Canaport|a huge oil import port]] on the Atlantic Ocean, the Irving refinery is importing US Bakken oil by rail because oil from outside North America is too expensive to be economic, and there are no pipelines to deliver heavier but cheaper Western Canadian oil to New Brunswick. It was subsequently pointed out that the Bakken light oil was much more flammable than Alberta bitumen, and the rail cars were mislabeled by the North Dakota producers as to their flammability.\n\nBy 2014, the movement of crude by rail had become very profitable to oil companies. [[Suncor Energy]], Canada's largest oil company declared record profits and attributed much of it to transporting oil to market by rail. It was moving about {{convert|70000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], and putting it into TransCanada's new Gulf Coast pipeline \u2013 which was originally going to be the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, before the northern leg across the border from Canada was stalled by US federal government delays.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/suncor-profit-soars-on-oil-prices-weak-loonie/article18319278/#dashboard/follows/| title = Suncor kicks off strong earnings season for energy sector| last = Cryderman| first = Kelly| date = 29 April 2014| website = theglobeandmail.com| publisher = Toronto Globe and Mail| accessdate = 2014-04-29}}</ref>\n\nSuncor has also been moving {{convert|20000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of Alberta bitumen and North Dakota tight oil by rail to its [[Montreal Refinery]] with plans to increase it to {{convert|35000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.

However, it was also anticipating the reversal of [[Enbridge]]'s Line 9 from southwestern Ontario to Montreal to deliver {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} oil even cheaper.

This pre-processing is called 'upgrading', the key components of which are as follows:\n# removal of water, sand, physical waste, and lighter products\n# catalytic purification by [[hydrodemetallisation]] (HDM), [[hydrodesulfurization]] (HDS) and [[hydrodenitrogenation]] (HDN)\n# hydrogenation through carbon rejection or [[catalytic hydrocracking]] (HCR)\n\nAs carbon rejection is very inefficient and wasteful in most cases, [[catalytic hydrocracking]] is preferred in most cases. All these processes take large amounts of energy and water, while emitting more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.\n\nCatalytic purification and hydrocracking are together known as [[hydroprocessing]]. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is to deal with the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time. Many efforts have been made to deal with this to ensure high activity and long life of a catalyst. Catalyst materials and pore size distributions are key parameters that need to be optimized to deal with this challenge and varies from place to place, depending on the kind of feedstock present.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ancheyta Jorge |author2=Rana Mohan S. |author3=Furimsky Edward |title=Hydroprocessing of heavy petroleum feeds: Tutorial |journal=Catalysis Today |issn=0920-5861 |volume=109 |issue=1\u20134 |date=30 November 2005 |pages=3\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2005.08.025}}</ref>\n\n===Alberta===\n{{See also|List of oil refineries#Alberta}}\n\nThere are four major [[oil refineries]] in Alberta which supply most of [[Western Canada]] with [[petroleum products]], but as of 2012 these processed less than 1/4 of the approximately {{convert|1900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen and SCO produced in Alberta.

Since the 1970s, the number of oil refineries in Canada has declined from 40 to 19. There hasn't been a new oil refinery (other than oil sands upgraders) built in Canada since 1984.\n\nMost of the Canadian oil refining industry is foreign-owned, and except for Alberta, international companies preferred to build refining capacity elsewhere than in Canada. The result is a serious imbalance between Canadian oil production versus Canadian oil refining. Although Canada produces much more oil than it refines, and exports more oil and refined products than it consumes, most of the new production is heavier than traditional oil and concentrated in the [[landlocked]] provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Canadian refineries have pipeline access to and can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada. The remainder of Canadian oil production is exported, almost all of it to the US. At the same time Canada imports {{convert|700000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude oil from other countries and exports much of the oil products to other countries, most of it to the US.<ref name=\"Mendelson\">{{cite web| url = http://science.ucalgary.ca/iseee/news/why-arent-we-building-refineries-canada-because-its-too-late-experts-say| title = Why Aren't We Building Refineries in Canada?

With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of [[Quebec]], the [[Atlantic Provinces]], and [[British Columbia]] where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel.<ref name=\"Mendelson\"/>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of oil refineries#United States|North American energy independence|Western Canadian Select}}\nPrior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was the largest oil importer in the world.<ref>{{cite news|title=China overtakes US as the biggest importer of oil|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475934|accessdate=2014-05-11|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 October 2013}}</ref> Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, many of which have been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined. The main market for Canadian bitumen as well as Venezuelan extra-heavy oil was assumed to be the US. The United States has historically been Canada's largest customer for crude oil and products, particularly in recent years. American imports of oil and products from Canada grew from {{convert | 450000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} in 1981 to {{convert | 3120000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} in 2013 as Canada's oil sands produced more and more oil, while in the US, domestic production and imports from other countries declined.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MTTIMUSCA2&f=A| title = US Imports from Canada of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products| date = 29 April 2014| publisher = U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]]| accessdate = 2014-05-28}}</ref> However, this relationship is becoming strained due to physical, economic and political influences. Export pipeline capacity is approaching its limits; Canadian oil is selling at a discount to world market prices; US demand for crude oil and product imports has declined because of US economic problems; and US oil domestic unconventional oil production (shale oil production from [[fracking]] is growing rapidly.  The US resumed export of crude oil in 2016; as of early 2019, the US produced as much oil as it consumed, with shale oil displacing Canadian imports.\n\nFor the benefit of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian producers created a new [[benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] called [[Western Canadian Select]], (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy crude oils. This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19\u201321 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as \"conventional heavy oil\" by governments. There are several hundred thousand barrels per day of this blend being imported into the US, in addition to larger amounts of crude bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO) from the oil sands.\n\nThe demand from US refineries is increasingly for non-upgraded bitumen rather than SCO. The Canadian [[National Energy Board]] (NEB) expects SCO volumes to double to around {{convert|1900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2035, but not keep pace with the total increase in bitumen production. It projects that the portion of oil sands production that is upgraded to SCO to decline from 49% in 2010 to 37% in 2035. This implies that over {{convert|3200000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen will have to be blended with diluent for delivery to market.\n\n{{See also | Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts}}\n\n===Asia===\n{{See also|Petroleum industry in China}}\nDemand for oil in Asia has been growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China replaced the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production. The main impediment to Canadian exports to Asia is pipeline capacity \u2013 The only pipeline capable of delivering oil sands production to Canada's Pacific Coast is the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver, which is now operating at its capacity of {{convert | 300000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d | abbr=on}} supplying refineries in B.C. and Washington State.

Canada has vast energy resources of all types and its oil and natural gas resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant [[hydroelectric]] resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. \n\nThe [[National Energy Board]] (NEB) reported in 2013, that if oil prices are above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs. The excess oil production from the oil sands could be exported. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.<ref name=\"NEB2013\">{{cite web| url = http://www.neb-one.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rnrgynfmtn/nrgyrprt/nrgyftr/2013/nrgftr2013-eng.html#s5| title = Canada's Energy Future 2013 \u2013 Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2035 \u2013 An Energy Market Assessment| date = November 2013| website = neb-one.gc.ca| publisher = National Energy Board of Canada (NEB)| accessdate = 2014-04-20}}</ref>\n\nCanada has abundant resources of bitumen and crude oil, with an estimated remaining ultimate resource potential of 54 billion cubic metres (340 billion barrels). Of this, oil sands bitumen accounts for 90 per cent. Alberta currently accounts for all of Canada's bitumen resources. \"Resources\" become \"reserves\" only after it is proven that economic recovery can be achieved. At 2013 prices using current technology, Canada had remaining oil reserves of 27 billion m<sup>3</sup> (170 billion bbls), with 98% of this attributed to oil sands bitumen. This put its reserves in third place in the world behind [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].  At the much lower prices of 2015, the reserves are much smaller.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Costs===\nThe costs of production and transportation of saleable petroleum from oil sands is typically significantly higher than from conventional global sources.<ref name=CERI2015/><ref name=CERI-June2015/> Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable to the [[price of oil]]. The price of [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]] above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production. Major Canadian oil companies had announced expansion plans and foreign companies were investing significant amounts of capital, in many cases forming partnerships with Canadian companies. Investment had been shifting towards [[in-situ]] [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) projects and away from mining and upgrading projects, as oil sands operators foresee better opportunities from selling bitumen and heavy oil directly to refineries than from upgrading it to [[synthetic crude oil]]. [[Cost estimates]] for Canada include the effects of the mining when the mines are returned to the environment in \"as good as or better than original condition\". Cleanup of the end products of consumption are the responsibility of the consuming jurisdictions, which are mostly in provinces or countries other than the producing one.\n\nThe Alberta government estimated that in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas the cost of new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aer.ca/documents/sts/ST98/ST98-2013.pdf | title =  ST98-2013: Alberta's Energy Reserves 2012 and Supply/Demand Outlook 2013\u20132022 | publisher = Alberta Energy Regulator | date = May 2013 | accessdate = 2015-04-23}}</ref> These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors.

The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil without upgrading.\n\nThe [[Canadian Energy Research Institute]] (CERI) performed an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl.<ref name=CERI2012>{{cite web| url = http://www.ceri.ca/images/stories/2013-06-10_CERI_Study_133_-_Oil_Sands_Update_2012-2046.pdf| title = Canadian Oil Sands Supply Costs and Development Projects (2012\u20132046) | last1 = Millington| first1 = Dinara| last2 =  Murillo |first2 =  Carlos A.| date = May 2013| website = ceri.ca| publisher = [[Canadian Energy Research Institute]]| accessdate = 2014-04-24}}</ref> Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were expected to be consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred to spend that extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil.\n\nThen in late 2014 the dramatic rise in U.S. production from shale formations, combined with a global economic malaise that reduced demand, caused the price of WTI to drop below $50, where it remained as of late 2015.<ref name=Pope>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-08/why-you-should-short-public-oil-companies|title= Why You Should Short Public Oil Companies | last=Pope | first = Carl | work= [[Bloomberg News]] |publisher= [[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date= 8 July 2015|accessdate=6 November 2015 }}</ref> \nIn 2015, the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) re-estimated the average plant gate costs (again including 10% profit margin) of SAGD to be $58.65/bbl, and 70.18/bbl for mining without upgrading.

Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m<sup>3</sup>/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth would likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods.\n\nAn additional assumption is that there would be sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this were a limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another assumption is that US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of [[tight oil]] production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on [[United States energy independence|imported crude]]. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain.

In the absence of other constraints on further development, the oil and gas industry would need to fill tens of thousands of job openings in the next few years as a result of industry activity levels as well as age-related attrition. In the longer term, under a scenario of higher oil and gas prices, the labor shortages would continue to get worse. A potential labor shortage can increase construction costs and slow the pace of oil sands development.<ref name=\"NEB2013\"/>\n\nThe skilled worker shortage was much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company [[PDVSA]] fired most of its heavy oil experts after the [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002\u201303]], and wound down the production of [[Orimulsion]], which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry|re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry]] and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.\n\nAs of late 2015, development of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations.<ref name=Penty/> Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the [[European Community]] and China.

The bitumen is highly viscous and is often denser than water (10\u00b0[[API gravity|API]] or 1000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>). The oil saturated sands range from {{convert|15|to|65|m}} thick in places, and the oil saturation in the oil-rich zones is on the order of 90% bitumen by weight.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/>\n\nThe Athabasca River cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed as black stains on the river banks. Since portions of the Athabasca sands are shallow enough to be surface-mineable, they were the earliest ones to see development. [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada, part two|Historically]], the bitumen was used by the indigenous [[Cree]] and [[Dene]] [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] to waterproof their canoes. The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European [[fur trade]]rs in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post at [[York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]].\n\n[[File:Alberta tar sands.jpg|thumb|Oil sands on the banks of the Athabasca River, c. 1900]]\n\nIn 1778, [[Peter Pond]], a fur trader for the rival [[North West Company]], was the first European to see the Athabasca deposits. In 1788, fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] from the Hudson Bay Company, who later discovered the [[Mackenzie River]] and routes to both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, described the oil sands in great detail. He said, \"At about {{convert|24|mi}} from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of {{convert|20|ft}} long may be inserted without the least resistance. The bitumen is in a fluid state and when mixed with gum, the resinous substance collected from the [[spruce]] fir, it serves to gum the Indians' canoes.\"\n\nIn 1883, G.C. Hoffman of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] tried separating the bitumen from oil sand with the use of water and reported that it separated readily. In 1888, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]] of the Geological Survey of Canada reported to a Senate Committee that \"The evidence ... points to the existence in the Athabasca and Mackenzie valleys of the most extensive petroleum field in America, if not the world.\" In 1926, [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Karl Clark]] of the University of Alberta patented a hot water separation process which was the forerunner of today's thermal extraction processes. However, it was 1967 before the first large scale commercial operation began with the opening of the Great Canadian Oil Sands mine by the [[Sun Oil Company]] of Ohio.\n\nThe commercial possibilities of Canada's vast oil sands were realized early by Canadian government researchers. In 1884, [[Robert Bell (geologist)|Robert Bell]] of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] commented, \"The banks of the Athabasca would furnish an inexhaustible supply of fuel... the material occurs in such enormous quantities that a profitable means of extracting oil...may be found\". In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the material to pave {{convert|600|feet|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of road in Edmonton as well as in other places. In 1920, chemist [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Karl Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] began experimenting with methods to extract bitumen from the oil sands and in 1928 he patented the first commercial hot water separation process.<ref name=\"OSDC\">{{cite web| url = http://www.history.alberta.ca/oilsands/resources/docs/facts_sheets09.pdf| title = Facts about Alberta's oil sands and its industry| website = www.oilsandsdiscovery.com| publisher = Government of Alberta| accessdate = 2014-06-15}}</ref>\n\nCommercial development began in 1923 when businessman Robert Fitzsimmons began drilling oil wells at Bitumount, north of [[Fort McMurray]] but obtained disappointing results with conventional drilling. In 1927 he formed the International Bitumen Company and in 1930 built a small hot-water separation plant based on Clark's design. He produced about {{convert|300|oilbbl|m3|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of bitumen in 1930 and shipped it by barge and rail to Edmonton. The bitumen from the mine had numerous uses but most of it was used to waterproof roofs. Costs were too high and Fitzsimmons went bankrupt. In 1941 the company was renamed Oil Sands Limited and attempted to iron out technical problems but was never very successful. It went through several changes of ownership and in 1958 closed down permanently. In 1974 Bitumount became an Alberta Provincial Historic Site.\n\nIn 1930 businessman Max Ball formed Canadian Oil Sand Product, Ltd, which later became Abasand Oils. He built a separation plant capable of handling 250 tons of oil sands per day which opened in 1936 and produced an average of {{convert|200|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of oil. The plant burned down in late 1941 but was rebuilt in 1942 with even larger capacity. In 1943 the Canadian government took control of the Abasand plant under the War Measures Act and planned to expand it further. However, in 1945 the plant burned down again and in 1946 the Canadian government abandoned the project because the need for fuel had diminished with the end of the war. The Abasand site is also an Alberta Historic Site.<ref name=\"OSDC\" />\n\nToday its successor company, [[Suncor Energy]] (no longer affiliated with Sun Oil), is the largest oil company in Canada. In addition, other companies such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[ExxonMobil]], and various national oil companies are developing the Athabasca oil sands. As a result, Canada is now by far the largest exporter of oil to the United States.\n\nThe smaller '''Wabasca''' (or Wabiskaw) '''oil sands''' lie above the western edge of the Athabasca oil sands and overlap them. They probably contain over 15 billion cubic metres (90 billion barrels) of oil in place. The deposit is buried from {{convert|100|to|700|m}} deep and ranges from {{convert|0|to|10|m}} thick. In many regions the oil-rich Wabasca formation overlies the similarly oil-rich McMurray formation, and as a result the two overlapping oil sands are often treated as one oil sands deposit. However, the two deposits are invariable separated by a minimum of {{convert|6|m}} of clay shale and silt. The bitumen in the Wabasca is as highly viscous as that in the Athabasca, but lies too deep to be surface-mined, so in-situ production methods must be used to produce the crude bitumen.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/>\n\n=====Cold Lake=====\n{{Main|Cold Lake oil sands}}\n{{See also|CFB Cold Lake}}\n[[File:Cold Lake from Meadow Lake Prov. Park, Saskatchewan.jpg|thumb|right|Cold Lake viewed from [[Meadow Lake Provincial Park]], Saskatchewan]]\n\nThe Cold Lake oil sands are northeast of [[Alberta]]'s capital, [[Edmonton]], near the border with [[Saskatchewan]]. A small portion of the Cold Lake deposit lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca oil sands, the Cold Lake oil sands are important because some of the oil is [[fluid]] enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more [[alkane]]s and less [[asphaltene]]s than the other major Alberta oil sands and the oil is more fluid.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/22_3_MONTREAL_06-77_0171.pdf| title=The Chemistry of the Alberta Oil Sand Bitumen| publisher=[[University of Alberta]]| author=O.P.

They probably contain over 60 billion cubic metres (370 billion barrels) of extra-heavy oil-in-place. The oil is highly viscous, but considerably less so than the Athabasca oil sands, and is somewhat less [[sulfurous]]. The depth of the deposits is {{convert|400|to|600|m}} and they are from {{convert|15|to|35|m}} thick.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/> They are too deep to [[surface mine]].\n\nMuch of the oil sands are on [[Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]]. CFB Cold Lake's [[CF-18 Hornet]] jet fighters defend the western half of Canadian air space and cover Canada's Arctic territory. Cold Lake Air Weapons Range (CLAWR) is one of the largest live-drop bombing ranges in the world, including testing of cruise missiles. As oil sands production continues to grow, various sectors vie for access to airspace, land, and resources, and this complicates oil well drilling and production significantly.\n\n=====Peace River=====\n{{Main|Peace River oil sands}}\n[[File:Peace River aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Peace River]]\n\nThe Peace River oil sands located in northwest-central Alberta are the smallest of the three major oil sands deposits in Alberta. The Peace River oil sands lie generally in the watershed of the [[Peace River]], the largest river in Alberta. The Peace and Athabasca rivers, which are by far the largest rivers in Alberta, flow through their respective oil sands and merge at [[Lake Athabasca]] to form the [[Slave River]], which flows into the [[MacKenzie River]], one of the largest rivers in the world. All of the water from these rivers flow into the [[Arctic Ocean]].\n\nThe Peace River oil sands probably contain over 30 billion cubic metres (200 billion barrels) of oil-in-place. The thickness of the deposit ranges from {{convert|5|to|25|m}} and it is buried about {{convert|500|to|700|m}} deep.<ref name=\"Dusseault_2002_A1\"/>\n\nWhereas the Athabasca oil sands lie close enough to the surface that the bitumen can be excavated in [[open-pit]] mines, the smaller Peace River deposits are too deep, and must be exploited using [[in situ]] methods such as [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] and Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS).<ref name=Monro2013>{{cite report|title=Peace River proceeding no. 1769924 |date=25 November 2013|series=Phase II submissions |volume=4|url=http://www.aer.ca/documents/applications/hearings/1769924-SUBMISSIONSVOLIV-20131125.pdf|format=PDF|first=Munro |last=Shawn |location=Calgary, Alberta }}</ref>\n\n====Venezuela====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe [[Orinoco#Eastern Venezuelan Basin|Eastern Venezuelan Basin]] has a structure similar to the WCSB, but on a shorter scale. The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Orientale mountain front to the [[Orinoco oil sands]] where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the [[Guyana Shield]] is only about {{convert|200|to|300|km |mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The hydrodynamic conditions of oil transport were similar, [[source rock]]s buried deep by the rise of the mountains of the Sierra Orientale produced light oil that moved up-dip toward the south until it was gradually immobilized by the viscosity increase caused by biodgradation near the surface. The Orinoco deposits are early [[Tertiary]] (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits.\n\nIn Venezuela, the [[Orinoco Belt]] oil sands range from {{convert|350|to|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep and no surface outcrops exist. The deposit is about {{convert|500|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long east-to-west and {{convert|50|to|60|km|mile|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wide north-to-south, much less than the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits. In general, the Canadian deposits are found over a much wider area, have a broader range of properties, and have a broader range of reservoir types than the Venezuelan ones, but the geological structures and mechanisms involved are similar. The main differences is that the oil in the sands in Venezuela is less viscous than in Canada, allowing some of it to be produced by conventional drilling techniques, but none of it approaches the surface as in Canada, meaning none of it can be produced using surface mining. The Canadian deposits will almost all have to be produced by mining or using new non-conventional techniques.\n\n=====Orinoco=====\n{{Main|Orinoco oil sands}}\n{{See also|History of the Venezuelan oil industry}}\n{{See also|PDVSA}}\n[[File:Deltaorinoco.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of the Orinoco River]]\n\nThe Orinoco Belt is a territory in the southern strip of the eastern [[Orinoco River]] Basin in [[Venezuela]] which overlies one of the world's largest deposits of petroleum.

This technique became known as Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Further research disclosed that pumping out sand opened \"wormholes\" in the sand formation which allowed more oil to reach the [[wellbore]]. The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10% versus 5\u20136% with sand filters in place) and the disadvantage that [[waste management|disposing]] of the produced sand is a problem. A novel way to do this was spreading it on [[gravel road|rural roads]], which rural governments liked because the [[Asphalt concrete|oily sand]] reduced dust and the oil companies did their [[road maintenance]] for them.

The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) \"huff-and-puff\" method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10\u201340% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60\u201370% of OIP).{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nCSS has been in use by [[Imperial Oil]] at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by [[Canadian Natural Resources]] at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by [[Shell Canada]] at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees [[Celsius]] for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.<ref name=\"butler104\">{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Roger|title=Thermal Recovery of Oil and Bitumen|year=1991|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|page=104}}</ref>\n\n===Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)===\n{{Main|Steam assisted gravity drainage}}\n\n[[Steam assisted gravity drainage]] was developed in the 1980s by the [[Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority]] and fortuitously coincided with improvements in [[directional drilling]] technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically [[drilling rig|drilled]] in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.<ref name=\"butler104\"/>\n\nSAGD has proved to be a [[disruptive technology|major breakthrough]] in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its [[economic feasibility]] and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American [[oil reserves]] and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta's oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include [[JACOS|Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS)]] project, Suncor's Firebag project, [[Nexen]]'s Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, [[Husky Energy]]'s Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, [[Cenovus Energy]]'s Foster Creek<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oilsands/foster-creek.html |title=Operations&nbsp;\u2013 Oil sands&nbsp;\u2013 Foster Creek |publisher=Cenovus.com |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> and Christina Lake<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenovus.com/operations/oilsands/christina-lake.html |title=Operations&nbsp;\u2013 Oil sands&nbsp;\u2013 Christina Lake |publisher=Cenovus.com |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> developments, [[ConocoPhillips]]' Surmont project, [[Devon Energy|Devon Canada's]] Jackfish project, and Derek Oil & Gas's LAK Ranch project.

This particular technology application is in its testing phase.\n\n===Vapor Extraction (VAPEX)===\nSeveral methods use solvents, instead of steam, to separate bitumen from sand. Some solvent extraction methods may work better in ''in situ'' production and other in mining.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/canmet-20120116.html |title=Natural Resources Canada team investigates solvent extraction process for oil sand bitumen; non-aqueous alternative to hot water processing with reduced environmental impacts |date=16 January 2012 |work=Green Car Congress |publisher=BioAge Group, LLC |location= }}</ref> Solvent can be beneficial if it produces more oil while requiring less energy to produce steam.\n\nVapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an ''in situ'' technology, similar to SAGD. Instead of steam, hydrocarbon solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It has the advantage of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who are experimenting with it.\n\nThe above methods are not mutually exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs.<ref>{{cite web |title=VAPEX and Solvent Technology |url=http://www.oilsandsdevelopers.ca/index.php/oil-sands-technologies/in-situ/the-process-2/vapex-and-solvent-technology/ |publisher=Oil Sands Developers Group |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) ===\nThis is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the \"toe\" of the horizontal well toward the \"heel\", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and have the advantage of not requiring energy to create steam.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.petrobank.com/hea-thaiprocess.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080828114934/http://www.petrobank.com/hea-thaiprocess.html | archivedate= 2008-08-28 | title= The THAI Process |website= |publisher=[[Petrobank Energy and Resources Ltd.]] | accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAdvocates of this method of extraction state that it uses less freshwater, produces 50% less [[greenhouse gases]], and has a smaller footprint than other production techniques.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2907 | title= A new method of extracting heavy oil: Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) |date= 27 August 2007 |publisher= [[The Oil Drum]] |accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Petrobank Energy and Resources]] has reported encouraging results from their test wells in Alberta, with production rates of up to {{convert|400|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} per well, and the oil upgraded from 8 to 12&nbsp;[[API gravity|API degrees]].\nThe company hopes to get a further 7-degree upgrade from its CAPRI (controlled atmospheric pressure resin infusion)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://netenergy.theoildrum.com/node/5183 |title = EROI update: preliminary results using Toe-to-Heel Air Injection |date = 18 March 2009 |website = |publisher = [[The Oil Drum]] |accessdate = 19 March 2009}}</ref> system, which pulls the oil through a [[catalyst]] lining the lower pipe.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Petrobank-Energy-And-Resources-Ltd-TSX-PBG-902105.html | title = Petrobank announces first THAI/CAPRI production | date = 22 September 2008 | website = | publisher = Petrobank | accessdate = 7 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/business/story.html?id=102d6c3c-6881-474c-9a47-0b4665266d77 | title = Petrobank wins approval for heavy-oil project expansion | last = Cooper | first = Dave | date = 29 November 2008 | work = [[The Edmonton Journal]] | accessdate = 7 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.oilweek.com/articles.asp?ID=601 |title = What lies beneath |last = Chandler |first = Graham |date = September 2008 |work = Oilweek |accessdate = 7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter several years of production in situ, it has become clear that current THAI methods do not work as planned.

Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30\u201335% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude. Nexen's Long Lake project will use a proprietary deasphalting technology to upgrade the bitumen, using asphaltene residue fed to a [[gasification|gasifier]] whose [[syngas]] will be used by a [[cogeneration]] turbine and a hydrogen producing unit, providing all the energy needs of the project: steam, hydrogen, and electricity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Technology |url=http://www.longlake.ca/project/technology.asp}}</ref> Thus, it will produce syncrude without consuming natural gas, but the capital cost is very high.\n\nShortages of natural gas for project fuel were forecast to be a problem for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US [[shale gas]] production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of [[hydraulic fracturing]] making [[Shale gas in the United States|US largely self-sufficient in natural gas]] and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the [[NAFTA]] and the [[Canadian Constitution]] to reduce shipments of natural gas to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has [[Shale gas in Canada|huge undeveloped shale gas deposits]] in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future oil sands production does not seem to be a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production.\n\n==Upgrading and/or blending==\n{{See also|Upgrader}}\nThe extra-heavy crude oil or crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is a very [[viscous]] semisolid form of oil that does not easily flow at normal temperatures, making it difficult to transport to market by pipeline. To flow through oil pipelines, it must either be [[upgrader|upgraded]] to lighter [[synthetic crude oil]] (SCO), blended with [[diluent]]s to form [[dilbit]], or heated to reduce its viscosity.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the Canadian oil sands, bitumen produced by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery of oil to market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen produced by the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported to the site of upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude.\n\nUpon reaching a [[oil refinery|refinery]], the synthetic crude is processed and a significant portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable.\n\nWhen the first oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil refineries in their market area were designed to handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4\u20137% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high-quality synthetic crude oil (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil.\n\n[[Western Canadian Select]], launched in 2004 as a new heavy oil stream, blended at the [[Husky Energy]] terminal in [[Hardisty, Alberta|Hardisty]], [[Alberta]],<ref name=\"CAPP_2013\">{{citation|url=http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=221341&DT=NTV| work=CAPP |date=2013-11-20|title=Alberta Oil Sands Bitumen Valuation Methodology|series=Technical Publication|accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref>\nis the largest crude oil stream coming from the Canadian oil sands and the [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for emerging heavy, high TAN (acidic) crudes.<ref name=\"Argus_2012\">{{citation|url=http://www.argusmedia.com/Petroleum/Crude/~/media/Files/PDFs/White%20Paper/Argus%20WCS%20at%20Cushing.ashx|title=WCS at Cushing: The emerging US trading center for Canada's heavy sour crude|year=2012|accessdate=2015-03-24|publisher=Argus Media|series=Argus White Paper|work=Argus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402203200/http://www.argusmedia.com/Petroleum/Crude/~/media/Files/PDFs/White%20Paper/Argus%20WCS%20at%20Cushing.ashx|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"NRC_Petroleum_Products\">{{cite report |author=Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |date=May 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-24 |ISBN=978-1-100-16436-6 |title=Canadian Crude Oil, Natural Gas and Petroleum Products: Review of 2009 & Outlook to 2030 |url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca.energy/files/pdf/eneene/sources/crubru/revrev/pdf/revrev-09-eng.pdf |format=PDF |location=Ottawa, ON |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003093310/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca.energy/files/pdf/eneene/sources/crubru/revrev/pdf/revrev-09-eng.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2013 }}</ref>{{rp|9}}<ref name=\"Platts_2012\">{{citation| title=Platts Assesses Ex-Cushing Western Canadian Select at $70.78 per Barrel: Brings transparency to the US value of Canadian Oil as Seaway Takes Oil to Gulf|location=Houston, Texas| date=2012-06-01| work=Platts| url=http://www.platts.com/PressReleases/2012/060112}}</ref><ref name=\"TMX/Shorcan Energy Brokers\">{{citation |title=Western Canadian Select Heavy Oil blend |work= TMX/Shorcan Energy Brokers}}</ref> \n[[Western Canadian Select]] (WCS) is traded at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, which has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.

The complex can upgrade {{convert|255000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen to sweet and heavy SCO as well as a range of refinery and chemical products.\n\nModernized and new large refineries such as are found in the [[Midwestern United States]] and on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], as well as many in [[China]], can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, [[pentanes]] and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.\n\nTypically, blended bitumen contains about 30% [[natural gas condensate]] or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen can also be delivered to market by specially designed railway [[tank car]]s, [[tank truck]]s, [[liquid cargo barge]]s, or ocean-going [[oil tanker]]s. These do not necessarily require the bitumen be blended with diluent since the tanks can be heated to allow the oil to be pumped out.\n\nThe demand for condensate for oil sands diluent is expected to be more than {{convert|750000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about {{convert|150000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US [[tight oil]] production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport {{convert|95000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and [[Enbridge]] is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships {{convert|180000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://calgaryherald.com/business/Bitumen+diluent+demand+expected+double+2020/9696681/story.html| title = Bitumen diluent demand expected to double by 2020| last = Healing| first = Dan| date = 3 April 2014| website = calgaryherald.com| publisher = Calgary Herald| accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref>\n\n===Venezuela===\nAlthough Venezuelan extra-heavy oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of the difference is due to temperature. Once the oil comes out of the ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of {{convert|630000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of [[naphtha]] to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much [[natural gas condensate]] from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US [[shale gas]] production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems \u2013 as a result of the country's [[2013-17 Venezuelan crisis|economic crisis]] -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://blogs.platts.com/2013/11/25/pdvsa-woes/| title = At the Wellhead: Venezuela's upgraders are maxed out to handle its heavy oil| website = platts.com| publisher =  Platts, McGraw Hill Financial| accessdate = 2014-05-06}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n{{See also|Oil pipeline}}\n\nA network of gathering and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: [[Edmonton, Alberta]] and [[Hardisty, Alberta]].

As a result, Enbridge implemented [[Rationing|pipeline apportionment]] on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space by reducing the monthly allocation of each shipper to a certain percentage of its requirements. The [[Chevron Corporation]] [[Burnaby Refinery]], the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate [[NAFTA]] equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota [[tight oil]] production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n\nIn addition, the US oil marketing hub at Cushing was flooded with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to take it from there to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of [[West Texas Intermediate]] delivered at Cushing, which is the main [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as [[Brent Crude]] and [[Dubai Crude]]. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as ''the price of oil'', this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast.\n\n===New pipelines===\nLack of access to markets, limited export capacity, and oversupply in the US market have been a problem for oil sands producers in recent years. They have caused lower prices to Canadian oil sands producers and reduced royalty and tax revenues to Canadian governments. The pipeline companies have moved forward with a number of solutions to the transportation problems:<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n* Enbridge's line from [[Sarnia, Ontario]] to Westover, Ontario near the head of [[Lake Erie]] has been reversed. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in the Sarnia area. Now it takes Alberta SCO and blended bitumen to most refineries in Ontario.\n* Enbridge has applied to reverse its line from Westover to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in southern Ontario. After reversal, it will take Alberta SCO and bitumen to Montreal. Since [[Suncor Energy]] owns a very large oil sands mine and upgrader in Alberta and also owns a large oil refinery in Montreal, it finds this project appealing. The alternative is closing the refinery since it is noncompetitive using offshore oil.\n*TransCanada is evaluating converting part of its mainline natural gas transmission system from western Canada to eastern North America to transport oil. Eastern North America is well supplied with natural gas as a result of the recent increases in US [[shale gas]] production, but has problems with oil supply since most of their oil comes from offshore.\n*Enbridge's [[Seaway Pipeline]] which used to take oil from the US Gulf Coast to the oil trading hub at Cushing was reversed in 2012 to take oil from Cushing to the Coast, helping to alleviate the bottleneck at Cushing. It has a capacity of {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} but Enbridge is twinning the pipeline to add an additional {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.\n*Following the denial of a US regulatory permit for its [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone XL pipeline]], TransCanada went ahead with the southern leg of the Keystone project. This will deliver {{convert|830000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} from Cushing to the Coast. Since it is entirely within the states of Oklahoma and Texas, it does not require US federal government approval.\n\n===Future pipelines===\nWith the main constraint on Canadian oil sands development becoming the availability of export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed a number of major new transmission pipelines. Many of these became stalled in government regulatory processes, both by the Canadian and American governments. Another factor is competition for pipeline space from rapidly increasing [[tight oil]] production from North Dakota, which under NAFTA trade rules has equal access to Canadian pipelines.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n* Enbridge has announced its intention to expand its Alberta Clipper line from {{convert|450000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|570000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} and its Southern Access line from {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|560000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. It is also proposing to build a Flanagan South line with an initial capacity of {{convert|585000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} expandable to {{convert|800000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}.\n* Enbridge is proposing to build the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway Pipeline]] from [[Bruderheim]], near [[Edmonton, Alberta]] to the port of [[Kitimat, BC]] for loading on [[supertanker]]s with an initial capacity of {{convert|525000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} with a reverse flow condensate pipeline to take diluent from tankers at Kitimat to Alberta. This was approved by the Canadian federal cabinet on 17 June 2014, subject to 209 conditions. After this point, the company has to satisfy most of the conditions to [[National Energy Board]] satisfaction before construction can start. Satisfying the conditions is expected to take a year or more. The leaders of both main opposition parties promised to reverse the decision if they form the government in the 2015 election.<ref name=Payton>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/northern-gateway-pipeline-approved-with-209-conditions-1.2678285| title = Northern Gateway pipeline approved with 209 conditions| last1 = Payton| first1 = Laura| last2 = Mas| first2 = Susana| date = 17 June 2014| website = cbc.ca/news| publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| accessdate = 2014-06-18}}</ref> This in fact occurred, as the [[Liberal party of Canada|Liberal party]] under [[Justin Trudeau]] won a majority government.<ref name=election>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-results-federal-election-2015-1.3278830| title = Stunning Liberal gains in Quebec as Trudeau wins majority government| date = 19 October 2015| website = cbc.ca/news| publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| accessdate = 6 November 2015}}</ref>\n* Kinder Morgan is proposing to increase the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline through British Columbia to {{convert|900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2017.

On 6 November 2015, American president [[Barack Obama]] announced that the State Department had rejected the proposed expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/06/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline|title = Statement by the President on the Keystone XL Pipeline|last = Obama|first = Barack|date = 6 November 2015|website = www.whitehouse.gov|publisher = The White House|accessdate = 7 November 2015}}</ref>\n* TransCanada has also proposed to build the {{convert|4600|km|abbr=on}} Energy East Pipeline, which would carry {{convert|1.1|e6oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of oil from Alberta to refineries in Eastern Canada, including Quebec and New Brunswick. It would also have marine facilities that would enable Alberta production to be delivered to Atlantic markets by oil tanker.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.transcanada.com/energy-east-pipeline.html| title = Energy East Pipeline Project| year = 2014| website = energyeastpipeline.com| publisher = TransCanada Pipelines Limited| accessdate = 2014-04-25}}</ref> The [[Irving Oil Refinery]] in New Brunswick, which is the largest oil refinery in Canada, is especially interested in it since its traditional sources such as [[North Sea oil]] are shrinking and international oil is more expensive than Alberta oil delivered to the Atlantic coast.\n \nIn addition, there are a large number of new pipelines proposed for Alberta. These will likely be approved rapidly by the Alberta Energy Regulator, so there are likely to be few capacity problems within Alberta.\n\n===Rail===\nThe movement of crude oil by rail is far from new, but it is now a rapidly growing market for [[Railroad classes|North American railroads]]. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.<ref name=\"Cairns 2013\"/>\n\nA single-track rail line carrying 10 trains per day, each with 120 tank cars, can move {{convert|630000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to {{convert|780000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}, which is the capacity of a large transmission pipeline. This would require 300 locomotives and 18,000 tank cars, which is a small part of the fleet of a Class 1 railroad. By comparison, the two Canadian Class 1 railways, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP) and [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN), have 2,400 locomotives and 65,000 freight cars between them, and CP moves 30\u201335 trains per day on its main line to Vancouver. Two US Class 1 railways, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP) and [[BNSF Railway]] handle more than 100 trains per day on their western corridors.<ref name=\"Cairns 2013\"/> CN Rail has said that it could move {{convert|1500000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen from Edmonton to the deepwater port of [[Prince Rupert, BC]] if the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Edmonton to the port of [[Kitimat, BC]] was not approved.\n\nWith many of their lines being underused, railroads find transporting crude oil an attractive source of revenue. With enough new tank cars they could carry all the new oil being produced in North America, albeit at higher prices than pipelines. In the short term, the use of rail will probably continue to grow as producers try to bypass short-term pipeline bottlenecks to take advantage of higher prices in areas with refineries capable of handling heavier crudes. In the long term the growth in rail transport will largely depend on the continued pipeline bottlenecks due to increased production in North America and regulatory delays for new pipelines. At present rail moves over {{convert|90000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude oil, and with continued growth in oil production and building of new terminals, rail movements will probably continue to grow into the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\"/>\n\nBy 2013, exports of oil from Canada to the US by rail had increased 9-fold in less than two years, from {{convert|16000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in early 2012 to {{convert|146000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} in late 2013, mainly because new export pipelines had been held up by regulatory delays. As a result, Canadian farmers suffered an acute shortage of rail capacity to export their grains because so much of Canada's rail capacity was tied up by oil products. The safety of rail transport of oil was being called into question after several derailments, especially after a train with 74 tank cars of oil derailed and caught fire in [[Lac Megantic, Quebec]].<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crude-by-rail-shipments-increase-9-fold-since-2012-1.2633280| title = Crude by rail shipments increase 9-fold since 2012| date = 6 May 2014 | website = cbc.ca/news| publisher = CBC News| accessdate = 2014-05-06}}</ref>\n{{See also|Lac-Megantic derailment}}\nThe ensuing explosion and firestorm burned down 40 buildings in the town center and killed 47 people. The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings may need to be demolished. Ironically, the oil was not Canadian bitumen being exported to the United States but [[Bakken formation]] [[light crude oil]] being imported into Canada from [[North Dakota]] to the [[Irving Oil Refinery]] in [[New Brunswick]]. Although near [[Canaport|a huge oil import port]] on the Atlantic Ocean, the Irving refinery is importing US Bakken oil by rail because oil from outside North America is too expensive to be economic, and there are no pipelines to deliver heavier but cheaper Western Canadian oil to New Brunswick. It was subsequently pointed out that the Bakken light oil was much more flammable than Alberta bitumen, and the rail cars were mislabeled by the North Dakota producers as to their flammability.\n\nBy 2014, the movement of crude by rail had become very profitable to oil companies. [[Suncor Energy]], Canada's largest oil company declared record profits and attributed much of it to transporting oil to market by rail. It was moving about {{convert|70000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} to [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], and putting it into TransCanada's new Gulf Coast pipeline \u2013 which was originally going to be the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, before the northern leg across the border from Canada was stalled by US federal government delays.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/suncor-profit-soars-on-oil-prices-weak-loonie/article18319278/#dashboard/follows/| title = Suncor kicks off strong earnings season for energy sector| last = Cryderman| first = Kelly| date = 29 April 2014| website = theglobeandmail.com| publisher = Toronto Globe and Mail| accessdate = 2014-04-29}}</ref>\n\nSuncor has also been moving {{convert|20000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of Alberta bitumen and North Dakota tight oil by rail to its [[Montreal Refinery]] with plans to increase it to {{convert|35000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}. Suncor claimed this saved about $10/bbl off the price of buying offshore oil. However, it was also anticipating the reversal of [[Enbridge]]'s Line 9 from southwestern Ontario to Montreal to deliver {{convert|300000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} oil even cheaper. Suncor has been considering adding a coker to its Montreal refinery to upgrade heavy oil sands bitumen, which would be cheaper than adding another upgrader to its oil sands operation. It was also shipping marine cargoes on an \"opportunistic basis\" from Texas and Louisiana \"at significant discounts to the international crudes we would typically run in Montreal\", thereby taking advantage of the recent US [[tight oil]] glut in addition to increased supplies of cheap Canadian oil sands bitumen.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/suncor-profit-soars-on-oil-prices-weak-loonie/article18319278/#dashboard/follows/| title = Lower-cost oil arriving at Suncor Montreal refinery by train, tanker| last = Krugel| first = Lauren| date = 4 February 2014| website = theglobeandmail.com| publisher = Toronto Globe and Mail| accessdate = 2014-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==Refining==\n{{See also|oil refinery}}\n\nHeavy [[crude oil feedstock#crude feedstock]] needs pre-processing before it is fit for conventional refineries, although heavy oil and bitumen refineries can do the pre-processing themselves. This pre-processing is called 'upgrading', the key components of which are as follows:\n# removal of water, sand, physical waste, and lighter products\n# catalytic purification by [[hydrodemetallisation]] (HDM), [[hydrodesulfurization]] (HDS) and [[hydrodenitrogenation]] (HDN)\n# hydrogenation through carbon rejection or [[catalytic hydrocracking]] (HCR)\n\nAs carbon rejection is very inefficient and wasteful in most cases, [[catalytic hydrocracking]] is preferred in most cases. All these processes take large amounts of energy and water, while emitting more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.\n\nCatalytic purification and hydrocracking are together known as [[hydroprocessing]]. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is to deal with the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time. Many efforts have been made to deal with this to ensure high activity and long life of a catalyst. Catalyst materials and pore size distributions are key parameters that need to be optimized to deal with this challenge and varies from place to place, depending on the kind of feedstock present.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ancheyta Jorge |author2=Rana Mohan S. |author3=Furimsky Edward |title=Hydroprocessing of heavy petroleum feeds: Tutorial |journal=Catalysis Today |issn=0920-5861 |volume=109 |issue=1\u20134 |date=30 November 2005 |pages=3\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2005.08.025}}</ref>\n\n===Alberta===\n{{See also|List of oil refineries#Alberta}}\n\nThere are four major [[oil refineries]] in Alberta which supply most of [[Western Canada]] with [[petroleum products]], but as of 2012 these processed less than 1/4 of the approximately {{convert|1900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen and SCO produced in Alberta.

Since the 1970s, the number of oil refineries in Canada has declined from 40 to 19. There hasn't been a new oil refinery (other than oil sands upgraders) built in Canada since 1984.\n\nMost of the Canadian oil refining industry is foreign-owned, and except for Alberta, international companies preferred to build refining capacity elsewhere than in Canada. The result is a serious imbalance between Canadian oil production versus Canadian oil refining. Although Canada produces much more oil than it refines, and exports more oil and refined products than it consumes, most of the new production is heavier than traditional oil and concentrated in the [[landlocked]] provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Canadian refineries have pipeline access to and can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada. The remainder of Canadian oil production is exported, almost all of it to the US. At the same time Canada imports {{convert|700000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of crude oil from other countries and exports much of the oil products to other countries, most of it to the US.<ref name=\"Mendelson\">{{cite web| url = http://science.ucalgary.ca/iseee/news/why-arent-we-building-refineries-canada-because-its-too-late-experts-say| title = Why Aren't We Building Refineries in Canada?

With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of [[Quebec]], the [[Atlantic Provinces]], and [[British Columbia]] where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel.<ref name=\"Mendelson\"/>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of oil refineries#United States|North American energy independence|Western Canadian Select}}\nPrior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was the largest oil importer in the world.<ref>{{cite news|title=China overtakes US as the biggest importer of oil|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475934|accessdate=2014-05-11|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 October 2013}}</ref> Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, many of which have been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined.

Export pipeline capacity is approaching its limits; Canadian oil is selling at a discount to world market prices; US demand for crude oil and product imports has declined because of US economic problems; and US oil domestic unconventional oil production (shale oil production from [[fracking]] is growing rapidly.  The US resumed export of crude oil in 2016; as of early 2019, the US produced as much oil as it consumed, with shale oil displacing Canadian imports.\n\nFor the benefit of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian producers created a new [[benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] called [[Western Canadian Select]], (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy crude oils. This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19\u201321 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as \"conventional heavy oil\" by governments. There are several hundred thousand barrels per day of this blend being imported into the US, in addition to larger amounts of crude bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO) from the oil sands.\n\nThe demand from US refineries is increasingly for non-upgraded bitumen rather than SCO. The Canadian [[National Energy Board]] (NEB) expects SCO volumes to double to around {{convert|1900000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} by 2035, but not keep pace with the total increase in bitumen production. It projects that the portion of oil sands production that is upgraded to SCO to decline from 49% in 2010 to 37% in 2035. This implies that over {{convert|3200000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} of bitumen will have to be blended with diluent for delivery to market.\n\n{{See also | Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts}}\n\n===Asia===\n{{See also|Petroleum industry in China}}\nDemand for oil in Asia has been growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China replaced the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production.

Canada has vast energy resources of all types and its oil and natural gas resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant [[hydroelectric]] resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. \n\nThe [[National Energy Board]] (NEB) reported in 2013, that if oil prices are above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs. The excess oil production from the oil sands could be exported. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.<ref name=\"NEB2013\">{{cite web| url = http://www.neb-one.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rnrgynfmtn/nrgyrprt/nrgyftr/2013/nrgftr2013-eng.html#s5| title = Canada's Energy Future 2013 \u2013 Energy Supply and Demand Projections to 2035 \u2013 An Energy Market Assessment| date = November 2013| website = neb-one.gc.ca| publisher = National Energy Board of Canada (NEB)| accessdate = 2014-04-20}}</ref>\n\nCanada has abundant resources of bitumen and crude oil, with an estimated remaining ultimate resource potential of 54 billion cubic metres (340 billion barrels). Of this, oil sands bitumen accounts for 90 per cent. Alberta currently accounts for all of Canada's bitumen resources. \"Resources\" become \"reserves\" only after it is proven that economic recovery can be achieved. At 2013 prices using current technology, Canada had remaining oil reserves of 27 billion m<sup>3</sup> (170 billion bbls), with 98% of this attributed to oil sands bitumen. This put its reserves in third place in the world behind [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].  At the much lower prices of 2015, the reserves are much smaller.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Costs===\nThe costs of production and transportation of saleable petroleum from oil sands is typically significantly higher than from conventional global sources.<ref name=CERI2015/><ref name=CERI-June2015/> Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable to the [[price of oil]]. The price of [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]] above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production. Major Canadian oil companies had announced expansion plans and foreign companies were investing significant amounts of capital, in many cases forming partnerships with Canadian companies. Investment had been shifting towards [[in-situ]] [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) projects and away from mining and upgrading projects, as oil sands operators foresee better opportunities from selling bitumen and heavy oil directly to refineries than from upgrading it to [[synthetic crude oil]]. [[Cost estimates]] for Canada include the effects of the mining when the mines are returned to the environment in \"as good as or better than original condition\". Cleanup of the end products of consumption are the responsibility of the consuming jurisdictions, which are mostly in provinces or countries other than the producing one.\n\nThe Alberta government estimated that in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas the cost of new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel.<ref name=\"ST98-2013\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aer.ca/documents/sts/ST98/ST98-2013.pdf | title =  ST98-2013: Alberta's Energy Reserves 2012 and Supply/Demand Outlook 2013\u20132022 | publisher = Alberta Energy Regulator | date = May 2013 | accessdate = 2015-04-23}}</ref> These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors.

The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil without upgrading.\n\nThe [[Canadian Energy Research Institute]] (CERI) performed an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl.<ref name=CERI2012>{{cite web| url = http://www.ceri.ca/images/stories/2013-06-10_CERI_Study_133_-_Oil_Sands_Update_2012-2046.pdf| title = Canadian Oil Sands Supply Costs and Development Projects (2012\u20132046) | last1 = Millington| first1 = Dinara| last2 =  Murillo |first2 =  Carlos A.| date = May 2013| website = ceri.ca| publisher = [[Canadian Energy Research Institute]]| accessdate = 2014-04-24}}</ref> Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were expected to be consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred to spend that extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil.\n\nThen in late 2014 the dramatic rise in U.S. production from shale formations, combined with a global economic malaise that reduced demand, caused the price of WTI to drop below $50, where it remained as of late 2015.<ref name=Pope>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-08/why-you-should-short-public-oil-companies|title= Why You Should Short Public Oil Companies | last=Pope | first = Carl | work= [[Bloomberg News]] |publisher= [[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date= 8 July 2015|accessdate=6 November 2015 }}</ref> \nIn 2015, the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) re-estimated the average plant gate costs (again including 10% profit margin) of SAGD to be $58.65/bbl, and 70.18/bbl for mining without upgrading.

Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m<sup>3</sup>/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth would likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods.\n\nAn additional assumption is that there would be sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this were a limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another assumption is that US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of [[tight oil]] production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on [[United States energy independence|imported crude]]. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] rejected the proposal to build the [[Keystone XL pipeline]] from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska.<ref name=NoKeystone>{{cite news|last=Koring |first= Paul|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/obama-to-reject-transcanadas-keystone-xl-pipeline-source-says/article27144973/|title=Obama rejects TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=6 November 2015|accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref> \nIn the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river barge, tanker, and other transportation methods.

In the absence of other constraints on further development, the oil and gas industry would need to fill tens of thousands of job openings in the next few years as a result of industry activity levels as well as age-related attrition. In the longer term, under a scenario of higher oil and gas prices, the labor shortages would continue to get worse. A potential labor shortage can increase construction costs and slow the pace of oil sands development.<ref name=\"NEB2013\"/>\n\nThe skilled worker shortage was much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company [[PDVSA]] fired most of its heavy oil experts after the [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002\u201303]], and wound down the production of [[Orimulsion]], which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry|re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry]] and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.\n\nAs of late 2015, development of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations.<ref name=Penty/> Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the [[European Community]] and China.

The title comes from a phrase coined by [[Manowar]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nOriginally known as ''Odds and Ends'', the album was first mentioned by guitarist [[Brian Bell]] during the summer of 2008. Vocalist and guitarist [[Rivers Cuomo]] states that the tracks are \"great songs, great recordings, but for some reason they didn't make the final cut for a record. And like the ''[[Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo|Alone]]'' record, they span a vast period of time from the very beginning of our career in the early '90s right up to the present day.\"\n\nFrontman [[Rivers Cuomo]] considers ''Death to False Metal'' to be Weezer's ninth studio album.

The title comes from a phrase coined by [[Manowar]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nOriginally known as ''Odds and Ends'', the album was first mentioned by guitarist [[Brian Bell]] during the summer of 2008. Vocalist and guitarist [[Rivers Cuomo]] states that the tracks are \"great songs, great recordings, but for some reason they didn't make the final cut for a record. And like the ''[[Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo|Alone]]'' record, they span a vast period of time from the very beginning of our career in the early '90s right up to the present day.\"\n\nFrontman [[Rivers Cuomo]] considers ''Death to False Metal'' to be Weezer's ninth studio album. Band webmaster and historian Karl Koch describes the release differently as \"a special album, [...] sort of like Weezer's version of Rivers' ''[[Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo|Alone]]'' records.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weezer.com/profiles/blogs/20101012-death-to-false-metal |title=2010/10/12 Death To False Metal! |publisher=Weezer |date=2010-10-12 |accessdate=2011-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718233445/http://weezer.com/profiles/blogs/20101012-death-to-false-metal |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nThe version of \"Mykel & Carli\" on the iTunes version of the album differs from the previously released version on the \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\" single in 1994 and later the deluxe edition of the band's [[Weezer (The Blue Album)|self-titled 1994 debut]].

Although it is situated in an industrial part of the Czech Republic there is no major industry within the city and people usually work in offices or have to commute. There are two large power plants nearby (Tu\u0161imice and Prun\u00e9\u0159ov). Kada\u0148 is a tourist centre with highlights being the Franciscan Monastery and the historical square with late Gothic Town Hall Tower. It is also a town with the narrowest lane in the Czech Republic - Katova uli\u010dka with only 66.1&nbsp;cm.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history until the Thirty Years' War ===\nThere are legends accrediting the beginnings of the town to [[Celt]]ic tribes. In the 1st century A.D. Germanic tribes came, but moved on in the great Germanic migration to the west. In the 6th century the country was settled by Slavs. Some talk about a castle on ''\u00daho\u0161\u0165'' hill that might have been called [[Battle of Wogastisburg|Wogastisburg]] where a battle between [[Franks]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] occurred in 631. The battle of [[Canburg]] in 805 is also often mentioned in connection with the town, but is a mistake because locality of this name (Canburg - Kanina) is in Middle Bohemia.\n\nThe first written record is, though, of the end of the 12th century - the Czech prince granted the \"market town\" of Kada\u0148 to the [[Knights of St. John]]. Slavic rulers called German settlers into the country, offering them freedom but gaining taxes at the same time. The Knights Hospitaller built the first church in Kada\u0148 - [[St. John the Baptist]] - which still stands in the part of town called Hospitaller Suburb, but is now in the [[Baroque]] style. In the 13th century, the town was promoted to a \"Royal City\". It began to thrive and a new town was built on the heights above the river, with a castle and [[Franciscan Monastery in Kada\u0148|Franciscan monastery]]. There was a big fire in 1362. However, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] who twice visited the city (1367 and 1374) granted it several municipal rights (home rule, a vineyard, and an annual market) that made it flourish again. The reign of [[Wenceslaus IV]] (V\u00e1clav IV) produced the skilled clockmaker [[Mikul\u00e1\u0161 of Kada\u0148]] (''Mikul\u00e1\u0161 z Kadan\u011b''), who, together with mathematician and astronomer [[Jan Sindel|Jan \u0160indel]], designed the [[Prague Orloj]].\n\nThe 15th century brought a new dimension to the history of Kada\u0148: the town and castle often used to be pledged to royal creditors. At the end of the rule of [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]] first the town and later the castle was captured by [[Jan Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (John of Lobkowicz and Hassenstein), who seemed to see Kada\u0148 as a suitable capital for his dependent territories. The establishment and construction of the monastery of the [[Franciscans]] of strict observance, built as a family burial-place and later a pardon place of [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]], may reflect his ambitions for the town. Jan Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd died in 1517 and is buried in the Church of Fourteen Holy Helpers. His tomb is still on display in the Church, now part of the municipal museum. The same year saw the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Germany, which had an immediate impact on the atmosphere in German speaking Kada\u0148. In 1534, \"Kada\u0148 religious peace\" was negotiated here between [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] Protestants and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] for the Catholic side. In the [[Thirty Years' War]] during the next century, Kada\u0148 suffered from fires and plundering by various armies on their way to the battlefields of [[Bohemia]]. After the war, the formerly Czech-German town became a monolingual German domain.\n\n=== The Age of Enlightenment until the 19th century ===\n[[File:Kadan river.jpg|thumb|right|Kada\u0148 seen from the river]]\n\nDuring the [[Silesian Wars]] Kada\u0148 was a foothold for the withdrawing French army that fortified in the Franciscan monastery and was besieged by Hungarian and Croatian units of the Austrian army. The door of the monastery church still shows the bullet holes from that battle on October 14, 1742. The town caught fire in 1746, providing a great opportunity for Kada\u0148's \"Christopher Wren\" - ''Johann Christoph Kosch''. He built many Baroque buildings, including the Church of the [[Elevation of the Holy Cross]], the Church of the Holy Family and the monastery of the [[Order of St. Elisabeth]]. The Castle of Kada\u0148 was rebuilt to serve as a barracks in the time of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. Her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] visited Kada\u0148 in 1779. Joseph's reforms also affected town life. The monastery of [[Minorites]] was closed and thereafter became the premises of the first Grammar School under control of the [[Piarists]] from 1803 to 1823. 1788 saw the inauguration of the town municipal council. [[Jakob Marzel Sternberger]] was its first Mayor and held office until 1822. His great-grandson [[Jacob Sternberger]] emigrated to the United States in 1850 as part of the first wave of European immigrants of that time ([[Max Kade]] Institute).\n\nThe last great fire damaged the town in 1811 and since then, the historic centre has retained its pattern. After the [[Revolution of 1848]] the letdown town became a district centre. The institute of the district town lasted in Kada\u0148 for 110 years when it was affiliated with [[Chomutov]] district. In the second half of the 19th century homeland study activities developed and a number of institutions, clubs and societies were established. The national composition of the Kada\u0148 population was very explicit - over 90% German and only 3% Czech, with a Jewish community as well.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nAt the start of the 20th century, the \"Society of Friends of the Museum in Kaaden\" decided to document the towns' history by opening a museum.\n\nIn the final weeks of [[World War I]], [[Czechoslovakia]] was established on 28 October 1918, its Bohemian, Moravian and Silesian component having been defined by the historic borders of the Czech (Bohemian) kingdom. However, most of the German border population, was not enthusiastic about becoming part of a new republic with a clearly Slavonic definition. Instead, four regional self-governed states emerged along the borderland, Kada\u0148  declared itself part of [[German Bohemia]]. On 4 March 1919, the first assembly of the Austria parliament. This was the occasion for both peaceful and violent demonstrations in the mostly German-populated border cities. In Kada\u0148, the curfew and martial law was declared and the Czechoslovak military forces were sent in. The demonstration in Kada\u0148 for [[self determination]] was the bloodiest. According to Swiss [[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]] report of 7 March 1919, 17 persons were killed, 30 badly wounded, and 80 wounded there. Over all, 25 victims were buried in a memorial grave at the central cemetery. It was restored after the fall of communism in 1989.\n\nAfter the [[Munich Agreement]] in later September 1938, Kaaden became part of Reichsgau [[Sudetenland]]. The local Czech people were forced to move to central Czechoslovakia, the remaining ones and the Jewish community was strongly oppressed. The synagogue was burnt down during the [[Kristallnacht]] of November 9, 1939. According to [[Bene\u0161 decrees]], after the [[Second World War]], all of the German population was transferred ([[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia during and after World War II]]), and the area was re-settled by Czech people, many without roots in this region.\n\n[[File:Prefab.jpg|thumb|left|165px|A prefabricated house after reconstruction]]\nFrom the 1950s, new prefabricated housing estates were built that reached the outer parts of the historical conurbation in the 1960s and 70s. This expansion was necessary because many people had moved in to get jobs in the region's thriving mining and electrical industries. The historical monuments were dilapidated and uncared-for. Before 1989 some parts of the historical centre were intended to be replaced by modern housing. Fortunately the [[Velvet Revolution]] changed the trend of development in the town and brought about a change in attitudes towards the cultural values of the past. The historical heart of Kada\u0148 began to be repaired and after 15 years it has become a pearl of the region. There is now a new site on the bank of the Oh\u0159e River being planned and projected- [[Maxipes F\u00edk]] Embankment with a lot of attractions both for children and adults. The town has been turning to be a tourist centre of the predominantly industrial region. The only drawback for tourism is the lack of a higher-capacity hotel in the town.\n\n== Places of interest ==\n* [[Franciscan Monastery in Kada\u0148|Franciscan Monastery]] (museum)\n* Town Hall Tower\n* The Castle\n* The Old Square\n* Holy Tower\n* Barbican\n* Lookout Tower on Svat\u00fd kope\u010dek (Holy Hill)\n\n== Galleries ==\n[[File:Galerie Kisza.jpg|thumb|80px|left|U netop\u00fdra]]\n* \n* M\u011bstsk\u00e1 galerie Josefa Lieslera (\"pod v\u011b\u017e\u00ed\" - ''under the tower'')\n* M\u011bstsk\u00e1 galerie Karla Havl\u00ed\u010dka (\"na hrad\u011b\" - ''in the castle'')\n* Galerie U Netop\u00fdra also called Kisza Gallery, is one of the largest private galleries with permanent exhibition in Central Europe\n* Galerie U Adama (Jitka Gavendov\u00e1 and Franti\u0161ek Vl\u010dek)\n* Galerie Na p\u016fd\u011b - \"on the attic\" (of the Franciscan Monastery)\n* Pictures and photographs for sale are usually in a lot of local restaurants and boarding houses\n\n== Annual events ==\n* Emperor's Day (on last August Sunday, takes place on the square with a lot of attractions)\n* [[Maxipes Fik|Maxipes F\u00edk]] Birthday\n* [[Wenceslas Pantaleon Kirwitzer|Kirwitzer]] Astronomical Day\n* Old Czech Carnival\n* Franciscan Summer\n* Vine Harvest Festival\n* ''Vysm\u00e1t\u00e9 l\u00e9to'' - Summer Rock Fest\n* Nativity Play\n* Passion of Christ Play\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:Zemedelska skola.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Agricultural School]][[File:Gymnasium in Kada\u0148.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Gymnasium]][[File:Prumyslova skola.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Industrial School]]\n\nKada\u0148 is home to several secondary schools with a long history.\nThe oldest of them is the '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' that was established in 1803 with 99 students and continued under the control of the [[Piarists]] until 1823. The seat of the old '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was a former [[Minorites]] Monastery (different from the Franciscan Monastery) near the square in a building which is now residence of the Regional Archives. The institute of '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was then reestablished in 1872 in a new building. The '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was again closed in 1951 and the new Industrial School moved to the building. It is still there today. A new '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was established in 1968 and has remained on the same premises since 1978. The Industrial School specialized at first on mining (because of the [[lignite]] and [[uranium]] mines in the surroundings), however since 1957 it has been specialized on building and finally in 2001 it added Commercial Academy to its educational program so now it is called '''Industrial Building School and Commercial Academy'''. The '''Agriculture School''' (now '''''SO\u0160S a SOU Amos''''') was established in 1862 as so-called ''Ackerbauschule''. In front of the building there are valuable statues of [[Albrecht Thaer|Albrecht Daniel Thaer]] and [[Justus von Liebig]] (restored in 2003). The teaching in all the schools was in German language until 1945. There are 4 Elementary Schools in Kada\u0148 and a school for handicapped children.\n\n==Notable people==\n===History===\n* [[Peter Georg Niger]] (Schwartz) (1434 - 1481 or 1484) - theologian\n* [[Jan Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (1450 - 1517) - traveller, politician and writer\n* Petr \u0160t\u011brba ze \u0160t\u011brbic (1517/18-1591) - scriber and translator\n* Jan Sandel - translator from German ([[Wenceslaus H\u00e1jek]]'s ''[[Bohemian Chronicle]]'', 1543)\n* [[Wenceslas Pantaleon Kirwitzer|Wenceslas (V\u00e1clav) Pantaleon Kirwitzer]] (1588 - 1626 [[Macau]]) - astronomer\n* [[Wilhelm Nigrinus]] (Schwartz) (1588 - 1638) ([[:de:Wilhelm Nigrinus]]), [[ethnologist]]\n* [[Theodor Innitzer]] (1875 - 1955) - [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]], [[Archbishop of Vienna]]\n* [[Hans Zeisel]] (1905 - 1992 [[Chicago]]), sociologist and economist\n* [[Petr Kl\u00edma]] (1964 born to Kada\u0148 parents in [[Chomutov]] hospital), ice hockey player, [[Stanley Cup]] winner (1990, [[Edmonton Oilers]])\n\n===Music===\n* [[Edward Goll]] (1884 - 1949, [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]), pianist and music teacher\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Liesler.jpg|thumb|150px|A Picture by J.

There were three major parks in the 19th century enlarging town. The Municipal park - now ''Smetanovy sady'' - was founded by a Kada\u0148 inhabitant and future Mayor Peter Prinzl in 1852. Landscape park was also established on the rocks over the Oh\u0159e river next to the Franciscan monastery. A new organisation ''Anpflanzungs- und Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Kaaden'' concentrated its energy on park layout for so-called ''Svat\u00e1 hora'' or ''Svat\u00fd kope\u010dek'' - ''Holy Hill'' that was called \"holy\" (''heiliger berg'' since 1541) for its position above the ''holy'' pilgrimage monastery. The hill with abandoned rock vineyards became an English park with a lot of viewpoints, arbours and benches at the turn of the 20th century. [[Jaroslav Havl\u00ed\u010dek]] wrote in his novel ''\"Vl\u010d\u00ed k\u016f\u017ee\"'' about Svat\u00e1 hora that it was a place for romantic walks of young couples. The park the area around was also referred to as ''Sommerfrische Kaaden'' - Kada\u0148 summer resort. It was, however, not cared for in the times of World War II and Communists after 1948 left the park to be completely devastated and overgrown.

Although it is situated in an industrial part of the Czech Republic there is no major industry within the city and people usually work in offices or have to commute. There are two large power plants nearby (Tu\u0161imice and Prun\u00e9\u0159ov). Kada\u0148 is a tourist centre with highlights being the Franciscan Monastery and the historical square with late Gothic Town Hall Tower. It is also a town with the narrowest lane in the Czech Republic - Katova uli\u010dka with only 66.1&nbsp;cm.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history until the Thirty Years' War ===\nThere are legends accrediting the beginnings of the town to [[Celt]]ic tribes. In the 1st century A.D. Germanic tribes came, but moved on in the great Germanic migration to the west. In the 6th century the country was settled by Slavs. Some talk about a castle on ''\u00daho\u0161\u0165'' hill that might have been called [[Battle of Wogastisburg|Wogastisburg]] where a battle between [[Franks]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] occurred in 631. The battle of [[Canburg]] in 805 is also often mentioned in connection with the town, but is a mistake because locality of this name (Canburg - Kanina) is in Middle Bohemia.\n\nThe first written record is, though, of the end of the 12th century - the Czech prince granted the \"market town\" of Kada\u0148 to the [[Knights of St. John]]. Slavic rulers called German settlers into the country, offering them freedom but gaining taxes at the same time. The Knights Hospitaller built the first church in Kada\u0148 - [[St. John the Baptist]] - which still stands in the part of town called Hospitaller Suburb, but is now in the [[Baroque]] style. In the 13th century, the town was promoted to a \"Royal City\". It began to thrive and a new town was built on the heights above the river, with a castle and [[Franciscan Monastery in Kada\u0148|Franciscan monastery]]. There was a big fire in 1362. However, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] who twice visited the city (1367 and 1374) granted it several municipal rights (home rule, a vineyard, and an annual market) that made it flourish again. The reign of [[Wenceslaus IV]] (V\u00e1clav IV) produced the skilled clockmaker [[Mikul\u00e1\u0161 of Kada\u0148]] (''Mikul\u00e1\u0161 z Kadan\u011b''), who, together with mathematician and astronomer [[Jan Sindel|Jan \u0160indel]], designed the [[Prague Orloj]].\n\nThe 15th century brought a new dimension to the history of Kada\u0148: the town and castle often used to be pledged to royal creditors. At the end of the rule of [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]] first the town and later the castle was captured by [[Jan Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (John of Lobkowicz and Hassenstein), who seemed to see Kada\u0148 as a suitable capital for his dependent territories. The establishment and construction of the monastery of the [[Franciscans]] of strict observance, built as a family burial-place and later a pardon place of [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]], may reflect his ambitions for the town. Jan Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd died in 1517 and is buried in the Church of Fourteen Holy Helpers. His tomb is still on display in the Church, now part of the municipal museum. The same year saw the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Germany, which had an immediate impact on the atmosphere in German speaking Kada\u0148. In 1534, \"Kada\u0148 religious peace\" was negotiated here between [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] Protestants and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] for the Catholic side. In the [[Thirty Years' War]] during the next century, Kada\u0148 suffered from fires and plundering by various armies on their way to the battlefields of [[Bohemia]]. After the war, the formerly Czech-German town became a monolingual German domain.\n\n=== The Age of Enlightenment until the 19th century ===\n[[File:Kadan river.jpg|thumb|right|Kada\u0148 seen from the river]]\n\nDuring the [[Silesian Wars]] Kada\u0148 was a foothold for the withdrawing French army that fortified in the Franciscan monastery and was besieged by Hungarian and Croatian units of the Austrian army. The door of the monastery church still shows the bullet holes from that battle on October 14, 1742. The town caught fire in 1746, providing a great opportunity for Kada\u0148's \"Christopher Wren\" - ''Johann Christoph Kosch''. He built many Baroque buildings, including the Church of the [[Elevation of the Holy Cross]], the Church of the Holy Family and the monastery of the [[Order of St. Elisabeth]]. The Castle of Kada\u0148 was rebuilt to serve as a barracks in the time of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. Her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] visited Kada\u0148 in 1779. Joseph's reforms also affected town life. The monastery of [[Minorites]] was closed and thereafter became the premises of the first Grammar School under control of the [[Piarists]] from 1803 to 1823. 1788 saw the inauguration of the town municipal council. [[Jakob Marzel Sternberger]] was its first Mayor and held office until 1822. His great-grandson [[Jacob Sternberger]] emigrated to the United States in 1850 as part of the first wave of European immigrants of that time ([[Max Kade]] Institute).\n\nThe last great fire damaged the town in 1811 and since then, the historic centre has retained its pattern. After the [[Revolution of 1848]] the letdown town became a district centre. The institute of the district town lasted in Kada\u0148 for 110 years when it was affiliated with [[Chomutov]] district. In the second half of the 19th century homeland study activities developed and a number of institutions, clubs and societies were established. The national composition of the Kada\u0148 population was very explicit - over 90% German and only 3% Czech, with a Jewish community as well.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nAt the start of the 20th century, the \"Society of Friends of the Museum in Kaaden\" decided to document the towns' history by opening a museum.\n\nIn the final weeks of [[World War I]], [[Czechoslovakia]] was established on 28 October 1918, its Bohemian, Moravian and Silesian component having been defined by the historic borders of the Czech (Bohemian) kingdom. However, most of the German border population, was not enthusiastic about becoming part of a new republic with a clearly Slavonic definition. Instead, four regional self-governed states emerged along the borderland, Kada\u0148  declared itself part of [[German Bohemia]]. On 4 March 1919, the first assembly of the Austria parliament. This was the occasion for both peaceful and violent demonstrations in the mostly German-populated border cities. In Kada\u0148, the curfew and martial law was declared and the Czechoslovak military forces were sent in. The demonstration in Kada\u0148 for [[self determination]] was the bloodiest. According to Swiss [[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]] report of 7 March 1919, 17 persons were killed, 30 badly wounded, and 80 wounded there. Over all, 25 victims were buried in a memorial grave at the central cemetery. It was restored after the fall of communism in 1989.\n\nAfter the [[Munich Agreement]] in later September 1938, Kaaden became part of Reichsgau [[Sudetenland]]. The local Czech people were forced to move to central Czechoslovakia, the remaining ones and the Jewish community was strongly oppressed. The synagogue was burnt down during the [[Kristallnacht]] of November 9, 1939. According to [[Bene\u0161 decrees]], after the [[Second World War]], all of the German population was transferred ([[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia during and after World War II]]), and the area was re-settled by Czech people, many without roots in this region.\n\n[[File:Prefab.jpg|thumb|left|165px|A prefabricated house after reconstruction]]\nFrom the 1950s, new prefabricated housing estates were built that reached the outer parts of the historical conurbation in the 1960s and 70s. This expansion was necessary because many people had moved in to get jobs in the region's thriving mining and electrical industries. The historical monuments were dilapidated and uncared-for. Before 1989 some parts of the historical centre were intended to be replaced by modern housing. Fortunately the [[Velvet Revolution]] changed the trend of development in the town and brought about a change in attitudes towards the cultural values of the past. The historical heart of Kada\u0148 began to be repaired and after 15 years it has become a pearl of the region. There is now a new site on the bank of the Oh\u0159e River being planned and projected- [[Maxipes F\u00edk]] Embankment with a lot of attractions both for children and adults. The town has been turning to be a tourist centre of the predominantly industrial region. The only drawback for tourism is the lack of a higher-capacity hotel in the town.\n\n== Places of interest ==\n* [[Franciscan Monastery in Kada\u0148|Franciscan Monastery]] (museum)\n* Town Hall Tower\n* The Castle\n* The Old Square\n* Holy Tower\n* Barbican\n* Lookout Tower on Svat\u00fd kope\u010dek (Holy Hill)\n\n== Galleries ==\n[[File:Galerie Kisza.jpg|thumb|80px|left|U netop\u00fdra]]\n* \n* M\u011bstsk\u00e1 galerie Josefa Lieslera (\"pod v\u011b\u017e\u00ed\" - ''under the tower'')\n* M\u011bstsk\u00e1 galerie Karla Havl\u00ed\u010dka (\"na hrad\u011b\" - ''in the castle'')\n* Galerie U Netop\u00fdra also called Kisza Gallery, is one of the largest private galleries with permanent exhibition in Central Europe\n* Galerie U Adama (Jitka Gavendov\u00e1 and Franti\u0161ek Vl\u010dek)\n* Galerie Na p\u016fd\u011b - \"on the attic\" (of the Franciscan Monastery)\n* Pictures and photographs for sale are usually in a lot of local restaurants and boarding houses\n\n== Annual events ==\n* Emperor's Day (on last August Sunday, takes place on the square with a lot of attractions)\n* [[Maxipes Fik|Maxipes F\u00edk]] Birthday\n* [[Wenceslas Pantaleon Kirwitzer|Kirwitzer]] Astronomical Day\n* Old Czech Carnival\n* Franciscan Summer\n* Vine Harvest Festival\n* ''Vysm\u00e1t\u00e9 l\u00e9to'' - Summer Rock Fest\n* Nativity Play\n* Passion of Christ Play\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:Zemedelska skola.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Agricultural School]][[File:Gymnasium in Kada\u0148.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Gymnasium]][[File:Prumyslova skola.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Industrial School]]\n\nKada\u0148 is home to several secondary schools with a long history.\nThe oldest of them is the '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' that was established in 1803 with 99 students and continued under the control of the [[Piarists]] until 1823. The seat of the old '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was a former [[Minorites]] Monastery (different from the Franciscan Monastery) near the square in a building which is now residence of the Regional Archives. The institute of '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was then reestablished in 1872 in a new building. The '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was again closed in 1951 and the new Industrial School moved to the building. It is still there today. A new '''[[Gymnasium Kada\u0148|Gymnasium]]''' was established in 1968 and has remained on the same premises since 1978. The Industrial School specialized at first on mining (because of the [[lignite]] and [[uranium]] mines in the surroundings), however since 1957 it has been specialized on building and finally in 2001 it added Commercial Academy to its educational program so now it is called '''Industrial Building School and Commercial Academy'''. The '''Agriculture School''' (now '''''SO\u0160S a SOU Amos''''') was established in 1862 as so-called ''Ackerbauschule''. In front of the building there are valuable statues of [[Albrecht Thaer|Albrecht Daniel Thaer]] and [[Justus von Liebig]] (restored in 2003). The teaching in all the schools was in German language until 1945. There are 4 Elementary Schools in Kada\u0148 and a school for handicapped children.\n\n==Notable people==\n===History===\n* [[Peter Georg Niger]] (Schwartz) (1434 - 1481 or 1484) - theologian\n* [[Jan Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (1450 - 1517) - traveller, politician and writer\n* Petr \u0160t\u011brba ze \u0160t\u011brbic (1517/18-1591) - scriber and translator\n* Jan Sandel - translator from German ([[Wenceslaus H\u00e1jek]]'s ''[[Bohemian Chronicle]]'', 1543)\n* [[Wenceslas Pantaleon Kirwitzer|Wenceslas (V\u00e1clav) Pantaleon Kirwitzer]] (1588 - 1626 [[Macau]]) - astronomer\n* [[Wilhelm Nigrinus]] (Schwartz) (1588 - 1638) ([[:de:Wilhelm Nigrinus]]), [[ethnologist]]\n* [[Theodor Innitzer]] (1875 - 1955) - [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]], [[Archbishop of Vienna]]\n* [[Hans Zeisel]] (1905 - 1992 [[Chicago]]), sociologist and economist\n* [[Petr Kl\u00edma]] (1964 born to Kada\u0148 parents in [[Chomutov]] hospital), ice hockey player, [[Stanley Cup]] winner (1990, [[Edmonton Oilers]])\n\n===Music===\n* [[Edward Goll]] (1884 - 1949, [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]), pianist and music teacher\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Liesler.jpg|thumb|150px|A Picture by J.

There were three major parks in the 19th century enlarging town. The Municipal park - now ''Smetanovy sady'' - was founded by a Kada\u0148 inhabitant and future Mayor Peter Prinzl in 1852. Landscape park was also established on the rocks over the Oh\u0159e river next to the Franciscan monastery. A new organisation ''Anpflanzungs- und Versch\u00f6nerungsverein Kaaden'' concentrated its energy on park layout for so-called ''Svat\u00e1 hora'' or ''Svat\u00fd kope\u010dek'' - ''Holy Hill'' that was called \"holy\" (''heiliger berg'' since 1541) for its position above the ''holy'' pilgrimage monastery. The hill with abandoned rock vineyards became an English park with a lot of viewpoints, arbours and benches at the turn of the 20th century. [[Jaroslav Havl\u00ed\u010dek]] wrote in his novel ''\"Vl\u010d\u00ed k\u016f\u017ee\"'' about Svat\u00e1 hora that it was a place for romantic walks of young couples. The park the area around was also referred to as ''Sommerfrische Kaaden'' - Kada\u0148 summer resort. It was, however, not cared for in the times of World War II and Communists after 1948 left the park to be completely devastated and overgrown. However, the socialist planners projected the new residential areas with a lot of greenery inside.

The serial involves the [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]) and his travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]), and [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]) allying themselves with the former inhabitants of the planet [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]], the Menoptra, as they struggle to win back Vortis from the malignant Animus.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=multiple|date=June 2017|\n{{long plot|date=June 2017|episodes}}\n}}\nAn unknown force pulls the [[TARDIS]] off course and forces it to land on an unidentified planet. Whilst exploring with [[Ian Chesterton|Ian]], the [[First Doctor]] recognises the planet as [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]]; however, the presence of several moons in the sky of the normally moonless planet puzzles him.\n\nInside the ship, an unknown force acting through [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]]'s gold bracelet draws her outside, leaving [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] alone. The TARDIS is then pulled by an unseen force across the planet's surface.\n\nIn her trance, Barbara walks into a trio of the butterfly-like Menoptra. They remove her bracelet, freeing her of the trance, then debate what to do with her. She escapes, but the Zarbi immediately capture her. Brainwashed through the use of a gold collar, the Zarbi use Barbara to find the Menoptra. The Zarbi take Barbara and the Menoptra called Hrostar to the Crater of Needles, where the Zarbi force them to gather vegetation and drop it into rivers of acid which feed the Animus.\n\nThe Zarbi capture the Doctor and Ian and take them to the Carsinome. There they find Vicki and the TARDIS. They also meet the Animus who forces the Doctor to help it track down the Menoptra invasion force. Ian escapes, whilst the Doctor and Vicki try to bide their time.\n[[File:Menoptra (28807516473).jpg|thumb|left|A Menoptra, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nIan meets with a Menoptra called Vrestin. He learns that the Menoptra were native to the planet Vortis along with the Zarbi, until a great evil force, the Animus, slowly and gradually took control of the planet through the Zarbi. By the time the Menoptra noticed the danger it was too late, and they had to flee the planet to one of the moons the Animus pulled into orbit around Vortis.\n\nBack in the Carsinome, the Doctor accidentally reveals that the Menoptra spearhead plans to land at a place near the Crater of Needles. The Animus uses this information to ambush them.\n\nThe Zarbi soon locate Ian and Vrestin, but they escape when they fall into a tunnel. Inside they meet the Optera, descendants of the Menoptra who fled the Animus underground. Ian and Vrestin convince the Optera to join them in fighting the Animus.\n\nAt the Crater of Needles, Barbara and Hrostar escape and try to meet up with the spearhead to warn them, but the spearhead is massacred.\n\nAt the Carsinome, the Doctor works out that the Animus uses gold as a conductor to channel its mesmerising force. He counteracts this force to control one of the Zarbi. The Doctor and Vicki escape. They meet up with Barbara and the Menoptra and devise a plan to attack the Carsinome.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki return to the Carsinome, where the Zarbi take them to the Animus, a great spider-like creature, which mesmerises them. Meanwhile, Barbara and the Menoptra launch their attack on the Carsinome from outside whilst Ian and Vrestin with the Optera reach the Animus from below. They eventually defeat the Animus with a bomb.\n\n==Production==\nThe story had the working title of ''The Webbed Planet''. Episode six was initially titled \"Centre of Terror\".

The serial involves the [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]) and his travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]), and [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]) allying themselves with the former inhabitants of the planet [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]], the Menoptra, as they struggle to win back Vortis from the malignant Animus.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=multiple|date=June 2017|\n{{long plot|date=June 2017|episodes}}\n}}\nAn unknown force pulls the [[TARDIS]] off course and forces it to land on an unknown planet. Whilst exploring with [[Ian Chesterton|Ian]], the [[First Doctor]] recognises the planet as [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]]; however, the presence of several moons in the sky of the normally moonless planet puzzles him.\n\nInside the ship, an unknown force acting through [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]]'s gold bracelet draws her outside, leaving [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] alone. The TARDIS is then pulled by an unseen force across the planet's surface.\n\nIn her trance, Barbara walks into a trio of the butterfly-like Menoptra. They remove her bracelet, freeing her of the trance, then debate what to do with her. She escapes, but the Zarbi immediately capture her. Brainwashed through the use of a gold collar, the Zarbi use Barbara to find the Menoptra. The Zarbi take Barbara and the Menoptra called Hrostar to the Crater of Needles, where the Zarbi force them to gather vegetation and drop it into rivers of acid which feed the Animus.\n\nThe Zarbi capture the Doctor and Ian and take them to the Carsinome. There they find Vicki and the TARDIS. They also meet the Animus who forces the Doctor to help it track down the Menoptra invasion force. Ian escapes, whilst the Doctor and Vicki try to bide their time.\n[[File:Menoptra (28807516473).jpg|thumb|left|A Menoptra, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nIan meets with a Menoptra called Vrestin. He learns that the Menoptra were native to the planet Vortis along with the Zarbi, until a great evil force, the Animus, slowly and gradually took control of the planet through the Zarbi. By the time the Menoptra noticed the danger it was too late, and they had to flee the planet to one of the moons the Animus pulled into orbit around Vortis.\n\nBack in the Carsinome, the Doctor accidentally reveals that the Menoptra spearhead plans to land at a place near the Crater of Needles. The Animus uses this information to ambush them.\n\nThe Zarbi soon locate Ian and Vrestin, but they escape when they fall into a tunnel. Inside they meet the Optera, descendants of the Menoptra who fled the Animus underground. Ian and Vrestin convince the Optera to join them in fighting the Animus.\n\nAt the Crater of Needles, Barbara and Hrostar escape and try to meet up with the spearhead to warn them, but the spearhead is massacred.\n\nAt the Carsinome, the Doctor works out that the Animus uses gold as a conductor to channel its mesmerising force. He counteracts this force to control one of the Zarbi. The Doctor and Vicki escape. They meet up with Barbara and the Menoptra and devise a plan to attack the Carsinome.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki return to the Carsinome, where the Zarbi take them to the Animus, a great spider-like creature, which mesmerises them. Meanwhile, Barbara and the Menoptra launch their attack on the Carsinome from outside whilst Ian and Vrestin with the Optera reach the Animus from below. They eventually defeat the Animus with a bomb.\n\n==Production==\nThe story had the working title of ''The Webbed Planet''. Episode six was initially titled \"Centre of Terror\".
