The 2010 season was the first under [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Alex Anthopoulos]], who replaced [[J. P. Ricciardi]] after the [[2009 Toronto Blue Jays season|2009 season]].\n\nAfter a poor 2009 season in which the Blue Jays finished with a 75\u201387 record, 2010 saw the team improve by 10 games, finishing with an 85\u201377 record and in fourth place in the [[American League East]]. Led by [[Jos\u00e9 Bautista]], whose 54 home runs set a [[List of Toronto Blue Jays team records|franchise record]] and led the Major Leagues, the team also set a franchise record with 257 home runs.\n\n== Offseason ==\n\n===\"The Doc Deal\"===\n\nOne of the biggest trades in Blue Jays history (known as \"The Doc Deal\") was executed on December 16, 2009, when the Blue Jays traded Roy Halladay and US$6&nbsp;million to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for [[Kyle Drabek]], [[Travis d'Arnaud]] and [[Michael Taylor (baseball, born 1985)|Michael Taylor]];<ref name=\"halladaytrade\">{{cite web| url = http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20091216&content_id=7817972| title = Blue Jays complete Halladay trade| publisher = MLB Advanced Media, L.P.| date = December 16, 2009| accessdate = March 11, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Taylor was then traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for [[Brett Wallace]].

It was a trade-filled offseason, including The Doc Deal, which landed the Jays three players for [[Roy Halladay]]. The Jays made five trades in total. The Jays traded cash considerations for two pitchers in separate deals, and traded a player to be named for Zach Jackson.

Alex Anthopolous made his first transaction ever when he picked up reliever [[Sean Henn]] from the Orioles in late October 2009. He acquired [[Jarrett Hoffpauir]] on November 3. Once free agency started to kick in, he claimed shortstop Mike McCoy from Colorado, and never made a transaction for the rest of 2009. Anthopolous made his first waiver claim of 2010 on January 7, when he claimed [[Brian Bocock]] from the San Francisco Giants. Bocock was waived and picked up by the Phillies on January 26.

[[Vernon Wells]] stated that \"Obviously, there are issues\". On the same topic, Wells was asked if he could play for the Jays next season, and he replied with \"I cannot answer that at this point in time\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torontosportsmedia.com/tag/vernon-wells |title=Vernon Wells|work=Toronto Sports Media Blog |date=October 31, 2009 |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref> One day later, Blue Jays General Manager [[J.

Ricciardi had received criticism for signing bulky, no-trade-clause contracts to players such as Vernon Wells, [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], [[Alex R\u00edos]] and [[B. J. Ryan]]; three of the four were eventually released. Problems were also raised with Ricciardi's drafts and scouting. He had drafted more than 200 players during his tenure, and had only six were the major league players at the time of his firing. One of his biggest failures was drafting [[Russ Adams]] 14th overall in the [[2002 Major League Baseball draft|2002 entry draft]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2009/10/03/ricciardi_moves_best_worst/ |title=The Best & Worst of J.

Some others criticized him for not drafting 30-home run slugger [[Troy Tulowitzki]]. Ricciardi made one of his biggest mistakes publicizing a trade for the face of the Blue Jays, [[Roy Halladay]]. In an interview on the [[CJCL|FAN 590]], he was asked if he was interested in trading Halladay, and he replied by saying \"We would not be doing our job if we did not entertain offers from other teams\". He went on to make numerous trade offers to the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] for top pitching prospects, primarily [[Kyle Drabek]], or [[J. A. Happ]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/jon_heyman/07/21/daily.scoop/index.html | work=CNN | title=Phillies won't give up Drabek for Halladay; Cliff Lee on the block? | accessdate=April 1, 2010 | date=July 21, 2009}}</ref> The Phillies stuck with reigning Cy Young winner Cliff Lee instead, closing any door on Halladay being traded. The Jays had just lost three of four in a crucial series in New York when the rumours started, and the Jays' season went downhill. Affected by the trade talks, the Jays went from seven games behind to 13, and the Rays surpassed the Jays for good during the slide. On October 30, [[Cito Gaston]] announced that he will retire after the 2010 season, but he signed a four-year consulting deal with the Jays for post-retirement. The Jays had two other members of the coaching staff leave; [[Brad Arnsberg]] left to be the Pitching Coach of the [[Houston Astros]], and hitting coach [[Gene Tenace]] also announced that he will retire, only he will not be present for the 2010 season. These moves resulted in former bullpen coach, [[Bruce Walton (baseball)|Bruce Walton]] becoming the pitching coach, and the former first base coach [[Dwayne Murphy]] took over at hitting coach. The two new coaches are [[Rick Langford]], who took the helm as Bullpen Coach, and [[Omar Malav\u00e9]] became the new first base coach. [[Brian Butterfield]] moved from first to third giving Malave room at first, and bumping [[Nick Leyva]] up to be the bench coach.\n\n=== Ownership ===\nAfter the death of Blue Jays owner [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]] following the 2008 season, speculation has also surrounded a potential change in team ownership. Home attendance reached its lowest since the 2003 season, and the Jays' management pursued attempts to shed payroll, including the releases of [[B. J. Ryan]] and [[Alex R\u00edos]] and the trade of [[Scott Rolen]] to the Cincinnati Reds. These moves spurred fans to speculate that Rogers Communications was attempting to make the franchise more attractive to potential buyers. On October 21, 2009, during an interview with radio station [[CJCL|Fan 590]], Tony Viner, the president and CEO of the company's media division that also controls the Blue Jays, stated emphatically that, \"the team is not for sale. We are committed to winning and to doing the things that it takes to win.\"<ref name=\"Blue Jays say yes to spending, no to selling\">{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=2130348 |title=National Post Story |work=National Post |location=Canada |accessdate=April 5, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n===2009===\n* '''September 15''': Blue Jays and the rest of the MLB release the 2010 schedule.<ref>{{cite web|author =Mark Newman |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090915&content_id=6975230 |title=MLB announces master 2010 schedule &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kansas City Royals John Buck.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]] signed December 13.]]\n[[File:Roy Halladay 2009 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[#\"The Doc Deal\"|The Doc Deal]] was pulled off December 14, 2009.]]\n[[File:001U3148 Marco Scutaro.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marco Scutaro]] signed a deal with the Boston Red Sox, thus rewarding the Jays with 2 compensation picks.]]\n* '''October 3''': [[J.

[[Chris Lubanski]], an offseason addition, hit the Jays only home run in that game when he hit a solo shot in the 8th. In total, 6 pitchers were sent out on day one, 5 of which were in their first spring training with the Jays. A day later, the Blue Jays got their first win, defeating Detroit 9\u20137. It was an interesting day as [[Kyle Drabek]] made his much anticipated debut for the Jays, and Halladay made his Debut with the Phillies. Halladay pitched 2 hitless innings, and Drabek pitched 2 innings giving up 2 runs on 3 hits. Drabek also struck out three. [[J. P. Arencibia]] hit a 2 run home run in the top of the 9th to break a 7\u20137 tie, and ultimately give the Jays a 9\u20137 win as [[Rommie Lewis]] closed the game out in the bottom of the ninth. The Jays played the Phillies a day later and beat them 14\u20139. The Jays once held a 14\u20132 lead at one point in that game. The Blue Jays won their third straight by smashing New York 9\u20131 at Legends Field. Shawn Marcum got the win in his first start with the Jays since 2008, and won their fourth straight over Detroit to improve their record to 4\u20131. Three of the four potential closers each pitched an inning giving up a combined 2 hits and 1 run with 2 strikeouts. [[Kevin Gregg]] gave up a home run to [[Gerald Laird]] in the 4th inning, and was the only one of three to not get a strikeout. On March 8, the Blue Jays cut their first three non-roster invites, two of them being catchers. Pitcher Daniel Farquhar was the first pitcher to be cut, and catchers Matt Luizza and [[Travis d'Arnaud]] (acquired in the Doc Deal) were among the catchers cut. All cuts will report to Minor League camp to be evaluated at which level each cut will start the year. A couple days later, Kyle Drabek was sent down to Minor League camp.

The next game, slated to be against the Astros, was canceled due to rain. The Jays got back to their winning ways on March 13, when Ricky Romero threw 4 shutout innings to guide the Jays to a 3\u20130 win over Atlanta. The Jays lost a day later to the Braves 8\u20135 with help from to prospect [[Jason Heyward]], who hit two doubles. Randy Ruiz hit the Jays' only home run. The Jays did not rebound nicely as the first at-bat of their next game against Detroit was a home run from [[Scott Sizemore]]. The Jays held a one-run lead going into the eighth, but collapsed and gave up 4 runs. The Jays rebounded after that by beating Baltimore in back-to-back days. The Jays won 4\u20131 on March 17 thanks to Travis Snider's first home run and Brian Tallet's second win. The Jays then pounded the Orioles 13\u20133 the next day on the strength of 6 home runs. Travis Snider and John Buck both hit two, and Aaron Hill and Chris Lubanski hit one. Ricky Romero got his team-leading third win. The Blue Jays also made some cuts on the 18th. Pitcher Zech Zinicola (acquired by the Jays in the Rule-5 draft) did not make the cut, and he was returned to Washington. Hitter Brian Dopirak also didn't make the cut, but he will stay in the Jays organization.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jordan Bastian |url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100318&content_id=8832460 |title=Ruiz's status with Jays ensured with cut &#124; bluejays.com: News |website=Toronto Blue Jays |publisher=MLB |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323112142/http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100318&content_id=8832460 |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\nThe Jays split their next two games before another game got canceled due to rain. Toronto lost to Houston 2\u20130, and beat Atlanta 7\u20136. The Jays were going to play the Red Sox for the first time in spring training, but rain in Dunedin forced the game to be canceled. From there, the Blue Jays fell into a spring training freefall, losing five in a row. The Jays lost as a split squad twice on March 26, including a disappointing loss to the Boston Red Sox. The Jays took a 2\u20130 lead into the 9th when Zach Jackson came in to close the game out. The Sox rallied for 3 runs, and walked off. The Jays' other loss was a 14\u201310 loss to the Rays. The slump caused the Jays to fall below .500, and they could not rebound. The Jays beat Pittsburgh 11\u20132 to snap the five-game slide. The next day, The Jays blew a 2\u20130 lead late against the Tigers to earn their first tie of two in spring training. But on March 31, by far the most interesting match up in spring came against the Phillies. Sandwiched between 2 losses to the Yankees was a start by Roy Halladay. \"Doc\" struggled, as he gave up 4 earned runs on five hits in 3 innings. All 4 runs were surrendered in the first inning. Four hits were extra base hits, including a 2-run shot by Aaron Hill. The Jays then entered Houston to finish up spring training. In Buck Martinez's play-by-play debut, Aaron Hill hit a two-run shot in the first inning to help jumpstart the Jays. The Jays failed to hold on to a 3\u20130 lead and surrendered a game-tying run in the 9th inning to tie the game at 3. The Jays rebounded by hitting the Astros hard and early. Aaron Hill hit his second straight first inning shot to jumpstart the Jays again, and Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n ended a disappointing spring with a 3-run home run. The Jays ended up winning 13\u20136. Their final spring training record was 12\u201313\u20132. Alex Anthopolous called it \"a great spring\" in an in-game interview with Rod Black and Pat Tabler.\n\n====April====\n[[File:Adamlind.JPG|thumb|right|[[Adam Lind]] signed a four-year contract extension through 2013 with three club options that could go through 2016.]]\nOn March 22, [[Shaun Marcum]] was named the opening-day starter for the Toronto Blue Jays. This was Marcum's first opening day start of his career. Brian Tallet was later named the Day 2 starter, ahead of Ricky Romero. Tallet is the probable home opener starter. On April 3, [[Adam Lind]] signed a long-term contract with the Jays that could keep him with the club until 2016.

''(See [[#Opening Day|below]] for opening day results).'' The Blue Jays lost 5\u20134. The Blue Jays rebounded, and won 7\u20134 the next day. Vernon Wells continued his good start by homering twice, while Toronto starter Brian Tallet pitched a quality game and earned a win. The next day, Toronto was dealt a scare, as All-Star second baseman [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] was a late scratch due to a hamstring injury. The injury was said to be minor. [[Mike McCoy (baseball)|Mike McCoy]] started at second base in place of Aaron Hill for his first career MLB start. McCoy earned his first career hit in his first at-bat of the game. McCoy finished the game 2-for-5 with an RBI. Ricky Romero and [[C. J. Wilson]] held the game scoreless until the 7th when Ricky Romero threw a wild pitch to allow David Murphy to score and give the Rangers a 1\u20130 lead. Texas held on to that lead until the 9th inning when Frank Francisco came in to close the game. Vernon Wells hit a solo shot to jumpstart the Jays to a 3-run inning that would ultimately give the Jays a 3\u20131 win. Jason Frasor made his second straight save. The win marked the first time the Jays passed the .500 mark since July 7, [[2009 Toronto Blue Jays season|2009]], when they were 43\u201342. The Jays then flew to Baltimore to play as visitor for the O's home opener. In front of 48,891 fans, the Jays quickly jumped out to a 3\u20130 lead, as Vernon Wells hit another RBI. Brandon Morrow had issues in the bottom of the first, as a lack of control helped the O's get back to tie the game at 3 on the strength of one hit. Toronto got back ahead before [[Miguel Tejada]] hit a 2-run shot in the 5th to tie the game again. Baltimore would then pull ahead in the 8th thanks to a C\u00e9sar Izturis RBI with 2 outs. [[Mike Gonzalez]] entered the game to close it out, but like Thursday, Toronto rallied in the 9th for 2 runs to pull ahead for good. [[Kevin Gregg]] earned his first save with the Jays. [[Dana Eveland]] made his first start for the Jays in the 5th game, and earned a quality start. Eveland gave up 5 hits on 7.1 innings of work, and the offense scored 3 thanks to 2 RBIs from [[Jos\u00e9 Molina (baseball)|Jos\u00e9 Molina]]. Travis Snider was intentionally walked twice to bring up Molina. With the bases loaded, Molina was hit by a pitch to bring in a run. Molina also hit a RBI single after another Snider IBB. Jason Frasor earned his first save. The win gave the Jays sole possession of first place in the AL East for the first time since May 23, 2009. The Jays continued their hot start by winning their 5th straight. Baltimore took a 2\u20131 lead into the 8th. After Kevin Millwood retired the first two, John McDonald reached first thanks to a Miguel Tejada error. That error allowed Jos\u00e9 Bautista to hit a 2-run home run to give the Jays the lead. the Jays added insurance thanks to an \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez solo shot (his second of the day), and Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n's first home run of 2010. Jason Frasor earned his fourth save. The Jays have started the season 5\u20131 for the past 2 seasons. The Jays then started their first homestand of 2010 on April 12 ''(see [[#Home opener|below]] for home opener results).'' Ricky Romero then pitched a gem in game 8, going 8 innings giving up 2 runs on 1 hit. The Jays took a 4\u20130 lead, and that was all they needed thanks to Romero. Romero struck out 12 and took a no-hitter into the 8th before [[A. J. Pierzynski]] was hit on a questionable call, and [[Alex R\u00edos]] ended the no-hit bid with a 2-run home run. Kevin Gregg earned to save to seal it. A day later the Jays were shut down, as they were only able to manage one run on two hits. The Sox put the Jays to sleep fast, thanks to 11 runs, 4 of which came from an [[Andruw Jones]] grand slam. Only 10,610 fans were there to witness that game, an all-time low for Jays games at Rogers Centre. Low opening-week attendance drew comments (unknown whether it was a joke or if they were serious) from Alex R\u00edos and Ozzie Guill\u00e9n claimed that \"Baseball is dead in Toronto\", and that [[Ice hockey|hockey]] is the reason nobody cares about baseball in Toronto. Ozzie Guill\u00e9n claimed that if hockey players were on the field, people would come. R\u00edos then blamed hockey for lack of interest in baseball, even though no professional hockey team from Toronto was playing during the opening series. R\u00edos went on to say only diehards support the Blue Jays.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/only-diehards-support-the-jays-rios-says/article1537815/\n  | title = Only diehards support the Jays, Rios says\n  | last = MacLeod\n  | first = Robert\n  |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada \n  | date = April 17, 2010\n  | accessdate =March 17, 2010\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420181358/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/only-diehards-support-the-jays-rios-says/article1537815/| archivedate= April 20, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Ozzie Guill\u00e9n did not understand why R\u00edos was booed by Jays fans.

[[Adam Lind]] pushed the lead to 3\u20130 with a solo home run in the third. Marcum took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, but after a [[Josh Hamilton]] walk, [[Vladimir Guerrero]] broke the no-hitter with a single. The next batter, [[Nelson Cruz]], hit an opposite-field three-run home run to tie the game. In the eighth, Wells hit a bases-loaded single to left-center to give the Jays a 4\u20133 lead. The Jays took the lead into the ninth inning, but closer [[Jason Frasor]] failed to convert the save opportunity. Michael Young led the inning off with a double, followed by a Guerrero infield single with one out and a game-tying RBI double from Nelson Cruz. Chris Davis was given an intentional walk to load the bases for [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]]. Saltalamacchia hit a gapper to right-center that allowed pinch runner David Murphy to score the winning run.\n\n=====Starting lineup=====\n[[File:AARON HILL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] started at second base for the 5th straight season.]]\nOnly five Blue Jays from 2009 were starting at the same position in 2010, and only three are in the same batting position in 2009.

The Jays fell below 2\u20130 early, but came back thanks to a mammoth 2-run shot by John Buck that landed in the 400 level (over the ring of honour). The Jays then fell back by 2 runs again in the third inning, but responded in the bottom of the third with a 2-run shot by Vernon Wells and a 2 RBI hit by Adam Lind. Chicago came back to tie the game, thanks to a solo shot by Andruw Jones and an RBI single by Mark Teahen that scored [[Alex R\u00edos]]. R\u00edos was playing in Toronto for the first time since being placed on waivers in July 2009. R\u00edos was welcomed back with a chorus of \"boos\". R\u00edos was booed for every at-bat, and every time he fielded a ball. The Jays climbed back on top in the bottom of the inning when Adam Lind was walked on 4 pitches with the bases loaded to give the Jays the lead again. Toronto held on to that lead, but it quickly vanished in the ninth. Jason Frasor blew another save, as he gave up a home run to Mark Teahen on an 0\u20132 pitch. The game stayed tied until the 11th when Teahen struck again this time with an RBI triple that scored pinch runner [[Omar Vizquel]] from first base. The Jays nearly walked off the next inning, but a long line drive by \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez with one on missed the foul pole by about 5 feet. Gonzalez drew a walk, but the next batter Adam Lind struck out for the third time to end the game. The Jays had their five-game win streak snapped, their streak of four straight win for their home openers was snapped too, and their ten-game winning streak against the White Sox at home was also snapped, dating back to 2007. The loss put the Jays' record to 5\u20132. Both losses were aided with a blown save by Jason Frasor. Kevin Gregg would assume the full-time role as closer a day later.\n\n==== May ====\n{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}\n\n====June====\nThe Blue Jays' last interleague series was to be a home set against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].

This was catching prospect [[J. P. Arencibia]]'s first major league game.  He was called up from Triple-A [[Las Vegas 51s|Las Vegas]] after [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]] suffered a lacerated finger caused by a foul ball.  On the first pitch he saw, Arencibia hit a two-run home run off of Rays pitcher [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]].  He also hit a single, a double, and another home run later in the game, finishing only a triple shy of the [[hitting for the cycle|cycle]].  Arencibia became the 28th player in history to hit a home run on his first pitch, the fifth player in history to hit two home runs in his first game, and the first player in the modern era to have four hits and two home runs in his first game.  He is also the only Blue Jay to ever have four hits in his major league debut.\n* On August 8, the Blue Jays again played the Tampa Bay Rays.

This was scored a hit.  Though he did not throw a no-hitter, Morrow struck out 17 batters in the game, the second most in Blue Jays history ([[Roger Clemens]] \u2013 18).

[[Jos\u00e9 Bautista]] hit is 39th and 40th home run of the game to become the first Blue Jay since 2003 to hit 40 home runs in a season. In the same game, Brandon Morrow struck out another 12 batters in under 7 innings of work to raise is K/9 average to 11.0, putting him on pace to have the highest single season k/9 average in Blue Jays history.\n* On August 31, the Blue Jays played the Tampa Bay Rays.  Jos\u00e9 Bautista hit his 43rd home run of the season.  This pushed him over the 100 RBI mark.

Ricciardi had received criticism for signing bulky, no-trade-clause contracts to players such as Vernon Wells, [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], [[Alex R\u00edos]] and [[B. J. Ryan]]; three of the four were eventually released. Problems were also raised with Ricciardi's drafts and scouting. He had drafted more than 200 players during his tenure, and had only six were the major league players at the time of his firing. One of his biggest failures was drafting [[Russ Adams]] 14th overall in the [[2002 Major League Baseball draft|2002 entry draft]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2009/10/03/ricciardi_moves_best_worst/ |title=The Best & Worst of J.

Some others criticized him for not drafting 30-home run slugger [[Troy Tulowitzki]]. Ricciardi made one of his biggest mistakes publicizing a trade for the face of the Blue Jays, [[Roy Halladay]]. In an interview on the [[CJCL|FAN 590]], he was asked if he was interested in trading Halladay, and he replied by saying \"We would not be doing our job if we did not entertain offers from other teams\". He went on to make numerous trade offers to the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] for top pitching prospects, primarily [[Kyle Drabek]], or [[J. A. Happ]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/jon_heyman/07/21/daily.scoop/index.html | work=CNN | title=Phillies won't give up Drabek for Halladay; Cliff Lee on the block? | accessdate=April 1, 2010 | date=July 21, 2009}}</ref> The Phillies stuck with reigning Cy Young winner Cliff Lee instead, closing any door on Halladay being traded. The Jays had just lost three of four in a crucial series in New York when the rumours started, and the Jays' season went downhill. Affected by the trade talks, the Jays went from seven games behind to 13, and the Rays surpassed the Jays for good during the slide. On October 30, [[Cito Gaston]] announced that he will retire after the 2010 season, but he signed a four-year consulting deal with the Jays for post-retirement. The Jays had two other members of the coaching staff leave; [[Brad Arnsberg]] left to be the Pitching Coach of the [[Houston Astros]], and hitting coach [[Gene Tenace]] also announced that he will retire, only he will not be present for the 2010 season. These moves resulted in former bullpen coach, [[Bruce Walton (baseball)|Bruce Walton]] becoming the pitching coach, and the former first base coach [[Dwayne Murphy]] took over at hitting coach. The two new coaches are [[Rick Langford]], who took the helm as Bullpen Coach, and [[Omar Malav\u00e9]] became the new first base coach. [[Brian Butterfield]] moved from first to third giving Malave room at first, and bumping [[Nick Leyva]] up to be the bench coach.\n\n=== Ownership ===\nAfter the death of Blue Jays owner [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]] following the 2008 season, speculation has also surrounded a potential change in team ownership. Home attendance reached its lowest since the 2003 season, and the Jays' management pursued attempts to shed payroll, including the releases of [[B. J. Ryan]] and [[Alex R\u00edos]] and the trade of [[Scott Rolen]] to the Cincinnati Reds.

[[Chris Lubanski]], an offseason addition, hit the Jays only home run in that game when he hit a solo shot in the 8th. In total, 6 pitchers were sent out on day one, 5 of which were in their first spring training with the Jays. A day later, the Blue Jays got their first win, defeating Detroit 9\u20137. It was an interesting day as [[Kyle Drabek]] made his much anticipated debut for the Jays, and Halladay made his Debut with the Phillies. Halladay pitched 2 hitless innings, and Drabek pitched 2 innings giving up 2 runs on 3 hits. Drabek also struck out three. [[J. P. Arencibia]] hit a 2 run home run in the top of the 9th to break a 7\u20137 tie, and ultimately give the Jays a 9\u20137 win as [[Rommie Lewis]] closed the game out in the bottom of the ninth. The Jays played the Phillies a day later and beat them 14\u20139. The Jays once held a 14\u20132 lead at one point in that game. The Blue Jays won their third straight by smashing New York 9\u20131 at Legends Field. Shawn Marcum got the win in his first start with the Jays since 2008, and won their fourth straight over Detroit to improve their record to 4\u20131. Three of the four potential closers each pitched an inning giving up a combined 2 hits and 1 run with 2 strikeouts. [[Kevin Gregg]] gave up a home run to [[Gerald Laird]] in the 4th inning, and was the only one of three to not get a strikeout. On March 8, the Blue Jays cut their first three non-roster invites, two of them being catchers. Pitcher Daniel Farquhar was the first pitcher to be cut, and catchers Matt Luizza and [[Travis d'Arnaud]] (acquired in the Doc Deal) were among the catchers cut. All cuts will report to Minor League camp to be evaluated at which level each cut will start the year. A couple days later, Kyle Drabek was sent down to Minor League camp.

The next game, slated to be against the Astros, was canceled due to rain. The Jays got back to their winning ways on March 13, when Ricky Romero threw 4 shutout innings to guide the Jays to a 3\u20130 win over Atlanta. The Jays lost a day later to the Braves 8\u20135 with help from to prospect [[Jason Heyward]], who hit two doubles. Randy Ruiz hit the Jays' only home run. The Jays did not rebound nicely as the first at-bat of their next game against Detroit was a home run from [[Scott Sizemore]]. The Jays held a one-run lead going into the eighth, but collapsed and gave up 4 runs. The Jays rebounded after that by beating Baltimore in back-to-back days. The Jays won 4\u20131 on March 17 thanks to Travis Snider's first home run and Brian Tallet's second win. The Jays then pounded the Orioles 13\u20133 the next day on the strength of 6 home runs. Travis Snider and John Buck both hit two, and Aaron Hill and Chris Lubanski hit one. Ricky Romero got his team-leading third win. The Blue Jays also made some cuts on the 18th. Pitcher Zech Zinicola (acquired by the Jays in the Rule-5 draft) did not make the cut, and he was returned to Washington. Hitter Brian Dopirak also didn't make the cut, but he will stay in the Jays organization.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jordan Bastian |url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100318&content_id=8832460 |title=Ruiz's status with Jays ensured with cut &#124; bluejays.com: News |website=Toronto Blue Jays |publisher=MLB |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323112142/http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100318&content_id=8832460 |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\nThe Jays split their next two games before another game got canceled due to rain. Toronto lost to Houston 2\u20130, and beat Atlanta 7\u20136. The Jays were going to play the Red Sox for the first time in spring training, but rain in Dunedin forced the game to be canceled. From there, the Blue Jays fell into a spring training freefall, losing five in a row. The Jays lost as a split squad twice on March 26, including a disappointing loss to the Boston Red Sox. The Jays took a 2\u20130 lead into the 9th when Zach Jackson came in to close the game out. The Sox rallied for 3 runs, and walked off. The Jays' other loss was a 14\u201310 loss to the Rays. The slump caused the Jays to fall below .500, and they could not rebound. The Jays beat Pittsburgh 11\u20132 to snap the five-game slide. The next day, The Jays blew a 2\u20130 lead late against the Tigers to earn their first tie of two in spring training. But on March 31, by far the most interesting match up in spring came against the Phillies. Sandwiched between 2 losses to the Yankees was a start by Roy Halladay. \"Doc\" struggled, as he gave up 4 earned runs on five hits in 3 innings. All 4 runs were surrendered in the first inning. Four hits were extra base hits, including a 2-run shot by Aaron Hill. The Jays then entered Houston to finish up spring training. In Buck Martinez's play-by-play debut, Aaron Hill hit a two-run shot in the first inning to help jumpstart the Jays. The Jays failed to hold on to a 3\u20130 lead and surrendered a game-tying run in the 9th inning to tie the game at 3. The Jays rebounded by hitting the Astros hard and early. Aaron Hill hit his second straight first inning shot to jumpstart the Jays again, and Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n ended a disappointing spring with a 3-run home run. The Jays ended up winning 13\u20136. Their final spring training record was 12\u201313\u20132. Alex Anthopolous called it \"a great spring\" in an in-game interview with Rod Black and Pat Tabler.\n\n====April====\n[[File:Adamlind.JPG|thumb|right|[[Adam Lind]] signed a four-year contract extension through 2013 with three club options that could go through 2016.]]\nOn March 22, [[Shaun Marcum]] was named the opening-day starter for the Toronto Blue Jays. This was Marcum's first opening day start of his career. Brian Tallet was later named the Day 2 starter, ahead of Ricky Romero. Tallet is the probable home opener starter. On April 3, [[Adam Lind]] signed a long-term contract with the Jays that could keep him with the club until 2016.

''(See [[#Opening Day|below]] for opening day results).'' The Blue Jays lost 5\u20134. The Blue Jays rebounded, and won 7\u20134 the next day. Vernon Wells continued his good start by homering twice, while Toronto starter Brian Tallet pitched a quality game and earned a win. The next day, Toronto was dealt a scare, as All-Star second baseman [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] was a late scratch due to a hamstring injury. The injury was said to be minor. [[Mike McCoy (baseball)|Mike McCoy]] started at second base in place of Aaron Hill for his first career MLB start. McCoy earned his first career hit in his first at-bat of the game. McCoy finished the game 2-for-5 with an RBI. Ricky Romero and [[C. J. Wilson]] held the game scoreless until the 7th when Ricky Romero threw a wild pitch to allow David Murphy to score and give the Rangers a 1\u20130 lead. Texas held on to that lead until the 9th inning when Frank Francisco came in to close the game. Vernon Wells hit a solo shot to jumpstart the Jays to a 3-run inning that would ultimately give the Jays a 3\u20131 win. Jason Frasor made his second straight save. The win marked the first time the Jays passed the .500 mark since July 7, [[2009 Toronto Blue Jays season|2009]], when they were 43\u201342. The Jays then flew to Baltimore to play as visitor for the O's home opener. In front of 48,891 fans, the Jays quickly jumped out to a 3\u20130 lead, as Vernon Wells hit another RBI. Brandon Morrow had issues in the bottom of the first, as a lack of control helped the O's get back to tie the game at 3 on the strength of one hit. Toronto got back ahead before [[Miguel Tejada]] hit a 2-run shot in the 5th to tie the game again. Baltimore would then pull ahead in the 8th thanks to a C\u00e9sar Izturis RBI with 2 outs. [[Mike Gonzalez]] entered the game to close it out, but like Thursday, Toronto rallied in the 9th for 2 runs to pull ahead for good. [[Kevin Gregg]] earned his first save with the Jays. [[Dana Eveland]] made his first start for the Jays in the 5th game, and earned a quality start. Eveland gave up 5 hits on 7.1 innings of work, and the offense scored 3 thanks to 2 RBIs from [[Jos\u00e9 Molina (baseball)|Jos\u00e9 Molina]]. Travis Snider was intentionally walked twice to bring up Molina. With the bases loaded, Molina was hit by a pitch to bring in a run. Molina also hit a RBI single after another Snider IBB. Jason Frasor earned his first save. The win gave the Jays sole possession of first place in the AL East for the first time since May 23, 2009. The Jays continued their hot start by winning their 5th straight. Baltimore took a 2\u20131 lead into the 8th. After Kevin Millwood retired the first two, John McDonald reached first thanks to a Miguel Tejada error. That error allowed Jos\u00e9 Bautista to hit a 2-run home run to give the Jays the lead. the Jays added insurance thanks to an \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez solo shot (his second of the day), and Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n's first home run of 2010. Jason Frasor earned his fourth save. The Jays have started the season 5\u20131 for the past 2 seasons. The Jays then started their first homestand of 2010 on April 12 ''(see [[#Home opener|below]] for home opener results).'' Ricky Romero then pitched a gem in game 8, going 8 innings giving up 2 runs on 1 hit. The Jays took a 4\u20130 lead, and that was all they needed thanks to Romero. Romero struck out 12 and took a no-hitter into the 8th before [[A. J. Pierzynski]] was hit on a questionable call, and [[Alex R\u00edos]] ended the no-hit bid with a 2-run home run. Kevin Gregg earned to save to seal it. A day later the Jays were shut down, as they were only able to manage one run on two hits. The Sox put the Jays to sleep fast, thanks to 11 runs, 4 of which came from an [[Andruw Jones]] grand slam. Only 10,610 fans were there to witness that game, an all-time low for Jays games at Rogers Centre. Low opening-week attendance drew comments (unknown whether it was a joke or if they were serious) from Alex R\u00edos and Ozzie Guill\u00e9n claimed that \"Baseball is dead in Toronto\", and that [[Ice hockey|hockey]] is the reason nobody cares about baseball in Toronto. Ozzie Guill\u00e9n claimed that if hockey players were on the field, people would come. R\u00edos then blamed hockey for lack of interest in baseball, even though no professional hockey team from Toronto was playing during the opening series. R\u00edos went on to say only diehards support the Blue Jays.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/only-diehards-support-the-jays-rios-says/article1537815/\n  | title = Only diehards support the Jays, Rios says\n  | last = MacLeod\n  | first = Robert\n  |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada \n  | date = April 17, 2010\n  | accessdate =March 17, 2010\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420181358/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/baseball/only-diehards-support-the-jays-rios-says/article1537815/| archivedate= April 20, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Ozzie Guill\u00e9n did not understand why R\u00edos was booed by Jays fans.

[[Adam Lind]] pushed the lead to 3\u20130 with a solo home run in the third. Marcum took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, but after a [[Josh Hamilton]] walk, [[Vladimir Guerrero]] broke the no-hitter with a single. The next batter, [[Nelson Cruz]], hit an opposite-field three-run home run to tie the game. In the eighth, Wells hit a bases-loaded single to left-center to give the Jays a 4\u20133 lead. The Jays took the lead into the ninth inning, but closer [[Jason Frasor]] failed to convert the save opportunity. Michael Young led the inning off with a double, followed by a Guerrero infield single with one out and a game-tying RBI double from Nelson Cruz. Chris Davis was given an intentional walk to load the bases for [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]]. Saltalamacchia hit a gapper to right-center that allowed pinch runner David Murphy to score the winning run.\n\n=====Starting lineup=====\n[[File:AARON HILL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] started at second base for the 5th straight season.]]\nOnly five Blue Jays from 2009 were starting at the same position in 2010, and only three are in the same batting position in 2009.

The Jays fell below 2\u20130 early, but came back thanks to a mammoth 2-run shot by John Buck that landed in the 400 level (over the ring of honour). The Jays then fell back by 2 runs again in the third inning, but responded in the bottom of the third with a 2-run shot by Vernon Wells and a 2 RBI hit by Adam Lind. Chicago came back to tie the game, thanks to a solo shot by Andruw Jones and an RBI single by Mark Teahen that scored [[Alex R\u00edos]]. R\u00edos was playing in Toronto for the first time since being placed on waivers in July 2009. R\u00edos was welcomed back with a chorus of \"boos\". R\u00edos was booed for every at-bat, and every time he fielded a ball. The Jays climbed back on top in the bottom of the inning when Adam Lind was walked on 4 pitches with the bases loaded to give the Jays the lead again. Toronto held on to that lead, but it quickly vanished in the ninth. Jason Frasor blew another save, as he gave up a home run to Mark Teahen on an 0\u20132 pitch. The game stayed tied until the 11th when Teahen struck again this time with an RBI triple that scored pinch runner [[Omar Vizquel]] from first base. The Jays nearly walked off the next inning, but a long line drive by \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez with one on missed the foul pole by about 5 feet. Gonzalez drew a walk, but the next batter Adam Lind struck out for the third time to end the game. The Jays had their five-game win streak snapped, their streak of four straight win for their home openers was snapped too, and their ten-game winning streak against the White Sox at home was also snapped, dating back to 2007. The loss put the Jays' record to 5\u20132. Both losses were aided with a blown save by Jason Frasor. Kevin Gregg would assume the full-time role as closer a day later.\n\n==== May ====\n{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}\n\n====June====\nThe Blue Jays' last interleague series was to be a home set against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].

This was catching prospect [[J. P. Arencibia]]'s first major league game.  He was called up from Triple-A [[Las Vegas 51s|Las Vegas]] after [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]] suffered a lacerated finger caused by a foul ball.  On the first pitch he saw, Arencibia hit a two-run home run off of Rays pitcher [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]].  He also hit a single, a double, and another home run later in the game, finishing only a triple shy of the [[hitting for the cycle|cycle]].  Arencibia became the 28th player in history to hit a home run on his first pitch, the fifth player in history to hit two home runs in his first game, and the first player in the modern era to have four hits and two home runs in his first game.  He is also the only Blue Jay to ever have four hits in his major league debut.\n* On August 8, the Blue Jays again played the Tampa Bay Rays.

This was scored a hit.  Though he did not throw a no-hitter, Morrow struck out 17 batters in the game, the second most in Blue Jays history ([[Roger Clemens]] \u2013 18).

[[Jos\u00e9 Bautista]] hit is 39th and 40th home run of the game to become the first Blue Jay since 2003 to hit 40 home runs in a season. In the same game, Brandon Morrow struck out another 12 batters in under 7 innings of work to raise is K/9 average to 11.0, putting him on pace to have the highest single season k/9 average in Blue Jays history.\n* On August 31, the Blue Jays played the Tampa Bay Rays.  Jos\u00e9 Bautista hit his 43rd home run of the season.  This pushed him over the 100 RBI mark.
