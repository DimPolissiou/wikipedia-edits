It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England.

[[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref name=\"icc-hist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/womens-world-cup/history |title=ICC Women's World Cup History |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams; six of which ([[Australia women's national cricket team|Australia]], [[England women's cricket team|England]], [[India women's national cricket team|India]], [[New Zealand women's national cricket team|New Zealand]], [[Sri Lanka women's national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and the [[West Indies women's cricket team|West Indies]]) qualified automatically due to finishing as the top six teams at the [[2005 Women's Cricket World Cup]], while the other two (Pakistan and South Africa) qualified through the [[2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Women's Cricket and Global Processes: The Emergence and Development of Women's Cricket as a Global Game |last=Velija |first=Philippa |year=2015 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=[[Basingstoke]] |p=102 |isbn=978-1-137-32351-4}}</ref> Matches took place at various cricket grounds in Australia between 7 and 22 March, featuring 25 matches over 16 days.<ref name=\"matches\">{{cite web |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/scores/series/8584/season/2009/icc-womens-world-cup |title=ICC Women's World Cup 2009 \u2013 Fixtures and Results |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the ICC had successfully developed and expanded the women's game, from 15 member countries in 2005 to 42 in 2007, there was still a growing gap between the top four teams\u2014Australia, England, India and New Zealand\u2014and the rest.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TIAnBwAAQBAJ |title=Cricket and Globalization |editor1-last=Rumford |editor1-first=Chris |editor2-last=Wagg |editor2-first=Stephen |year=2010 |publisher=[[Cambridge Scholars Publishing]] |location=[[Newcastle upon Tyne]] |isbn=978-1-4438-2370-8 |chapter=Women at the Wicket: The Development of Women's Cricket in England and Overseas |last1=Velija |first1=Philippa |last2=Ratna |first2=Aarti |last3=Flintoff |first3=Anne |pages=115\u2013116}}</ref> In 2008, England, and then Australia, became the first teams to introduce contracts for some of their women's players;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22864609/australia-women-handed-contracts |title=Australia women handed contracts |last=Roesler |first=Jenny |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> [[Charlotte Edwards]], England's [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], said that this allowed the players to \"commit to training without worrying about our jobs outside cricket.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BcOkAwAAQBAJ |title=Young Wisden: A New Fan's Guide to Cricket |last1=de Lisle |first1=Tim |last2=Booth |first2=Lawrence |publisher=John Wisden & Co |location=London |year=2011 |orig-year=2007 |page=40 |isbn=978-1-4081-2463-5}}</ref> Before the competition, Jenny Roesler of ''[[ESPNcricinfo|Cricinfo]]'' suggested England and New Zealand, along with Australia, as the favourites to win the competition.<ref name=\"three-way\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wwc2009/content/story/393395.html |title=A three-way battle to stand on top of the world |last=Roesler |first=Jenny |website=ESPNcricinfo |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> [[Haidee Tiffen]], the captain of New Zealand, said that she thought \"Australia, New Zealand, England and India are of equal strength and any team can beat the other on its day.

An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as [[ketosis]], leads to a reduction in the frequency of [[epileptic seizure]]s.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Some evidence indicates that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified [[Atkins diet]], is similarly effective.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Potential side effects may include [[constipation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], growth slowing, [[acidosis]], and [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]].<ref name=Kossoff2013/>\n\nThe original therapeutic diet for [[epilepsy in children|paediatric epilepsy]] provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient [[food energy|calories]]<ref name=Units group=Note/> to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective [[anticonvulsant]] medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1  ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs)\u2014made from fatty acids with shorter [[carbon chain]]s than LCTs\u2014are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of [[coconut oil]], which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.<ref name=Liu2008/><ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]], whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] program and ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'' (1997), a [[television movie|made-for-television film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]]. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which\u2014announced in 1996\u2014marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/> \n\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\n==Epilepsy==\n[[Epilepsy]] is one of the most common [[neurology|neurological]] disorders after [[stroke]],<ref name=Stafstrom2004/> affecting around 50&nbsp;million people worldwide.<ref name=deBoer2008/> It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked [[seizure]]s. These occur when [[cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] [[neuron]]s fire excessively, [[Hypersynchronization of electrophysiological activity in epilepsy|hypersynchronously]], or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be [[focal seizure|focal]] (confined to a specific part of the brain) or [[generalised seizure|generalised]] (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic [[syndrome]]s, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three [[anticonvulsant]] drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include [[epilepsy surgery]], [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n==History==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[Mainstream#In science|mainstream]] dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of [[fasting]] to treat epilepsy.<ref name=Fasting group=Note/> Although popular in the 1920s and '30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20\u201330% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.<ref name=Freeman2007/><ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Fasting===\n[[File:Conklin Fasting - NewYorkTimes.png|thumb|alt=Scan of newspaper column. See image description page for full text.|A news report of Dr Hugh Conklin's \"water diet\" treatment from 1922]]\n\nPhysicians of [[ancient Greece]] treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'', covers the disease; it  dates from {{circa|400 BC}}. Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis.<ref name=Hippocrates1 group=Note/> In the same collection, the author of ''Epidemics'' describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink.<ref name=Hippocrates2 group=Note/> The royal physician [[Erasistratus]] declared, \"One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations.\"<ref name=Galen1 group=Note/> [[Galen]] believed an \"attenuating diet\"<ref name=Galen2 group=Note/> might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.<ref name=Temkin1971/>\n\nThe first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911.<ref name=Guelpa1911/> Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were \"detoxified\" by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients' mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, [[potassium bromide]], which dulled the mind.<ref name=Bailey2005/>\n\nAround this time, [[Bernarr Macfadden]], an American exponent of [[physical culture]], popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] Dr. Hugh William Conklin of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the [[Peyer's patches]] in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25&nbsp;days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his \"water diet\" and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin's case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nConklin's fasting therapy was adopted by [[neurology|neurologists]] in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the ''New York Medical Journal'' claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the [[American Medical Association]] convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite having studied the patients for only a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. [[Charles P. Howland]], the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study \"the ketosis of starvation\". As professor of paediatrics at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist [[Stanley Cobb]] and his assistant [[William G. Lennox]].<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Diet===\nIn 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and [[diabetes]]. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]], and [[acetone]] (known collectively as [[ketone bodies]]), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.<ref name=Wheless2004/> Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the [[Mayo Clinic]], built on this research and coined the term \"ketogenic diet\" to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood ([[ketonemia]]) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nWilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10\u201315&nbsp;g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka, Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.<ref name=Wheless2004/><ref name=Kossoff2007/>\n\n===Anticonvulsants and decline===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative [[Potassium bromide|bromides]] (discovered 1857) and [[phenobarbital]] (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when [[H. Houston Merritt|H. Houston Merritt, Jr.]] and [[Tracy Putnam]] discovered [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of [[sodium valproate]] in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as [[Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome]], declined further.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===MCT diet===\n[[File:Liquigen edit.jpg|thumb|alt=A glass bottle of 250 ml of Liquigen, a white opaque liquid|[[Medium-chain triglyceride]] (MCT) oil emulsion]]\nIn the 1960s,  [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides).<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the [[hepatic portal system]] rather than the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name=Neal2008/> The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, [[Peter Huttenlocher]] devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Revival===\nThe ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]]. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to [[John M. Freeman (neurologist)|John M. Freeman]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research.<ref name=Wheless2004/> A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published<ref name=Vining1998/> in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'', starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\nBy 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\n==Efficacy==\nThe ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Some evidence indicates that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Trial design===\nEarly studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a [[Cohort study|cohort]] of patients recently treated by the physician (a [[retrospective study]]) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from [[selection bias]], as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a [[prospective cohort study|prospective cohort]] (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as [[Intention to treat analysis|intent-to-treat analysis]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nAnother difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged [[fasting|fast]], designed to lose 5\u201310% [[body weight]], and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Outcomes===\nA study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]<ref name=Freeman1998/> and followed-up by a report published in 2001.<ref name=Hemingway2001/> As with most studies of the ketogenic diet,  no [[control group]] (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free.<ref name=Reduction group=Note/> At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.<ref name=Hemingway2001/><ref name=Kossoff2009c/>\n\nIt is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone\u2014a statistical method known as [[meta-analysis]]. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients.<ref name=Henderson2006/> It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control<ref name=Neal2008 />, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/>\n\nA systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up with the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence was inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]], high total [[cholesterol]], and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Liu2018/>\n\n==Indications and contraindications==\n[[File:Anticonvulsants.jpg|thumb|alt=Anticonvulsants|Experts on the ketogenic diet recommend it be strongly considered for children with uncontrolled epilepsy who have tried and failed two or three anticonvulsant drugs;<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> most children who start the ketogenic diet have failed at least three times this number.<ref name=Bergqvist2004/>]]\nThe ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with [[drug-resistant epilepsy]].<ref name=NICE/><ref name=SIGN/> It is approved by national [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]] in Scotland,<ref name=SIGN/> England, and Wales<ref name=NICE/> and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies.<ref name=Turner2006/> Children with a focal [[lesion]] (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for [[epilepsy surgery|surgery]] are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Stainman2007/> About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants\u2014the low [[glycaemic index]] treatment and the modified Atkins diet\u2014to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are [[feeding tube|tube-fed]].<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/><ref name=Kossoff2004b/>\n\nAdvocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Kossoff2004a/><ref name=Spendiff2008/> The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include [[Dravet syndrome]], [[infantile spasms]], [[myoclonic-astatic epilepsy]], and [[tuberous sclerosis complex]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Wang2014/>\n\nA survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] and clinical practice.<ref name=Mastriani2008/> One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained [[dietitian]]s who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\nBecause the ketogenic diet alters the body's metabolism, it is a [[first-line therapy]] in children with certain [[congenital metabolic disease]]s such as [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency|pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency]] and [[De Vivo disease|glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome]],<ref name=Wang2018/> which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.<ref name=Huffman2006/> However, it is absolutely [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the treatment of other diseases such as [[pyruvate carboxylase deficiency]], [[porphyria]], and other rare [[Inborn errors of lipid metabolism|genetic disorders of fat metabolism]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to [[ketoacidosis]], and eventually coma and death.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\n==Interactions==\nThe ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. Some evidence of synergistic benefits is seen when the diet is combined with the [[vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulator]] or with the drug [[zonisamide]], and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving [[phenobarbital]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\nThe ketogenic diet is not considered a [[Benignity|benign]], holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery.<ref name=Turner2006/> Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include [[constipation]], low-grade [[acidosis]], and [[hypoglycaemia]] if an initial fast is undertaken. [[Hyperlipidemia|Raised levels of lipids in the blood]] affect up to 60% of children<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> and [[Hypercholesterolemia|cholesterol levels may increase]] by around 30%.<ref name=Turner2006/> This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many [[micronutrient]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nLong-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and [[kidney stone]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> The diet reduces levels of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]] ([[topiramate]], [[zonisamide]]) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone.<ref name=Sampath2007/> The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet.<ref name=Sampath2007/> Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral [[potassium citrate]] supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in one-seventh of the incidence of kidney stones.<ref name=McNally2009/> However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Excess calcium in the urine ([[hypercalciuria]]) occurs due to increased bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones are mainly composed of [[calcium phosphate]]. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Hypocitraturia: the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* The urine has a low pH, which stops [[uric acid]] from dissolving, leading to crystals that act as a [[wikt:nidus|nidus]] for calcium stone formation.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80% of normal daily needs;<ref name=Sampath2007/> this practice is no longer encouraged.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nIn adolescent and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, [[dyslipidemia]], and in women, [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name=Kossoff2006/>\n\n==Implementation==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[medical nutrition therapy]] that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric [[dietitian]] who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric [[neurologist]] who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a [[registered nurse]] who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a [[medical social worker]] who works with the family and a [[pharmacist]] who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nImplementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.<ref name=Vogelstein2010/>\n\n===Initiation===\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted.<ref name=Kim2008/> It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nAt the initial consultation, patients are [[screening (medicine)|screened]] for conditions that may [[contraindicate]] the diet. A dietary [[medical history|history]] is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nThe day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/> are allowed until dinner, which consists of \"[[eggnog]]\"<ref name=Eggnog group=Note/> restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the \"eggnog\" dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal's caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not \"eggnog\"). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nWhen in the hospital, [[blood sugar|glucose levels]] are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic [[ketosis]] (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks.<ref name=Vining1998/> The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/>\n\nVariations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using [[outpatient]] clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of [[metabolic acidosis|acidosis]], hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nFor patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/> Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Maintenance===\nAfter initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital [[dietitian]]<ref name=Hartman2007b/> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> [[ketonuria|Urinary ketone levels]] are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> This is performed using ketone test strips containing [[nitroprusside]], which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).<ref name=Musa-Veloso2004/>\n\nA short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if [[ketone]] levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even \"sugar-free\" food can contain carbohydrates such as [[maltodextrin]], [[sorbitol]], [[starch]], and [[fructose]]. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\n===Discontinuation===\nAbout 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions.<ref name=Martinez2007/> This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nChildren who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30\u201350% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an [[electroencephalogram]]  shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an [[MRI scan]] shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with [[tuberous sclerosis]]). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.<ref name=Martinez2007/>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Ketogenic diets pie MCT.svg|thumb|alt=A series of four pie charts for the typical American diet, the induction phase of the Atkins diet, the classic ketogenic diet, and the MCD ketogenic diet. The typical American diet has about half its calories from carbohydrates, where the others have very little carbohydrate. The Atkins diet is higher in protein than the others. Most of the fat in the MCT diet comes from MCT oil.|The ratio of calorific contributions from food components of four diets, by weight]]\n\nThe ketogenic diet is calculated by a [[dietitian]] for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80\u201390% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle [[spasticity]] require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18&nbsp;months, older than 12&nbsp;years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9&nbsp;kcal/g (38&nbsp;kJ/g) compared to 4&nbsp;kcal/g (17&nbsp;kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1&nbsp;g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or [[dietary supplement|supplements]] must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nA computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008b/> The meals often have four components: [[cream|heavy whipping cream]], a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic [[weighing scale|scale]] accurate to 1&nbsp;g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nThe classic ketogenic diet is not a [[balanced diet]] and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, [[Food fortification|fortified]] cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the [[B vitamins]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]] must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient's age: a [[multivitamin]] with [[Dietary mineral|minerals]] and [[calcium]] with vitamin D.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500&nbsp;kcal (6,300&nbsp;kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:<ref name=Turner2006/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Sample meal plan for one day\n!Meal\n!Menu idea\n!Ingredients\n|-\n|Breakfast\n|Egg with bacon\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g egg (about half an egg)\n* 11&nbsp;g bacon (about half a slice)\n* 37&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 23&nbsp;g butter\n* 9&nbsp;g slice of apple (about 5% of one apple)\n|-\n|Morning snack\n|Peanut butter ball\n(serving size: 0.5&nbsp;ounce)\n|\n* 6&nbsp;g peanut butter\n* 9&nbsp;g butter\n|-\n|Lunch\n|Tuna salad\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g tuna fish\n* 30&nbsp;g mayonnaise\n* 10&nbsp;g celery\n* 36&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 15&nbsp;g lettuce (one large leaf)\n|-\n|Afternoon snack\n|Keto yogurt\n(serving size: 1.3&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 18&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 17&nbsp;g sour cream\n* 4&nbsp;g strawberries (about half of one small strawberry)\n* [[artificial sweetener]]\n|-\n|Dinner\n|Cheeseburger (no bun)\n|\n* 22&nbsp;g [[Ground beef|minced (ground) beef]]\n* 10&nbsp;g [[American cheese]] (half a slice of cheese)\n* 26&nbsp;g butter\n* 38&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 10&nbsp;g lettuce (one medium leaf)\n* 11&nbsp;g green beans (one spoonful)\n|-\n|Evening snack\n|Keto custard\n(serving size: 1.2&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 25&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 9&nbsp;g egg (half a [[tablespoon]])\n* Pure, unsweetened vanilla flavouring\n|}\n\n===MCT oil===\nNormal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). [[Medium-chain triglycerides]] (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate,<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes.<ref name=Liu2008/> The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by [[health insurance|insurance companies]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Modified Atkins===\nFirst reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10&nbsp;g per day in children or 20&nbsp;g per day in adults, and are increased to 20\u201330&nbsp;g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/>\n\nThe modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/> Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favorably with the traditional ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Low glycemic index treatment===\nThe low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)<ref name=Pfeifer2013/> is an attempt to achieve the stable [[blood glucose]] levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet,<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat),<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40\u201360&nbsp;g per day.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nShort-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/><ref name=Muzykewicz2009/>\n\n===Prescribed formulations===\n[[File:Measuring Ketocal.jpg|thumb|alt=A cream-coloured powder is poured from a tin into a measuring jug on an electronic kitchen scale.|Measuring KetoCal\u2014a powdered formula for administering the classic ketogenic diet]]\nInfants and patients fed via a [[Feeding tube|gastrostomy tube]] can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/> Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total [[cholesterol]] than a solid ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> KetoCal is a [[Enteral formula|nutritionally complete food]] containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding.<ref name=KetoCal/> Other formula products include KetoVolve<ref name=KetoVolve/> and Ketonia.<ref name=KetoBottle/> Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.<ref name=KetoBottle/>\n\n===Worldwide===\nThere are theoretically no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory, so calculating macronutrients such as fat, protein and carbohydrates can be difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn Asia, the traditional diet includes rice and noodles as the main source of energy, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians and will not eat root vegetables and will try to avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.<ref name=Kossoff2008b/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\n\n===Seizure pathology===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = [[Ketone bodies]]\n\n | image1 = beta-Hydroxybutyric acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = Skeletal formula of 3-hydroxybutyric acid\n | caption1 = [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]]\n\n | image2 = Acetoacetic acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | alt2 = Skeletal formula of 3-oxobutanoic acid\n | caption2 = [[acetoacetic acid]]\n\n | image3 = Acetone-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width3 = 75\n | alt3 = Skeletal formula of acetone\n | caption3 = [[acetone]]\n}}\nThe brain is composed of a network of [[Neurotransmission|neurons that transmit signals]] by propagating [[nerve impulse]]s. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by [[neurotransmitter]]s, though there are also [[Electrical synapse|electrical pathways]] between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|\u03b3-aminobutyric acid]], or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by [[glutamate]]). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThe nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through [[Voltage-gated sodium channel|channels]] in the neuron's [[cell membrane]] followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]), which is mediated by another [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|potassium channel]]. The flow through these [[ion channel]]s is governed by a \"gate\" which is opened by either a voltage change or a [[Ligand-gated ion channel|chemical messenger]] known as a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThere are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n===Seizure control===\nAlthough many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include [[Metabolic acidosis|systemic acidosis]] (high levels of acid in the blood), [[Electrolyte disturbance|electrolyte changes]] and [[hypoglycaemia]] (low [[blood glucose]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nOn the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty-acid oxidation]] in the cell's [[mitochondria]] (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some [[amino acid]]s into glucose by a process called [[gluconeogenesis]], but cannot do this by using fatty acids.<ref name=Kerndt1982/> Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three [[ketone bodies]] [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]] and [[acetone]]. These ketone bodies enter the brain and ''partially'' substitute for [[blood glucose]] as a source of energy.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in [[animal model]]s, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the [[neuron]]s to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a [[neuroprotective]] effect.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant.  Conversely, [[fenofibrate]], not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental [[anticonvulsant]] properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Porta2009/>  This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nAnticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants ([[valproate]], [[levetiracetam]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\n==Other applications==\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[autism]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\nBecause some cancer cells are [[Warburg effect (oncology)|inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy]], the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer.<ref name=\"Baranano2008\" /><ref name=\"Allen2014\" />  A 2018 review looked at the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy. The clinical studies in humans are typically very small, with some providing weak evidence for anti-tumour effect, particularly for [[glioblastoma]], but in other cancers and studies, no anti-tumour effect was seen. Taken together, results from preclinical studies, albeit sometimes contradictory, tend to support an anti-tumor effect rather than a pro-tumor effect of the KD for most solid cancers.<ref name=Weber2018/>\n\nThe evidence of benefit for these conditions has not reached the level where clinical recommendations can be made.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Atkins diet]] \u2013 brand of low-carbohydrate diet\n* [[Ketosis]] \u2013 metabolic process that uses fats as an energy source\n* [[List of diets]]\n* [[Low-carbohydrate diet]] \u2013 varieties of diets that focus on reducing carbohydrates\n* [[Medium-chain triglyceride]] \u2013 easily absorbed, naturally occurring type of fat \n* [[Fad diet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em|group=Note|refs=\n{{#tag:ref|Ketogenic \"eggnog\" is used during induction and is a drink with the required ketogenic ratio.

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than [[carbohydrate]]s. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into [[glucose]], which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in [[Brain metabolism|fueling brain function]]. However, if little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the [[liver]] converts [[triacylglycerol|fat]] into [[fatty acid]]s and [[ketone bodies]]. The ketone bodies pass into the [[brain]] and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as [[ketosis]], leads to a reduction in the frequency of [[epileptic seizure]]s.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Some evidence indicates that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified [[Atkins diet]], is similarly effective.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Potential side effects may include [[constipation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], growth slowing, [[acidosis]], and [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]].<ref name=Kossoff2013/>\n\nThe original therapeutic diet for [[epilepsy in children|paediatric epilepsy]] provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient [[food energy|calories]]<ref name=Units group=Note/> to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective [[anticonvulsant]] medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1  ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs)\u2014made from fatty acids with shorter [[carbon chain]]s than LCTs\u2014are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of [[coconut oil]], which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.<ref name=Liu2008/><ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]], whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] program and ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'' (1997), a [[television movie|made-for-television film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]]. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which\u2014announced in 1996\u2014marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/> \n\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\n==Epilepsy==\n[[Epilepsy]] is one of the most common [[neurology|neurological]] disorders after [[stroke]],<ref name=Stafstrom2004/> affecting around 50&nbsp;million people worldwide.<ref name=deBoer2008/> It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked [[seizure]]s. These occur when [[cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] [[neuron]]s fire excessively, [[Hypersynchronization of electrophysiological activity in epilepsy|hypersynchronously]], or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be [[focal seizure|focal]] (confined to a specific part of the brain) or [[generalised seizure|generalised]] (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic [[syndrome]]s, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three [[anticonvulsant]] drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include [[epilepsy surgery]], [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n==History==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[Mainstream#In science|mainstream]] dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of [[fasting]] to treat epilepsy.<ref name=Fasting group=Note/> Although popular in the 1920s and '30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20\u201330% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.<ref name=Freeman2007/><ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Fasting===\n[[File:Conklin Fasting - NewYorkTimes.png|thumb|alt=Scan of newspaper column. See image description page for full text.|A news report of Dr Hugh Conklin's \"water diet\" treatment from 1922]]\n\nPhysicians of [[ancient Greece]] treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'', covers the disease; it  dates from {{circa|400 BC}}. Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis.<ref name=Hippocrates1 group=Note/> In the same collection, the author of ''Epidemics'' describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink.<ref name=Hippocrates2 group=Note/> The royal physician [[Erasistratus]] declared, \"One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations.\"<ref name=Galen1 group=Note/> [[Galen]] believed an \"attenuating diet\"<ref name=Galen2 group=Note/> might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.<ref name=Temkin1971/>\n\nThe first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911.<ref name=Guelpa1911/> Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were \"detoxified\" by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients' mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, [[potassium bromide]], which dulled the mind.<ref name=Bailey2005/>\n\nAround this time, [[Bernarr Macfadden]], an American exponent of [[physical culture]], popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] Dr. Hugh William Conklin of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the [[Peyer's patches]] in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25&nbsp;days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his \"water diet\" and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin's case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nConklin's fasting therapy was adopted by [[neurology|neurologists]] in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the ''New York Medical Journal'' claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the [[American Medical Association]] convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite having studied the patients for only a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. [[Charles P. Howland]], the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study \"the ketosis of starvation\". As professor of paediatrics at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist [[Stanley Cobb]] and his assistant [[William G. Lennox]].<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Diet===\nIn 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and [[diabetes]]. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]], and [[acetone]] (known collectively as [[ketone bodies]]), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.<ref name=Wheless2004/> Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the [[Mayo Clinic]], built on this research and coined the term \"ketogenic diet\" to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood ([[ketonemia]]) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nWilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10\u201315&nbsp;g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka, Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.<ref name=Wheless2004/><ref name=Kossoff2007/>\n\n===Anticonvulsants and decline===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative [[Potassium bromide|bromides]] (discovered 1857) and [[phenobarbital]] (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when [[H. Houston Merritt|H. Houston Merritt, Jr.]] and [[Tracy Putnam]] discovered [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of [[sodium valproate]] in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as [[Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome]], declined further.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===MCT diet===\n[[File:Liquigen edit.jpg|thumb|alt=A glass bottle of 250 ml of Liquigen, a white opaque liquid|[[Medium-chain triglyceride]] (MCT) oil emulsion]]\nIn the 1960s,  [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides).<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the [[hepatic portal system]] rather than the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name=Neal2008/> The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, [[Peter Huttenlocher]] devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Revival===\nThe ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]]. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to [[John M. Freeman (neurologist)|John M. Freeman]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research.<ref name=Wheless2004/> A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published<ref name=Vining1998/> in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'', starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\nBy 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\n==Efficacy==\nThe ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Some evidence indicates that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Trial design===\nEarly studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a [[Cohort study|cohort]] of patients recently treated by the physician (a [[retrospective study]]) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from [[selection bias]], as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a [[prospective cohort study|prospective cohort]] (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as [[Intention to treat analysis|intent-to-treat analysis]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nAnother difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged [[fasting|fast]], designed to lose 5\u201310% [[body weight]], and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Outcomes===\nA study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]<ref name=Freeman1998/> and followed-up by a report published in 2001.<ref name=Hemingway2001/> As with most studies of the ketogenic diet,  no [[control group]] (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free.<ref name=Reduction group=Note/> At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.<ref name=Hemingway2001/><ref name=Kossoff2009c/>\n\nIt is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone\u2014a statistical method known as [[meta-analysis]]. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients.<ref name=Henderson2006/> It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control<ref name=Neal2008 />, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/>\n\nA systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up with the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence was inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]], high total [[cholesterol]], and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Liu2018/>\n\n==Indications and contraindications==\n[[File:Anticonvulsants.jpg|thumb|alt=Anticonvulsants|Experts on the ketogenic diet recommend it be strongly considered for children with uncontrolled epilepsy who have tried and failed two or three anticonvulsant drugs;<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> most children who start the ketogenic diet have failed at least three times this number.<ref name=Bergqvist2004/>]]\nThe ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with [[drug-resistant epilepsy]].<ref name=NICE/><ref name=SIGN/> It is approved by national [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]] in Scotland,<ref name=SIGN/> England, and Wales<ref name=NICE/> and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies.<ref name=Turner2006/> Children with a focal [[lesion]] (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for [[epilepsy surgery|surgery]] are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Stainman2007/> About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants\u2014the low [[glycaemic index]] treatment and the modified Atkins diet\u2014to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are [[feeding tube|tube-fed]].<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/><ref name=Kossoff2004b/>\n\nAdvocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Kossoff2004a/><ref name=Spendiff2008/> The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include [[Dravet syndrome]], [[infantile spasms]], [[myoclonic-astatic epilepsy]], and [[tuberous sclerosis complex]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Wang2014/>\n\nA survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] and clinical practice.<ref name=Mastriani2008/> One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained [[dietitian]]s who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\nBecause the ketogenic diet alters the body's metabolism, it is a [[first-line therapy]] in children with certain [[congenital metabolic disease]]s such as [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency|pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency]] and [[De Vivo disease|glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome]],<ref name=Wang2018/> which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.<ref name=Huffman2006/> However, it is absolutely [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the treatment of other diseases such as [[pyruvate carboxylase deficiency]], [[porphyria]], and other rare [[Inborn errors of lipid metabolism|genetic disorders of fat metabolism]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to [[ketoacidosis]], and eventually coma and death.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\n==Interactions==\nThe ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. Some evidence of synergistic benefits is seen when the diet is combined with the [[vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulator]] or with the drug [[zonisamide]], and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving [[phenobarbital]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\nThe ketogenic diet is not considered a [[Benignity|benign]], holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery.<ref name=Turner2006/> Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include [[constipation]], low-grade [[acidosis]], and [[hypoglycaemia]] if an initial fast is undertaken. [[Hyperlipidemia|Raised levels of lipids in the blood]] affect up to 60% of children<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> and [[Hypercholesterolemia|cholesterol levels may increase]] by around 30%.<ref name=Turner2006/> This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many [[micronutrient]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nLong-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and [[kidney stone]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> The diet reduces levels of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]] ([[topiramate]], [[zonisamide]]) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone.<ref name=Sampath2007/> The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet.<ref name=Sampath2007/> Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral [[potassium citrate]] supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in one-seventh of the incidence of kidney stones.<ref name=McNally2009/> However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Excess calcium in the urine ([[hypercalciuria]]) occurs due to increased bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones are mainly composed of [[calcium phosphate]]. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Hypocitraturia: the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* The urine has a low pH, which stops [[uric acid]] from dissolving, leading to crystals that act as a [[wikt:nidus|nidus]] for calcium stone formation.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80% of normal daily needs;<ref name=Sampath2007/> this practice is no longer encouraged.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nIn adolescent and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, [[dyslipidemia]], and in women, [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name=Kossoff2006/>\n\n==Implementation==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[medical nutrition therapy]] that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric [[dietitian]] who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric [[neurologist]] who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a [[registered nurse]] who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a [[medical social worker]] who works with the family and a [[pharmacist]] who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nImplementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.<ref name=Vogelstein2010/>\n\n===Initiation===\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted.<ref name=Kim2008/> It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nAt the initial consultation, patients are [[screening (medicine)|screened]] for conditions that may [[contraindicate]] the diet. A dietary [[medical history|history]] is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nThe day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/> are allowed until dinner, which consists of \"[[eggnog]]\"<ref name=Eggnog group=Note/> restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the \"eggnog\" dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal's caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not \"eggnog\"). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nWhen in the hospital, [[blood sugar|glucose levels]] are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic [[ketosis]] (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks.<ref name=Vining1998/> The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/>\n\nVariations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using [[outpatient]] clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of [[metabolic acidosis|acidosis]], hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nFor patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/> Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Maintenance===\nAfter initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital [[dietitian]]<ref name=Hartman2007b/> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> [[ketonuria|Urinary ketone levels]] are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> This is performed using ketone test strips containing [[nitroprusside]], which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).<ref name=Musa-Veloso2004/>\n\nA short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if [[ketone]] levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even \"sugar-free\" food can contain carbohydrates such as [[maltodextrin]], [[sorbitol]], [[starch]], and [[fructose]]. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\n===Discontinuation===\nAbout 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions.<ref name=Martinez2007/> This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nChildren who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30\u201350% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an [[electroencephalogram]]  shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an [[MRI scan]] shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with [[tuberous sclerosis]]). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.<ref name=Martinez2007/>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Ketogenic diets pie MCT.svg|thumb|alt=A series of four pie charts for the typical American diet, the induction phase of the Atkins diet, the classic ketogenic diet, and the MCD ketogenic diet. The typical American diet has about half its calories from carbohydrates, where the others have very little carbohydrate. The Atkins diet is higher in protein than the others. Most of the fat in the MCT diet comes from MCT oil.|The ratio of calorific contributions from food components of four diets, by weight]]\n\nThe ketogenic diet is calculated by a [[dietitian]] for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80\u201390% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle [[spasticity]] require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18&nbsp;months, older than 12&nbsp;years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9&nbsp;kcal/g (38&nbsp;kJ/g) compared to 4&nbsp;kcal/g (17&nbsp;kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1&nbsp;g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or [[dietary supplement|supplements]] must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nA computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008b/> The meals often have four components: [[cream|heavy whipping cream]], a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic [[weighing scale|scale]] accurate to 1&nbsp;g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nThe classic ketogenic diet is not a [[balanced diet]] and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, [[Food fortification|fortified]] cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the [[B vitamins]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]] must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient's age: a [[multivitamin]] with [[Dietary mineral|minerals]] and [[calcium]] with vitamin D.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500&nbsp;kcal (6,300&nbsp;kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:<ref name=Turner2006/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Sample meal plan for one day\n!Meal\n!Menu idea\n!Ingredients\n|-\n|Breakfast\n|Egg with bacon\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g egg (about half an egg)\n* 11&nbsp;g bacon (about half a slice)\n* 37&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 23&nbsp;g butter\n* 9&nbsp;g slice of apple (about 5% of one apple)\n|-\n|Morning snack\n|Peanut butter ball\n(serving size: 0.5&nbsp;ounce)\n|\n* 6&nbsp;g peanut butter\n* 9&nbsp;g butter\n|-\n|Lunch\n|Tuna salad\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g tuna fish\n* 30&nbsp;g mayonnaise\n* 10&nbsp;g celery\n* 36&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 15&nbsp;g lettuce (one large leaf)\n|-\n|Afternoon snack\n|Keto yogurt\n(serving size: 1.3&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 18&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 17&nbsp;g sour cream\n* 4&nbsp;g strawberries (about half of one small strawberry)\n* [[artificial sweetener]]\n|-\n|Dinner\n|Cheeseburger (no bun)\n|\n* 22&nbsp;g [[Ground beef|minced (ground) beef]]\n* 10&nbsp;g [[American cheese]] (half a slice of cheese)\n* 26&nbsp;g butter\n* 38&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 10&nbsp;g lettuce (one medium leaf)\n* 11&nbsp;g green beans (one spoonful)\n|-\n|Evening snack\n|Keto custard\n(serving size: 1.2&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 25&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 9&nbsp;g egg (half a [[tablespoon]])\n* Pure, unsweetened vanilla flavouring\n|}\n\n===MCT oil===\nNormal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). [[Medium-chain triglycerides]] (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate,<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes.<ref name=Liu2008/> The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by [[health insurance|insurance companies]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Modified Atkins===\nFirst reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10&nbsp;g per day in children or 20&nbsp;g per day in adults, and are increased to 20\u201330&nbsp;g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/>\n\nThe modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/> Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favorably with the traditional ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Low glycemic index treatment===\nThe low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)<ref name=Pfeifer2013/> is an attempt to achieve the stable [[blood glucose]] levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet,<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat),<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40\u201360&nbsp;g per day.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nShort-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/><ref name=Muzykewicz2009/>\n\n===Prescribed formulations===\n[[File:Measuring Ketocal.jpg|thumb|alt=A cream-coloured powder is poured from a tin into a measuring jug on an electronic kitchen scale.|Measuring KetoCal\u2014a powdered formula for administering the classic ketogenic diet]]\nInfants and patients fed via a [[Feeding tube|gastrostomy tube]] can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/> Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total [[cholesterol]] than a solid ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> KetoCal is a [[Enteral formula|nutritionally complete food]] containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding.<ref name=KetoCal/> Other formula products include KetoVolve<ref name=KetoVolve/> and Ketonia.<ref name=KetoBottle/> Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.<ref name=KetoBottle/>\n\n===Worldwide===\nThere are theoretically no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory, so calculating macronutrients such as fat, protein and carbohydrates can be difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn Asia, the traditional diet includes rice and noodles as the main source of energy, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians and will not eat root vegetables and will try to avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.<ref name=Kossoff2008b/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\n\n===Seizure pathology===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = [[Ketone bodies]]\n\n | image1 = beta-Hydroxybutyric acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = Skeletal formula of 3-hydroxybutyric acid\n | caption1 = [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]]\n\n | image2 = Acetoacetic acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | alt2 = Skeletal formula of 3-oxobutanoic acid\n | caption2 = [[acetoacetic acid]]\n\n | image3 = Acetone-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width3 = 75\n | alt3 = Skeletal formula of acetone\n | caption3 = [[acetone]]\n}}\nThe brain is composed of a network of [[Neurotransmission|neurons that transmit signals]] by propagating [[nerve impulse]]s. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by [[neurotransmitter]]s, though there are also [[Electrical synapse|electrical pathways]] between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|\u03b3-aminobutyric acid]], or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by [[glutamate]]). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThe nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through [[Voltage-gated sodium channel|channels]] in the neuron's [[cell membrane]] followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]), which is mediated by another [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|potassium channel]]. The flow through these [[ion channel]]s is governed by a \"gate\" which is opened by either a voltage change or a [[Ligand-gated ion channel|chemical messenger]] known as a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThere are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n===Seizure control===\nAlthough many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include [[Metabolic acidosis|systemic acidosis]] (high levels of acid in the blood), [[Electrolyte disturbance|electrolyte changes]] and [[hypoglycaemia]] (low [[blood glucose]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nOn the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty-acid oxidation]] in the cell's [[mitochondria]] (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some [[amino acid]]s into glucose by a process called [[gluconeogenesis]], but cannot do this by using fatty acids.<ref name=Kerndt1982/> Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three [[ketone bodies]] [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]] and [[acetone]]. These ketone bodies enter the brain and ''partially'' substitute for [[blood glucose]] as a source of energy.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in [[animal model]]s, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the [[neuron]]s to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a [[neuroprotective]] effect.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant.  Conversely, [[fenofibrate]], not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental [[anticonvulsant]] properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Porta2009/>  This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nAnticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants ([[valproate]], [[levetiracetam]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\n==Other applications==\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[autism]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\nBecause some cancer cells are [[Warburg effect (oncology)|inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy]], the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer.<ref name=\"Baranano2008\" /><ref name=\"Allen2014\" />  A 2018 review looked at the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy. The clinical studies in humans are typically very small, with some providing weak evidence for anti-tumour effect, particularly for [[glioblastoma]], but in other cancers and studies, no anti-tumour effect was seen. Taken together, results from preclinical studies, albeit sometimes contradictory, tend to support an anti-tumor effect rather than a pro-tumor effect of the KD for most solid cancers.<ref name=Weber2018/>\n\nThe evidence of benefit for these conditions has not reached the level where clinical recommendations can be made.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Atkins diet]] \u2013 brand of low-carbohydrate diet\n* [[Ketosis]] \u2013 metabolic process that uses fats as an energy source\n* [[List of diets]]\n* [[Low-carbohydrate diet]] \u2013 varieties of diets that focus on reducing carbohydrates\n* [[Medium-chain triglyceride]] \u2013 easily absorbed, naturally occurring type of fat \n* [[Fad diet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em|group=Note|refs=\n{{#tag:ref|Ketogenic \"eggnog\" is used during induction and is a drink with the required ketogenic ratio.

{"title_page": "Midrasha", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}\nA '''''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4}}, pl. ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') refers to an institute of [[Torah study|Jewish studies]] for women. In [[Israel]], it is often an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. The term is often translated as '[[seminary]]'.{{fact|date=October 2014}} \n\nIn [[Israel]], a midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' (institute). Some ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}''  accept both men and women, such as the Ein Prat Midrasha<ref>[http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html Eni Prat Midrasha Bogrim.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101012427/http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref> in Israel.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the term has also been used to refer to co-educational Jewish studies programs, allowing high school students to continue their Jewish education post [[bar mitzvah|bar]] / [[bat mitzvah]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\n==Structure==\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Ethics (Musar)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']].

The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816.\n\nDavid Ochterlony and British political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as [[Irregular military|irregular forces]]. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George\u2019s Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\". \n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony\u2019s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lt. Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion\u2014the Kumaon\u2014was also raised, eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\nGurkhas served as troops under contract to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in the [[Pindaree War]] of 1817, in [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] in 1826 and the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10782099 |title= Who are the Gurkhas?|date=27 July 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the [[British Indian Army]] on its formation. The [[2nd Gurkha Rifles|8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion]] made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 [[Indian Order of Merit]] awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=58}} \n\nThree days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=57}} Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended [[Raja Hindu Rao|Hindu Rao]]'s house, losing 327 out of 490 men.

They discouraged the Brahminical influence in the military as they considered the Hindu castes more susceptible to Brahminical values.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} As a result, they discouraged the inclusion of [[Thakuri]] and [[Khas]] groups in the Gorkha units{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} and refused to recruit tribes other than [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]] in the Gorkha units.{{sfn|Singh|1997|pp=220\u2013221}} They also pressurized Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] to include at least of 75% of the forces of [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]].{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}}\n\nBetween 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=79}}\n\n[[File:5thRoyalGurkhaRiflesNorth-WestFrontier1923.JPG|thumb|left|2nd/5th [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], North-West Frontier 1923.]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions.\n\nA large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=9}} They served on the battlefields of [[France]] in the battles of [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]]; in [[Belgium]] at the battle of [[Ypres]]; in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Suez Canal]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] against Turkish advance, [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=99}} One detachment served with [[Lawrence of Arabia]]. During the Battle of Loos (June\u2013December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defences, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, \"found its Valhalla\".<ref>Sengupta 2007.</ref> \n\nDuring the ultimately unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as \"Gurkha Bluff\".{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=121}} The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of [[Baghdad]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=150}} \n\nAs such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the [[Third Afghan War]] in 1919.

Commissioned officers within the Gurkha regiments held a ''Viceroy's Commission'', which was distinct from the King's or Queen's Commission that British officers serving with a Gurkha regiment held.

After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King's (later Queen's) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King's/Queen's Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.\n* [[Jemadar]]s and [[subedar]]s normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer's advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.\n* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King's Indian Commissions, and later full King's or Queen's Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers. This was rare until after the Second World War.\n* Gurkha officers commissioned from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and Short Service Officers regularly fill appointments up to the rank of major. At least two Gurkhas have been promoted to lieutenant colonel and there is theoretically now no bar to further progression.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* After 1948, the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] (part of the British Army) was formed and adopted standard British Army rank structure and nomenclature, except for the three Viceroy Commission ranks between Warrant Officer 1 and Second Lieutenant (jemadar, subedar and subedar major) which remained, albeit with different rank titles Lieutenant (Queens Gurkha Officer), Captain (QGO) and Major (QGO). The QGO commission was abolished in 2007; Gurkha soldiers are currently commissioned as Late Entry Officers (as above).<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n\n=== Regiments of the Gurkha Rifles (c.&nbsp;1815\u20131947) ===\n[[File:Gurkha Memorial, Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial of [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]], [[Winchester Cathedral]], [[Hampshire]]]]\n[[File:Princess Mary's Own.JPG|thumb|Princess Mary's Own|300px]]\n\n* [[1GR|1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]] (raised 1815, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[3GR|3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[4 Gorkha Rifles|4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1857, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[5GR|5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] (raised 1858, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[6th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1817, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[7th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1902, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[8th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[9th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1890, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[11th Gurkha Rifles]] (1918\u20131922; raised again by India{{snd}}[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]{{snd}}following independence in 1947)\n* [[25th Gurkha Rifles]] (1942\u20131946)\n* [[26th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[29th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[42nd Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817 as the [[Cuttack Legion]], renamed 6th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n* [[44th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824 as the [[16th (Sylhet) Local Battalion]], renamed 8th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n\n=== Second World War training battalions ===\n* 14th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 29th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion\n* 38th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 56th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 710th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\">{{cite web|accessdate=19 October 2009 | publisher = Order of Battle|title=115 Infantry Brigade Subordanates|url = http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=63267&Tab=Sub}}</ref>\n\n== Post-independence (1947\u2013present) ==\n[[File:Gurkha inscription.JPG|thumb|\n<center>\nTHE GURKHA<br />\nSOLDIER<br />\n''Bravest of the brave,''<br />\n''most generous of the generous,''<br />\n''never had country''<br />\n''more faithful friends''<br />\n''than you.''<br />\n<small>Professor Sir [[Ralph Turner]] MC<ref>The inscription on a monument to Gurkha soldiers which was unveiled in 1997 in [[Whitehall]], [[London]] (Staff.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1997/gurkhas/36397.stm The Gurkhas&nbsp;\u2013 Britain's oldest allies] BBC, 4 December 1997).</ref></small>\n</center>]]\n\nAfter [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], and the [[partition of India]], in 1947 and under the [[Britain-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tripartite Agreement]], the original ten Gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the British Army and the newly independent [[Indian Army]].<ref name=\"Cross32\" /> Six Gurkha regiments (12 battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=224}}\n\nTo the disappointment of their British officers, the majority of Gurkhas given a choice between British or Indian Army service opted for the latter. The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=226}} The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]; a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}}\n\nThe principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=322\u2013323}} This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=323}}\n\nWith the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepalese people]] and would be banned.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=344}} However, as of 2018, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.\n\n===British Army Gurkhas===\n{{Main article|Brigade of Gurkhas}}\n[[File:Gurkhas on Patrol in Helmand MOD 45151723.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles on patrol in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2010.]]\nFour Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]]\n* [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n\nThey formed the '''Brigade of Gurkhas''' and were initially stationed in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]].

In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join, although not in first-line units, conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in the UK for retired Gurkhas and their families.\n\nDespite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement.

The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816.\n\nDavid Ochterlony and British political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as [[Irregular military|irregular forces]]. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George\u2019s Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\". \n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony\u2019s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lt. Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion\u2014the Kumaon\u2014was also raised, eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\nGurkhas served as troops under contract to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in the [[Pindaree War]] of 1817, in [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] in 1826 and the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10782099 |title= Who are the Gurkhas?|date=27 July 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the [[British Indian Army]] on its formation. The [[2nd Gurkha Rifles|8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion]] made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 [[Indian Order of Merit]] awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=58}} \n\nThree days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=57}} Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended [[Raja Hindu Rao|Hindu Rao]]'s house, losing 327 out of 490 men.

They discouraged the Brahminical influence in the military as they considered the Hindu castes more susceptible to Brahminical values.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} As a result, they discouraged the inclusion of [[Thakuri]] and [[Khas]] groups in the Gorkha units{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} and refused to recruit tribes other than [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]] in the Gorkha units.{{sfn|Singh|1997|pp=220\u2013221}} They also pressurized Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] to include at least of 75% of the forces of [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]].{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}}\n\nBetween 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=79}}\n\n[[File:5thRoyalGurkhaRiflesNorth-WestFrontier1923.JPG|thumb|left|2nd/5th [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], North-West Frontier 1923.]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions.\n\nA large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=9}} They served on the battlefields of [[France]] in the battles of [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]]; in [[Belgium]] at the battle of [[Ypres]]; in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Suez Canal]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] against Turkish advance, [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=99}} One detachment served with [[Lawrence of Arabia]]. During the Battle of Loos (June\u2013December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defences, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, \"found its Valhalla\".<ref>Sengupta 2007.</ref> \n\nDuring the ultimately unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as \"Gurkha Bluff\".{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=121}} The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of [[Baghdad]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=150}} \n\nAs such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the [[Third Afghan War]] in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in [[Waziristan]], where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile [[Pashtun people|Pathan tribesmen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} \n\nDuring this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna saw an extensive amount of action.<ref>For more detail see {{harvnb|Barthorp|2002|p=}}.{{page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghurkas in action with a 6-pdr anti-tank gun in Tunisia, 16 March 1943.

Any Gurkha holding a commission was technically subordinate to any British officer, regardless of rank.<ref name=\"Cross34\">Cross & Gurung 2002, p. 34.</ref>\n\n[[File:5th Gurkha Rifles, Japan 1946.jpg|thumb|The 2/5th Royal Gurkha Rifles marching through Kure soon after their arrival in Japan in May 1946 as part of the Allied forces of occupation]]\n\n====British Indian Army and current Indian Army ranks/current British Army equivalents====\n'''Viceroy Commissioned Officers (VCOs) up to 1947 and Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) from 1947:<ref>Source: Cross & Gurung 2002, pp.&nbsp;33\u201334</ref>'''\n* [[Subedar Major]]/no equivalent\n* [[Subedar]]/no equivalent\n* [[Jemadar]] (now [[Naib Subedar]])/no equivalent\n\n'''Warrant officers'''\n* [[Regimental Havildar Major]]/[[Regimental Sergeant Major]]\n* [[Company Havildar Major]]/[[Company Sergeant Major]]\n\n'''Non-commissioned officers'''\n* [[Company Quartermaster Havildar]]/[[Company Quartermaster Sergeant]]\n* [[Havildar]]/[[Sergeant]]\n* [[Naik (military rank)|Naik]]/[[Corporal]]\n* [[Lance Naik]]/[[Lance Corporal]]\n\n'''Private soldiers'''\n* [[Rifleman]]\n\n'''Notes'''\n* British Army officers received Queen's or King's Commissions, but Gurkha officers in this system received the Viceroy's Commission. After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King's (later Queen's) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King's/Queen's Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.\n* [[Jemadar]]s and [[subedar]]s normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer's advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.\n* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King's Indian Commissions, and later full King's or Queen's Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers. This was rare until after the Second World War.\n* Gurkha officers commissioned from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and Short Service Officers regularly fill appointments up to the rank of major. At least two Gurkhas have been promoted to lieutenant colonel and there is theoretically now no bar to further progression.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* After 1948, the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] (part of the British Army) was formed and adopted standard British Army rank structure and nomenclature, except for the three Viceroy Commission ranks between Warrant Officer 1 and Second Lieutenant (jemadar, subedar and subedar major) which remained, albeit with different rank titles Lieutenant (Queens Gurkha Officer), Captain (QGO) and Major (QGO). The QGO commission was abolished in 2007; Gurkha soldiers are currently commissioned as Late Entry Officers (as above).<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n\n=== Regiments of the Gurkha Rifles (c.&nbsp;1815\u20131947) ===\n[[File:Gurkha Memorial, Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial of [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]], [[Winchester Cathedral]], [[Hampshire]]]]\n[[File:Princess Mary's Own.JPG|thumb|Princess Mary's Own|300px]]\n\n* [[1GR|1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]] (raised 1815, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[3GR|3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[4 Gorkha Rifles|4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1857, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[5GR|5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] (raised 1858, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[6th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1817, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[7th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1902, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[8th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[9th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1890, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[11th Gurkha Rifles]] (1918\u20131922; raised again by India{{snd}}[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]{{snd}}following independence in 1947)\n* [[25th Gurkha Rifles]] (1942\u20131946)\n* [[26th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[29th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[42nd Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817 as the [[Cuttack Legion]], renamed 6th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n* [[44th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824 as the [[16th (Sylhet) Local Battalion]], renamed 8th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n\n=== Second World War training battalions ===\n* 14th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 29th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion\n* 38th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 56th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 710th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\">{{cite web|accessdate=19 October 2009 | publisher = Order of Battle|title=115 Infantry Brigade Subordanates|url = http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=63267&Tab=Sub}}</ref>\n\n== Post-independence (1947\u2013present) ==\n[[File:Gurkha inscription.JPG|thumb|\n<center>\nTHE GURKHA<br />\nSOLDIER<br />\n''Bravest of the brave,''<br />\n''most generous of the generous,''<br />\n''never had country''<br />\n''more faithful friends''<br />\n''than you.''<br />\n<small>Professor Sir [[Ralph Turner]] MC<ref>The inscription on a monument to Gurkha soldiers which was unveiled in 1997 in [[Whitehall]], [[London]] (Staff.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1997/gurkhas/36397.stm The Gurkhas&nbsp;\u2013 Britain's oldest allies] BBC, 4 December 1997).</ref></small>\n</center>]]\n\nAfter [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], and the [[partition of India]], in 1947 and under the [[Britain-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tripartite Agreement]], the original ten Gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the British Army and the newly independent [[Indian Army]].<ref name=\"Cross32\" /> Six Gurkha regiments (12 battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=224}}\n\nTo the disappointment of their British officers, the majority of Gurkhas given a choice between British or Indian Army service opted for the latter. The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=226}} The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]; a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}}\n\nThe principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=322\u2013323}} This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=323}}\n\nWith the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepalese people]] and would be banned.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=344}} However, as of 2018, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.\n\n===British Army Gurkhas===\n{{Main article|Brigade of Gurkhas}}\n[[File:Gurkhas on Patrol in Helmand MOD 45151723.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles on patrol in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2010.]]\nFour Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]]\n* [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n\nThey formed the '''Brigade of Gurkhas''' and were initially stationed in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]].

In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join, although not in first-line units, conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in the UK for retired Gurkhas and their families.\n\nDespite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement.

Most of IMRO\u2019s founders and principal organizers were graduates of the Bulgarian Exarchate schools in Macedonia, who had become teachers and inspectors in the same system that had educated them. Frustrated with the pace of change, they organized and networked to develop their movement throughout the Bulgarian school system that employed them. The Exarchate schools were an ideal forum in which to propagate their cause, and the leading members were able to circulate to different posts, to spread the word, and to build up supplies and stores for the anticipated uprising. As it became more powerful, IMRO was able to impress upon the Exarchate its wishes for teacher and inspector appointments in Macedonia.

However, the ''Narrows'' denounced the [[Ilinden uprising]] as an adventure inspired by the Bulgarian government, that played into the hands of the Great Powers. In 1904, Karev made a legal attempt to return to Macedonia, taking advantage of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Amnesty Agreement for the participants in the Ilinden Uprising.

('''in English''') Eleftheria Vambakovska: As to the content of the interview, I leave it free for interpretations by scientists and readers. My opinion is that it contains contradictory and illogical claims. The interview actually begins with an illogical claim. Karev asserts he is a Bulgarian by conviction (\"Bulgarophronos\"), and on the first question of the reporter: \"Are you a Macedonian\", he answers with \"yes\"! The reporter declared Karev was a Macedonian, but [[bulgarization|bulgarized]] one. The interview begins with a question \"are you a Macedonian\"? that means Karev's ethnic origin was more important for the interviewer \u2013 whether he is a \"Macedonian\", which to the Greeks was a synonymous of a \"Greek\". Otherwise, to the Greeks \"(Bulgarian) by conviction\" was not so important \u2013 the conviction is acquirable and it can by changed. \"Bulgarophronos\", literally translated would mean \u2013 a man who thinks like a Bulgarian, a man who thinks like all other Bulgarians. Today the Greeks have a similar term \u2013 ''ethnicophronos'', which has similar meaning, namely \u2013 a man who thinks on his own nation \u2013 nationalist,  a Greek who thinks about Greece.

This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian.

For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between \u2018Macedonians\u2019 and \u2018Bulgarians\u2019.

Meanwhile, most emphasis was placed on celebrating the joint Yugoslav history of the World War II Communist struggle.

('''in English''') Eleftheria Vambakovska: As to the content of the interview, I leave it free for interpretations by scientists and readers. My opinion is that it contains contradictory and illogical claims. The interview actually begins with an illogical claim. Karev asserts he is a Bulgarian by conviction (\"Bulgarophronos\"), and on the first question of the reporter: \"Are you a Macedonian\", he answers with \"yes\"! The reporter declared Karev was a Macedonian, but [[bulgarization|bulgarized]] one. The interview begins with a question \"are you a Macedonian\"? that means Karev's ethnic origin was more important for the interviewer \u2013 whether he is a \"Macedonian\", which to the Greeks was a synonymous of a \"Greek\". Otherwise, to the Greeks \"(Bulgarian) by conviction\" was not so important \u2013 the conviction is acquirable and it can by changed. \"Bulgarophronos\", literally translated would mean \u2013 a man who thinks like a Bulgarian, a man who thinks like all other Bulgarians. Today the Greeks have a similar term \u2013 ''ethnicophronos'', which has similar meaning, namely \u2013 a man who thinks on his own nation \u2013 nationalist,  a Greek who thinks about Greece.

This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian.

For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between \u2018Macedonians\u2019 and \u2018Bulgarians\u2019.

Meanwhile, most emphasis was placed on celebrating the joint Yugoslav history of the World War II Communist struggle.
