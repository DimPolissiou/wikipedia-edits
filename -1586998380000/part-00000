Between the two faces juts a massive prow. While today there are numerous established routes on both faces, the most popular and historically famous route is ''The Nose'', which follows the massive prow.\n\n==First ascents==\nOnce thought to be unclimbable, the high granite walls of Yosemite Valley began to see their first attempts and first ascents in the late 1950s. One of the most coveted routes was the [[Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome|Northwest Face of Half Dome]], and among those coveting it was Californian [[Warren Harding (climber)|Warren Harding]]. He made an unsuccessful attempt on Half Dome in 1955, and returned for the 1957 season just as [[Royal Robbins]] and team were completing the first ascent. \"My congratulations,\" Harding recounted, \"were hearty and sincere, but inside, the ambitious dreamer in me was troubled.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Doug Scott |title=Big Wall Climbing |url=https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot/page/147 147]}}</ref>\n\nHarding turned to an even larger unclimbed face, the {{convert|2900|ft|m|-2}} prow of El Capitan, at the other end of the valley. With Mark Powell and Bill \"Dolt\" Feuerer, they began the climb in July 1957. Rather than follow the single-push \"alpine\" style used on Half Dome, they chose to fix lines between \"camps\" in the style used in the Himalaya. Attempting to get half way on the first push, they were foiled by the huge cracks, and Feuerer was required to form new rock spikes or [[piton]]s by cutting off the legs of wood stoves. This gave the name to the crack system leading to the half way point, the \"stove leg cracks\".\n\nCompelled by the National Park Service to stop until March due to the crowds forming in El Capitan meadows as soon as the snow melts, the team had a major setback when Powell suffered a compound leg fracture on another climbing trip. Waits at the base of The Nose and Korengals easily reach 50 hours. Powell dropped out, and Feuerer became disillusioned. Harding, true to his legendary endurance and willingness to find new partners, \"continued\", as he later put it, \"with whatever 'qualified' climbers I could con into this rather unpromising venture.\"<ref name=AAJ>{{cite journal |author=Warren Harding |title=El Capitan |journal=American Alpine Journal |year=1959 |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/documents/pdf/aaj/1959/184_Harding_ElCapitan_aaj1959.pdf}}</ref>  Feuerer stayed on as technical advisor, even constructing a bicycle wheeled cart which could be hauled up to the half-way ledge which bears his name today, \"Dolt Tower\"; but Wayne Merry, George Whitmore, and Rich Calderwood now became the main team, with Merry sharing lead chores with Harding.\n\nIn the fall, two more pushes got them to the {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} level. Finally, a fourth push starting in the late fall would likely be the last. The team had originally fixed their route with {{convert|1/2|in|mm|0}} manila lines, and their in situ lines would have weakened more over the winter. In the cooling November environment, they worked their way slowly upward, the seven days it took to push to within the last {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}} blurring into a \"monotonous grind\" if, Harding adds, \"living and working {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}} above the ground on a granite face\" could be considered monotonous.<ref name=AAJ/>  After sitting out a storm for three days at this level, they hammered their way up the final portion. Harding struggled fifteen hours through the night, hand-placed 28 expansion bolts up an overhanging headwall before topping out at 6&nbsp;AM. The complete climb had taken 45 days, with more than {{convert|3400|ft|m|-2}} of climbing including huge pendulum swings across the face, the labor of hauling bags, and rappel descents.\n\nThe team had finished what is by any standard one of the classics of modern rock climbing. The Nose Route is often called the most famous rock climbing route in North America, and in good fall weather can have anywhere between three and ten different parties strung out along its thirty rope lengths to the top. On the 50th anniversary of the ascent, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the achievement of the original party.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Doyle |title=House Honors First Climbers to Scale El Capitan |publisher=McClatchy News Service |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/53336.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509194756/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/01/53336/house-honors-first-climbers-to.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe second ascent was made in 1960 by [[Royal Robbins]], [[Joe Fitschen]], [[Chuck Pratt]] and [[Tom Frost]], who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics.<ref name=fifty/> The first [[roped solo climbing|rope-solo climb]] of The Nose was made by Tom Bauman in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mountaineering in Patagonia |author=Alan Kearney |page=67 |year=1993 |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |isbn=0-938567-30-6}}</ref> The first ascent of ''The Nose'' in one day was accomplished in 1975 by [[John Long (climber)|John Long]], [[Jim Bridwell]] and [[Billy Westbay]].

In 1993, [[Lynn Hill]] came close to freeing ''The Nose'', making it past the ''Great Roof'' and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on ''Changing Corners'' by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold.<ref name=McNamara/> After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground. After 4 days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb ''The Nose''.

Harding, true to his legendary endurance and willingness to find new partners, \"continued\", as he later put it, \"with whatever 'qualified' climbers I could con into this rather unpromising venture.\"<ref name=AAJ>{{cite journal |author=Warren Harding |title=El Capitan |journal=American Alpine Journal |year=1959 |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/documents/pdf/aaj/1959/184_Harding_ElCapitan_aaj1959.pdf}}</ref>  Feuerer stayed on as technical advisor, even constructing a bicycle wheeled cart which could be hauled up to the half-way ledge which bears his name today, \"Dolt Tower\"; but Wayne Merry, George Whitmore, and Rich Calderwood now became the main team, with Merry sharing lead chores with Harding.\n\nIn the fall, two more pushes got them to the {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} level. Finally, a fourth push starting in the late fall would likely be the last. The team had originally fixed their route with {{convert|1/2|in|mm|0}} manila lines, and their in situ lines would have weakened more over the winter. In the cooling November environment, they worked their way slowly upward, the seven days it took to push to within the last {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}} blurring into a \"monotonous grind\" if, Harding adds, \"living and working {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}} above the ground on a granite face\" could be considered monotonous.<ref name=AAJ/>  After sitting out a storm for three days at this level, they hammered their way up the final portion. Harding struggled fifteen hours through the night, hand-placed 28 expansion bolts up an overhanging headwall before topping out at 6&nbsp;AM. The complete climb had taken 45 days, with more than {{convert|3400|ft|m|-2}} of climbing including huge pendulum swings across the face, the labor of hauling bags, and rappel descents.\n\nThe team had finished what is by any standard one of the classics of modern rock climbing. The Nose Route is often called the most famous rock climbing route in North America, and in good fall weather can have anywhere between three and ten different parties strung out along its thirty rope lengths to the top. On the 50th anniversary of the ascent, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the achievement of the original party.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Doyle |title=House Honors First Climbers to Scale El Capitan |publisher=McClatchy News Service |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/53336.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509194756/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/01/53336/house-honors-first-climbers-to.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe second ascent was made in 1960 by [[Royal Robbins]], [[Joe Fitschen]], [[Chuck Pratt]] and [[Tom Frost]], who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics.<ref name=fifty/> The first [[roped solo climbing|rope-solo climb]] of The Nose was made by Tom Bauman in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mountaineering in Patagonia |author=Alan Kearney |page=67 |year=1993 |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |isbn=0-938567-30-6}}</ref> The first ascent of ''The Nose'' in one day was accomplished in 1975 by [[John Long (climber)|John Long]], [[Jim Bridwell]] and [[Billy Westbay]].

The \"West Face\" route was free climbed in 1979 by [[Ray Jardine]] and [[Bill Price (rock climber)|Bill Price]]; but despite numerous efforts by Jardine and others, ''The Nose'' resisted free attempts for another fourteen years.\n\nThe first free ascent of a main El Cap route, though, was not ''The Nose'', but ''[[Salathe Wall (El Capitan)|The Salathe Wall]]''.

In 1993, [[Lynn Hill]] came close to freeing ''The Nose'', making it past the ''Great Roof'' and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on ''Changing Corners'' by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold.<ref name=McNamara/> After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground. After 4 days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb ''The Nose''.

The Call of Duty League follows the model of the [[Overwatch League]] as well as other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. In addition, the league plays in a tournament point system and [[playoffs]] format rather than the use of [[promotion and relegation]] used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team performs. The League was announced in 2019 with its inaugural season starting in 2020. The events are hosted by teams in their home cities, beginning with the Launch Weekend event hosted by the Minnesota ROKKR and taking place in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 24\u201326, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hume |first1=Mike |last2=Klimentov |first2=Mikhail |title=Call of Duty League to start 2020 season in Minnesota Jan. 24 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2019/10/29/call-duty-league-start-season-minnesota-jan/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |date=October 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rand |first1=Emily |title=Call of Duty League opener was not the disaster that social media advertised |url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28557181/call-duty-league-opener-was-not-disaster-social-media-advertised |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=ESPN |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Pei |first1=Annie |title=Activision Blizzard's next esports bet hinges on the power of the Call of Duty franchise |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/activision-blizzard-is-kicks-off-their-call-of-duty-esports-league.html |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=CNBC |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe Call of Duty League is owned by [[Activision Blizzard]] as that company's second franchise-based esports organization. The league plays out similar to most North American professional sports leagues, in which all teams play scheduled games against other teams to vie for position in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team [[promotion and relegation]] more commonly used in other esports leagues. The league currently features twelve teams.<ref name=\"Business Insider\">{{cite news |last1=Webb |first1=Kevin |title=12 teams reportedly paid $25 million each to join a new esports league that starts today \u2014 here's everything you need to know about Call of Duty League |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-duty-league-teams-schedule-salary-rules-format-2019-11 |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=Business Insider |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEach match between two teams consists of a best-of-five through different games based on gameplay modes and maps within the ''Call of Duty'' game. The inaugural season used the 2019 release, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'', played on standard [[PlayStation 4]] consoles and other equivalent equipment for all players. The three multiplayer modes used by the CDL include: \"Search & Destroy\", where one team attempts to plant a bomb and defend it at one of two control points while the other team tries to eliminate the bomb team, or if the bomb is activated, to defuse it in time; \"Hardpoint\", where a rotation control point appears on the map, and teams earn points for maintaining control on that point; and \"Domination\", where three control points appear on the map, and teams are awarded points by maintaining control of one or more of these points. In the case of \"Search & Destroy\" and \"Domination\", multiple rounds are played, switching the role of each team, while \"Hardpoint\" is played until a point limit is reached. Once a team has won three games in a match, the match is over, and that team given the match victory.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/about | title = Call of Duty League - About | accessdate = January 27, 2020 | publisher = [[Activision Blizzard]] }}</ref> Coaches for teams have a limited number of [[time out (sport)|time outs]] which they can use during a game, and can substitute players during this time; this is in contrast to the OWL format where play substitutions may only occur between games.<ref name=\"thr cdl\"/>\n\nThe 2020 season schedule is evenly divided into two splits for spring and summer, with a mid-season all-star event taking place after the spring split, and culminates in the Championship Weekend.<ref name=\"Business Insider\" /> Each team will host a weekend tournament-style event in their home city, and the top teams from the weekend earns points.

The Call of Duty League follows the model of the [[Overwatch League]] as well as other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. In addition, the league plays in a tournament point system and [[playoffs]] format rather than the use of [[promotion and relegation]] used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team performs. The League was announced in 2019 with its inaugural season starting in 2020. The events are hosted by teams in their home cities, beginning with the Launch Weekend event hosted by the Minnesota ROKKR and taking place in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 24\u201326, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hume |first1=Mike |last2=Klimentov |first2=Mikhail |title=Call of Duty League to start 2020 season in Minnesota Jan. 24 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2019/10/29/call-duty-league-start-season-minnesota-jan/ |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |date=October 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rand |first1=Emily |title=Call of Duty League opener was not the disaster that social media advertised |url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28557181/call-duty-league-opener-was-not-disaster-social-media-advertised |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=ESPN |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Pei |first1=Annie |title=Activision Blizzard's next esports bet hinges on the power of the Call of Duty franchise |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/activision-blizzard-is-kicks-off-their-call-of-duty-esports-league.html |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=CNBC |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe Call of Duty League is owned by [[Activision Blizzard]] as that company's second franchise-based esports organization. The league plays out similar to most North American professional sports leagues, in which all teams play scheduled games against other teams to vie for position in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team [[promotion and relegation]] more commonly used in other esports leagues. The league currently features twelve teams.<ref name=\"Business Insider\">{{cite news |last1=Webb |first1=Kevin |title=12 teams reportedly paid $25 million each to join a new esports league that starts today \u2014 here's everything you need to know about Call of Duty League |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-duty-league-teams-schedule-salary-rules-format-2019-11 |accessdate=January 26, 2020 |work=Business Insider |date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEach match between two teams consists of a best-of-five through different games based on gameplay modes and maps within the ''Call of Duty'' game. The inaugural season used the 2019 release, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'', played on standard [[PlayStation 4]] consoles and other equivalent equipment for all players. The three multiplayer modes used by the CDL include: \"Search & Destroy\", where one team attempts to plant a bomb and defend it at one of two control points while the other team tries to eliminate the bomb team, or if the bomb is activated, to defuse it in time; \"Hardpoint\", where a rotation control point appears on the map, and teams earn points for maintaining control on that point; and \"Domination\", where three control points appear on the map, and teams are awarded points by maintaining control of one or more of these points. In the case of \"Search & Destroy\" and \"Domination\", multiple rounds are played, switching the role of each team, while \"Hardpoint\" is played until a point limit is reached. Once a team has won three games in a match, the match is over, and that team given the match victory.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/about | title = Call of Duty League - About | accessdate = January 27, 2020 | publisher = [[Activision Blizzard]] }}</ref> Coaches for teams have a limited number of [[time out (sport)|time outs]] which they can use during a game, and can substitute players during this time; this is in contrast to the OWL format where play substitutions may only occur between games.<ref name=\"thr cdl\"/>\n\nThe 2020 season schedule is evenly divided into two splits for spring and summer, with a mid-season all-star event taking place after the spring split, and culminates in the Championship Weekend.<ref name=\"Business Insider\" /> Each team will host a weekend tournament-style event in their home city, and the top teams from the weekend earns points.

At least 50% of the winnings a team earns must be shared with the team members. Players are not required to live in the city/region that the team represents.

The throne of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1438 until their extinction in the male line in 1740. The house also produced kings of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]]  with their respective colonies, as well as rulers of several principalities in the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] and Italy. From the 16th century, following the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.\n\nThe House takes its name from [[Habsburg Castle]], a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland, in the [[canton of Aargau]], by [[Radbot, Count of Habsburg|Count Radbot]] of [[Klettgau]], who named his fortress Habsburg. His grandson [[Otto II, Count of Habsburg|Otto II]] was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding \"Count of Habsburg\" to his title. The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries. In 1273, Count Radbot's seventh generation descendant [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] became [[List of German monarchs|Roman-German King]]. He moved the family's power base to the [[Duchy of Austria]], which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918.\n\nA series of dynastic marriages<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1851170|title = Dynastic Marriage in Sixteenth-Century Habsburg Diplomacy and Statecraft: An Interdisciplinary Approach|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 81|issue = 2|pages = 243\u2013265|last1 = Fichtner|first1 = Paula Sutter|year = 1976|doi = 10.2307/1851170}}</ref> enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and its colonial empire, Bohemia, Hungary, and other territories. In the 16th century, the family separated into the [[House of Habsburg#Division of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs|senior Spanish and the junior Austrian branches]], who settled their mutual claims in the [[O\u00f1ate treaty]].\n\nThe House of Habsburg became extinct in the male line in the 18th century. The senior Spanish branch ended upon the death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700 and was replaced by the [[House of Bourbon]]. The remaining Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]]. It was succeeded by the descendants of his eldest daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]'s marriage to [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis III, Duke of Lorraine]]. The successor house styled itself formally as the '''House of Habsburg-Lorraine''' (German: ''Habsburg-Lothringen''); because it was often still referred to as the House of Habsburg, historians use the [[wikt:appellation#English|appellation]] of the Habsburg Monarchy for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the family until 1918. \n\nAfter the First World War, the House of Habsburg was a vehement opponent of [[National Socialism]] and [[Communism]]. [[Hitler]] diametrically opposed the centuries-old Habsburg principles of \"live and let live\" in relation to ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages \u200b\u200band bristled with hatred against the Habsburg family. The Communists and Socialists as well as the [[USSR]] were strictly anti-Habsburg because they feared opposition in their oppressed countries during the [[Cold War]]. The Habsburg family played a leading role in the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]].\n\nThe House of Habsburg still exists today and its members use the name Habsburg, such as the current head of the family [[Karl von Habsburg]].\n\nThe Habsburg Empire had the advantage of size, but multiple disadvantages. There were rivals on four sides, its finances were unstable, the population was fragmented into multiple ethnicities, and its industrial base was thin. Its naval resources were so minimal that it did not attempt to build an overseas empire.

His grandson [[Radbot, Count of Habsburg]] founded the [[Habsburg Castle]], after which the Habsburgs are named. The origins of the castle's name, located in what is now the Swiss [[canton of Aargau]], are uncertain. There is disagreement on whether the name is derived from the [[High German]] ''Habichtsburg'' (hawk castle), or from the Middle High German word ''hab/hap'' meaning ''ford'', as there is a river with a ford nearby. The first documented use of the name by the dynasty itself has been traced to the year 1108.<ref>\"Habsburger-Gedenkjahr im Aargau\", ''[[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]]'', (page 17) 23 May 2008.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.art-tv.ch/1965-0-habsburger-gedenkjahr.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921142752/http://www.art-tv.ch/1965-0-habsburger-gedenkjahr.html|url-status=dead|title=art-tv.ch|archivedate=September 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.ch/staatsarchiv/de/pub/fokus/habsburger_gedenkjahr.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223234043/http://www.ag.ch/staatsarchiv/de/pub/fokus/habsburger_gedenkjahr.php |title=Kanton Aargau |archivedate=December 23, 2008|language=de}}</ref>\nThe Habsburg Castle was the [[family seat]] in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe Habsburgs expanded their influence through arranged marriages and by gaining political privileges, especially countship rights in [[Z\u00fcrichgau]], [[Aargau]] and [[Thurgau]]. In the 13th century, the house aimed its marriage policy at families in [[Upper Alsace]] and [[Swabia]]. They were also able to gain high positions in the church hierarchy for their members.

Due to these impressive preconditions, on 1 October 1273, Rudolph was chosen as the [[King of the Romans]] and received the name [[Rudolph I of Germany]].<ref name=heimann>'' Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. {{ISBN|3-406-44754-6}}.</ref>\n\nIn a crucial step towards the creation of his own power base in the [[Eastern Alps]], Rudolph led a coalition against king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] who had taken advantage of the [[Great Interregnum]] in order to expand southwards, taking over first the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] ([[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Mark an der Sann|Savinja]]), and then the [[House of Spanheim|Spanheim]] inheritance ([[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Carniola|Carniola]]). In 1278, Ottokar was defeated and killed in the [[Battle of Marchfeld]]. The lands he had acquired in the previous decades were reverted to the German crown. In 1282, the Habsburgs gained for themselves the rulership of the duchies of [[Georgenberg Pact|Austria and Styria]], which they then held for over 600 years, until 1918. The southern portions of Ottokar's former realm, Carinthia, Carniola, and Savinja, were granted to Rudolph's allies from the [[House of Gorizia]]. The resulting arrangement, known as the \"Habsburg-Gorizia equilibrium in the Eastern Alps\" lasted for half a decade.<ref>Milko Kos, ''Srednjeve\u0161ka kultur, dru\u017ebena in politi\u010dna zgodovina Slovencev'' (Ljubljana: Slovenska Matica, 1985), 260</ref><ref>France Dolinar & al, ''Slovenski zgodovinski atlas'' (Ljubljana: Nova revija, 2011), 72</ref>\n\nAfter Rudolph's death, the Habsburgs failed to maintain the Roman kingship. In the 1300s, their attempt to gain the Bohemian crown was frustrated first by [[Henry of Bohemia]] and finally by the [[House of Luxembourg]]. However, the weakening of the [[House of Gorizia]] in this succession struggle enabled them to expand southwards: in 1311, they took over the [[Mark an der Sann|Savinja]], and after the death of Henry of Bohemia in 1335, they assumed power in [[March of Carniola|Carniola]] and in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. In 1369, they would succeed [[Margaret Maultasch|his daughter]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], as well. After the death of [[Albert III of Gorizia]] in 1374, they gained their first foothold on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], in central [[Istria]] ([[Pazin|Mitterburg]]), followed by [[Trieste]] in 1382. The original home territories of the Habsburgs, the [[Aargau]] with Habsburg Castle and much of the other original possessions in what is now Switzerland were lost in the 14th century to the expanding [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] after the battles of [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]] (1315) and [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]] (1386). \n\nThrough the forged ''[[privilegium maius]]'' document (1358/59), a special bond was created between the House of Habsburg and Austria. The document, forged at the behest of [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]] (1339\u20131365), also attempted to introduce rules to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands. In the long term, this indeed succeeded, but Rudolph's brothers ignored the rule, leading to [[Treaty of Neuberg|the separation]] of the [[Albertinian Line|Albertian]] and [[Leopoldian line|Leopoldian]] family lines in 1379: the former would maintain Austria proper, while the latter would rule over Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, which became known as [[Inner Austria]], as well as Tyrol and the original Habsburg lands in Swabia, now known as [[Further Austria]].<ref name=heimann/>\n\nBy marrying [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg]], the daughter of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] in 1437, Duke [[Albert II of Germany|Albert V]] (1397\u20131439) of the Albertine line became the ruler of [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]], expanding the family's political horizons. The next year, Albert V was crowned as the King of the Romans as [[Albert II of Germany|Albert II]]. After his early death in war with the Turks in 1439, and after the death of his son [[Ladislaus Postumus]] in 1457, the Habsburgs lost Bohemia and Hungary again. National kingdoms were established in these areas, and the Habsburgs were not able to restore their influence there for decades. With Ladislaus's death, the Albertine line died out, and the Leopoldian line took over all the family possessions.\n\n===Holy Roman emperors===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Growth of the Habsburg Empire in Central Europe]]\n\nIn 1440, [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] was chosen by the [[Prince-elector|electoral college]] to succeed Albert II as the king. Several Habsburg kings had attempted to gain the imperial throne over the years, but success finally arrived on 19 March 1452, when [[Pope Nicholas V]] crowned Frederick III as the Holy Roman Emperor in a grand ceremony held in Rome. In Frederick III, the Pope found an important political ally with whose help he was able to counter the [[conciliarism|conciliar movement]].<ref name=heimann/>\n\nWhile in Rome, Frederick III married [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Eleanor of Portugal]], enabling him to build a network of connections with dynasties in the west and southeast of Europe. Frederick was rather distant to his family; Eleanor, by contrast, had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children and therefore played an important role in the family's rise to prominence. After Frederick III's coronation, the Habsburgs were able to hold the imperial throne almost continuously for centuries, until 1806.<ref name=heimann/>\n\nAs emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and positioned himself as the judge over the family's internal conflicts, often making use of the ''[[privilegium maius]]''. He was able to restore the unity of the house's Austrian lands, as the Albertinian line was now extinct. Territorial integrity was also strengthened by the extinction of the [[Tyrolean line|Tyrolean branch]] of the Leopoldian line in 1490/1496. Frederick's aim was to make Austria a united country, stretching from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Mur (river)|Mur]] and [[Leitha]].<ref name=heimann/>\n\nOn the external front, one of Frederick's main achievements was the [[Siege of Neuss]] (1474\u201375), in which he forced [[Charles the Bold of Burgundy]] to give his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] as wife to Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]].<ref name=heimann/> The wedding took place on the evening of 16 August 1477 and ultimately resulted in the Habsburgs acquiring control of the [[Low Countries]]. After Mary's early death in 1482, Maximilian attempted to secure the Burgundian heritance to one of his and Mary's children [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. [[Charles VIII of France]] contested this, using both military and dynastic means, but the Burgundian succession was finally ruled in favor of Philip in the [[Treaty of Senlis]] in 1493.<ref name=erbe>Erbe, Michael: Die Habsburger 1493-1918.

Maximilian was initially unable to travel to Rome to receive the Imperial title from the Pope, due to opposition from Venice and from the French who were occupying Milan, as well a refusal from the Pope due to enemy forces being present on his territory. In 1508, Maximilian proclaimed himself as the \"chosen Emperor,\" and this was also recognized by the Pope due to changes in political alliances. This had a historical consequence in that, in the future, the Roman King would also automatically become Emperor, without needing the Pope's consent. In 1530, Emperor Charles V became the last person to be crowned as the Emperor by the Pope.<ref name=\"erbe\"/>\n\n[[File: Habsburg Map 1547.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A map of the dominion of the Habsburgs following the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] (1547) as depicted in ''The Cambridge Modern History Atlas'' (1912); Habsburg lands are shaded green but do not include the lands of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] over which they presided, nor the vast Castilian holdings outside of Europe, particularly in the [[New World]].]]\n\nMaximilian's rule (1493\u20131519) was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs. In 1497, Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] (also known as Phillip the Fair) married [[Joanna of Castile]], also known as Joan the Mad, heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Aragon]], and most of Spain. Phillip and Joan had six children, the eldest of whom became [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Charles V]] and inherited the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (including their colonies in the [[New World]]) as Charles I, Southern Italy, [[Austria]], and the [[Low Countries]].<ref>Great Events from History, ''The Renaissance & Early Modern Era'', Vol I, p. 112\u2013114, author-Clare Callaghan, {{ISBN|1-58765-214-5}}.</ref>\n\nThe foundations for the later empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] were laid in 1515 by the means of a double wedding between Louis, only son of [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary]], and Maximilian's granddaughter Mary; and between her brother Archduke Ferdinand and Vladislaus' daughter Anna. The wedding was celebrated in grand style on 22 July 1515 and has been described by some historians as the [[First Congress of Vienna]] due to its significant implications for Europe's political landscape. All the children were still minors, so the wedding was formally completed in 1521. Vladislaus died on 13 March 1516, and Maximilian died on 12 January 1519, but his designs were ultimately successful: on Louis's death in 1526, Maximilian's grandson and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], became the King of Bohemia.\n\nThe Habsburg dynasty achieved the position of a true [[world power]] by the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s election in 1519, for the first and only time in their history\u2014the \"World Emperor\" ruling an [[The empire on which the sun never sets|\"empire on which the sun never sets\"]].\n\nThe Habsburgs' policies against [[Protestantism]] led to an eradication of the former throughout vast areas under their control.\n\n===Division of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs===\n[[File: Philip II's realms in 1598.png|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Iberian Union]] in 1598, during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], King of Spain and Portugal]]\n[[File: Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Spanish and Austrian Habsburg Dominions in 1700, not showing their overseas empire, but showing the division between the Spanish and Austrian branch with their losses and gains.]]\n\nAfter the abdication of Charles V in 1556, the Habsburg dynasty split into the branch of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] (or German Habsburgs) and the branch of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburgs]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7wodBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR17&dq=1556+Austrian+Habsburgs+Soanish+Habsburgs#v=onepage&q=1556+Austrian+Habsburgs+Soanish+Habsburgs&f=false|title=The Thirty Years War: A Sourcebook|first=Peter H.|last=Wilson|date=October 27, 2010|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|via=Google Books|isbn=9781137069771}}</ref> [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], King of Bohemia, Hungary,<ref>[[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] was partly under Habsburg rule from 1526.

[[Philip II of Spain]], son of Charles V, became King of Spain and its colonial empire, and ruler of the [[Mezzogiorno]] of Italy. The Spanish Habsburgs also ruled Portugal for a time (1580\u20131640).\n\nThe [[Seventeen Provinces]] and the [[Duchy of Milan]] were also left in personal union under the [[King of Spain]], but remained part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Furthermore, the Spanish king had claims on Hungary and Bohemia. In the secret [[O\u00f1ate treaty]], the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs settled their mutual claims. The Spanish Habsburgs died out in 1700 (prompting the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]), as did the last male of the Austrian Habsburg line in 1740 (prompting the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]), and finally the last female of the Habsburg male line in 1780.\n\n=== Inbreeding ===\nThe Habsburgs sought to consolidate their power by the frequent use of [[consanguineous marriage]]s. This resulted in a cumulatively deleterious effect on their [[gene pool]]. [[Cousin marriage|Marriages between the first cousin]]s, or between uncle and niece, were commonplace in the family. A study of 3,000 family members over 16 generations by the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] suggests that inbreeding directly led to their extinction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNumerous members of the family show specific facial deformities: an enlarged lower jaw with an extended chin known as [[mandibular prognathism]] or \"Habsburg jaw\", a large nose with hump and hanging tip (\"Habsburg nose\"), and an everted lower lip (\"Habsburg lip\"). The latter two are signs of [[Maxillary hypoplasia|maxillary deficiency]].  A 2019 study found that the degree of mandibular prognasthism in the Habsburg family shows a statistically significant correlation with the degree of inbreeding. A correlation between maxillary deficiency and degree of inbreeding was also present but was not statistically significant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vilas|first=Rom\u00e1n|last2=Ceballos|first2=Francisco C.|last3=Al-Soufi|first3=Laila|last4=Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda|first4=Ra\u00fal|last5=Moreno|first5=Carlos|last6=Moreno|first6=Manuel|last7=Villanueva|first7=Laura|last8=Ruiz|first8=Luis|last9=Mateos|first9=Jes\u00fas|last10=Gonz\u00e1lez|first10=David|last11=Ruiz|first11=Jennifer|date=2019-12-02|title=Is the \u201cHabsburg jaw\u201d related to inbreeding?|url=https://tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/03014460.2019.1687752|journal=Annals of Human Biology|pages=1\u20139|doi=10.1080/03014460.2019.1687752|issn=0301-4460}}</ref>\n\n===Extinction of the Spanish Habsburgs===\nThe gene pool eventually became so small that the last of the Spanish line, [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], who was severely disabled from birth, perhaps by [[genetic disorders]], possessed a [[genome]] comparable to that of a child born to a brother and sister, as did his father, probably because of \"remote [[inbreeding]]\".<ref name=inbred>{{cite journal|title=The Role of Inbreeding in the Extinction of a European Royal Dynasty|date=April 15, 2009|pmid=19367331|pmc=2664480|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005174|first1=Gonzalo|last1=Alvarez|last2=Ceballos|first2=Francisco C.|last3=Quinteiro|first3=Celsa|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=4|pages=e5174|editor1-last=Bauchet|editor1-first=Marc|bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5174A}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|author1=FC Ceballos |author2=G Alvarez |title=Royal dynasties as human inbreeding laboratories: the Habsburgs|journal=Heredity|date=2013|issue=2|pages=114\u2013121|pmid=23572123|doi=10.1038/hdy.2013.25|volume=111|pmc=3716267}}</ref>\n\n{{Ancestors of Charles II of Spain}}\n\n===Extinction of the Austrian Habsburgs===\nThe Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] and in the female line in 1780 with the death of his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]; it was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the [[House of Lorraine]] in the person of her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].

of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine who survived to adulthood:\n\n[[File:Habsburg-Lorraine Genealogy.PNG|1000px]]\n\n==Monarchs of the House of Habsburg==\nThe Habsburg Empire was never composed of a single unified and unitary state as Bourbon France, Hohenzollern Germany, or Great Britain was.  It was made up of an accretion of territories that owed their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord.  The Habsburgs had mostly married the heiresses of these territories, most famously of Spain and the Netherlands.  They used their coats of arms then as a statement of their right to rule all these territories.  As there were many territories, so their arms were complex and reflected the waxing and waning position of the Habsburgs within European power politics.  It was not until the 19th century (see below [[House of Habsburg#Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire|Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) that the arms began to take on their own life as symbols of a state which may have an existence outside of the Habsburg dynasty.  A complete listing of the arms can be found at the [[:fr:Armorial des Habsbourg|Habsburg Armory]].\n\n===Ancestors===\n* [[Guntram, Count of Habsburg|Guntram the Rich]] (ca. 930\u2013985 / 990) Father of:<ref name=\"burkeI\">[[Hugh Massingberd|Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh]]. \"[[Burke's Peerage|Burke\u2019s]] Royal Families of the World: ''Volume I Europe & Latin America'', 1977, pp. 18, 32. {{ISBN|0-85011-023-8}}</ref>  The chronology of the [[Muri Abbey]], burial place of the early Habsburgs, written in the 11th century, states that ''Guntramnus Dives'' (Guntram the Rich), was the ancestor of the House of Habsburg.

The Habsburg possessions also included the rest of what was then called [[Inner Austria]] (''Inner\u00f6sterreich''), i.e. the [[Duchy of Styria]], and then expanded west to include the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]] in 1335 and the [[German Tyrol|Count of Tirol]] in 1363. Their original scattered possessions in the southern [[Alsace]], south-western Germany and [[Vorarlberg]] were collectively known as [[Further Austria]].\n\nThe senior Habsburg dynasty generally ruled [[Lower Austria]] from Vienna as [[archduke]] (\"paramount duke\") of the [[Duchy of Austria]]. The Styrian lands had already been ruled in [[personal union]] by the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] dukes of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]] since 1192 and were finally seized with the Austrian lands by the Habsburg king [[Rudolph I of Germany]] upon his victory in the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]]. In 1335 Rudolph's grandson Duke [[Albert II, Duke of Austria|Albert II of Austria]] also received the Carinthian duchy with the adjacent [[March of Carniola]] at the hands of Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]] as Imperial fiefs.\n\nThe Habsburg dukes gradually lost their homelands south of the [[Rhine]] and [[Lake Constance]] to the expanding [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]. Unless mentioned explicitly, the dukes of Austria also ruled over Further Austria until 1379, after that year, Further Austria was ruled by the Princely Count of Tyrol. Names in ''italics'' designate dukes who never actually ruled.\n\nWhen Albert's son Duke [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf IV of Austria]] died in 1365, his younger brothers [[Albert III, Duke of Austria|Albert III]] and [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria|Leopold III]] quarrelled about his heritage and in the [[Treaty of Neuberg]] of 1379 finally split the Habsburg territories: The Albertinian line would rule in the Archduchy of Austria proper (then sometimes referred to as \"Lower Austria\" (''Nieder\u00f6sterreich''), but comprising modern [[Lower Austria]] and most of [[Upper Austria]]), while the Leopoldian line ruled in the Styrian, Carinthian and Carniolan territories, subsumed under the denotation of \"Inner Austria\". At that time their share also comprised Tyrol and the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia, called [[Further Austria]]; sometimes both were collectively referred to as \"Upper Austria\" (''Ober\u00f6sterreich'') in that context, also not to be confused with the modern state of that name.\n\nAfter the death of Leopold's eldest son [[William, Duke of Austria|William]] in 1406, the Leopoldinian line was further split among his brothers into the Inner Austrian territory under [[Ernest, Duke of Austria|Ernest the Iron]] and a Tyrolean/Further Austrian line under [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria|Frederick IV]]. In 1457 Ernest's son Duke [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick V]] of Inner Austria also gained the Austrian archduchy after his Albertine cousin [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] had died without issue. 1490 saw the reunification of all Habsburg lines when Archduke [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund]] of Further Austria and Tyrol resigned in favor of Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].

Originally, it was meant to denote the \"ruler\" (thus \"Arch-\") of the [[Duchy of Austria]], usually from [[Vienna]], in an effort to put the Habsburgs on a par with the [[Prince-elector]]s, as Austria had been bypassed as hereditary prince-electors of the empire when the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] assigned that title to the highest-ranking [[Imperial prince]]s.

They were known as \"of\" (in German von) based on the main territory they ruled.  For example, sons, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters of a ruling French King were known as \"of France\" (see [[House of Bourbon#Surnames used|Wikipedia on House of Bourbon]]).  The name \"Capet\" was an invention of the French Revolutionaries.  \"Bourbon\" was in some sense the name of the house as it was differentiated from the previous Valois kings.  Princes and Princesses of the royal house of England were known as \"of England\", or later \"Great Britain\" (see [[House of Windsor]]) or \"of\" the main title associated with their parent (see [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William of Wales]]). In the Middle Ages, princes of England were often known by the town or castle of their birth (see [[John of Gaunt]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], or [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]]). Even when the royal family had the last name (see [[House of Tudor]], [[House of Stuart]] or [[House of Windsor]]), it was not used in their titles.\n\nSimilarly, the Habsburg name was used as one of the subsidiary titles of the rulers above, as in \"Princely Count of Habsburg\" (see above under Habsburg-Lorraine).  The Habsburg arms (see above) were displayed only in the most complete (great arms) of the prince.  The dynasty was known as the \"house of Austria\".  Most of the princes above were known as Archduke XYZ \"of Austria\" and had no need for a surname. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was known in his youth after his birthplace as \"Charles of Ghent\".  When he became king of Spains he was known as \"Charles of Spain\", until he became emperor, when he was known as Charles V (\"Charles Quint\").  In Spain, the dynasty was known as the [[:es: casa de Austria|\" casa de Austria\"]], and illegitimate sons were given the title of \"de Austria\" (see [[John of Austria|Don Juan de Austria]] and [[John of Austria the Younger|Don Juan Jos\u00e9 de Austria]]).  The arms displayed in their simplest form were those of Austria, which the Habsburgs had made their own, at times impaled with the arms of the Duchy of Burgundy (ancient).\n\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!width=25% |[[File:Arms of Maximilian I of Habsburg.svg|center|100px]]\n!width=25% |[[File:Habsburg Lorraine.png|center|100px]]\n!width=25% |[[File:Habsburg Lorraine Tuscany.png|center|100px]]\n!width=25% |[[File:Habsburg Lorraine Trishield.png|center|100px]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |<small>Arms of Austria impaled with Burgundy (ancient).

Used today by most archdukes/archduchesses.</small>\n|}\n\nWhen Maria Theresa married the duke of Lorraine, Francis Stephen (see above), there was a desire to show that the ruling dynasty continued as did all its inherited rights, as the ruling dynasty's right to rule was based on inherited legitimate birthright in each of the constituent territories.  Using the concept of \"Habsburg\" as the traditional Austrian ruler was one of those ways.  When Francis I became Emperor of Austria, there was an even further reinforcement of this by the reappearance of the arms of Habsburg in the tripart personal arms of the house with Austria and Lorraine.  This also reinforced the \"Germanness\" of the Austrian Emperor and his claim to rule in Germany against the Prussian Kings, or at least to be included in \"Germany\".

Princes and members of the house use the Tripartite arms shown above, generally forgoing any imperial pretensions.\n\n==Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire==\nThe arms of dominion began to take on a life of their own in the 19th century as the idea of the state as independent from the Habsburg dynasty took root.  They are the national arms as borne by a sovereign in his capacity as head of state and represent the state as separate from the person of the monarch or his dynasty.  That very idea had been, heretofore, foreign to the concept of the Habsburg state.  The state had been the personal property of the Habsburg dynasty.  Since the states, territories, and nationalities represented were in many cases only united to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord, these full (\"grand\") arms of dominion of Austria-Hungary reflect the complex political infrastructure that was necessarily to accommodate the many different nationalities and groupings within the empire after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]].\n\n[[File: Imperial Coat of Arms of the Empire of Austria.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Shield of the Austrian part of the empire (1867\u20131915).]]\n[[File:Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary with numbers 1867-1915.png|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Enumeration]]\n\nAfter 1867 the eastern part of the empire, also called [[Transleithania]], was mostly under the domination of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  The shield integrated the [[Coat of Arms of Hungary|arms of the kingdom of Hungary]], with two angels and supporters and the crown of St. Stephen, along with the territories that were subject to it:\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (conjoined with Croatia as the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] - formally known as the [[Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia]], although the claim to Dalmatia was mostly [[de jure]]), the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Great Principality of Transylvania]], the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1915\u20131918), [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)| the City of Fiume and its district]] (modern [[Rijeka]]), and in the center, the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe western or Austrian part of the empire, ''[[Cisleithania]]'', continued using the shield of the Empire in 1815 but with the seals of various member territories located around the central shield. Paradoxically, some of these coats of arms belonged to the territories that were part of the Hungarian part of the empire and shield. This shield, the most frequently used until 1915, was known as the middle shield. There was also the small shield, with just the personal arms of the Habsburgs, as used in 1815.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!|I\n!|II\n!|III\n!|IV\n!|V\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Coa Hungary Country History (19th Century).svg|35px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich Galizien & Lodomerien.png|55px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Erzherzogtum \u00d6sterreich unter der Enns.png|55px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Salzburg.png|45px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Steiermark.png|60px]]\n|-\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Hungary]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Archduchy of Austria]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Duchy of Salzburg]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Duchy of Styria]]</small>\n|-\n!|VI\n! colspan=\"2\" |VII\n! colspan=\"2\" |VIII\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Gef\u00fcrstete Grafschaft Tirol.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum K\u00e4rnten.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Krain.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Markgrafschaft M\u00e4hren.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Schlesien.png|60px]]\n|-\n!|<small>[[County of Tyrol|Duchy of Tirol]]</small>\n! colspan=\"2\" |<small>[[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Carniola]]</small> <small>([[Heraldry#Marshalling|''Marshalled'']])</small>\n! colspan=\"2\" |<small>[[Margraviate of Moravia]] and [[Duchy of Silesia]]</small> <small>([[Heraldry#Marshalling|''Marshalled'']])</small>\n|-\n!|IX\n!|X\n!|XI\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Gro\u00dff\u00fcrstentum Siebenb\u00fcrgen.png|45px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:CoA of Kingdom of Illyria.svg|65px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen.png|60px]]\n|-\n!|<small>[[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Great Principality of Transylvania]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Illyria (1816\u201349)|Kingdom of Illyria]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Bohemia]]</small>\n|}\n\n===Version of 1915===\nIn 1915, in the middle of World War I, Austria-Hungary adopted a heraldic composition uniting the shield that was used in the Hungarian part, also known as the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]], with a new version of the medium shield of the Austrian part as depicted above in the section on the mainline of the Emperors of Austria.\n\nBefore 1915, the arms of the different territories of the Austrian part of the Empire (heraldry was added to some areas not shown in the previous version and to the left to the Hungarian part) appeared together in the shield positioned on the double-headed eagle coat of arms of the Austrian Empire as an inescutcheon. The eagle was inside a shield with a goldfield. The latter shield was supported by two griffins and was topped by the Austrian Imperial Crown (previously these items were included only in the large shield). Then, shown in the center of both arms of dominion, as an inescutcheon to the inescutcheon, is the small shield, i.e. personal arms, of the Habsburgs. All this was surrounded by the collar [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].<ref>H. Str\u00f6hl: ''Die neuen \u00f6sterreichischen, ungarischen und gemeinsamen Wappen.

The griffin supporter on the left was added for Austria and an angel on the right as a supporter for Hungary. The center featured the personal arms of the Habsburgs (Habsburg, Austria, and Lorraine). This small shield was topped with a royal crown and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], below which was the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]], below which was the collars of the Orders of [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary|St. Stephen's]] and [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Leopold]]. At the bottom was the motto that read \"AC INDIVISIBILITER INSEPARABILITER\" (\"indivisible and inseparable\"). Other simplified versions did not have the supports depicted, and the simple shields of Austria and Hungary.  These were the arms of the Empire of Austria with an inescutcheon of Austria, and the Arms of Hungary (with chequer of Croatia at the tip).\n\n[[File: Austria-Hungaria transparency.png|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Middle Common Coat of Arms of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1915 showing most of the larger possessions of the Austrian Empire (left shield) and the Kingdom of Hungary (right shield).

influential and distinguished [[dynasty|royal houses]] of Europe. The throne of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs from 1438 until their extinction in the male line in 1740. The house also produced kings of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]]  with their respective colonies, as well as rulers of several principalities in the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] and Italy. From the 16th century, following the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.\n\nThe House takes its name from [[Habsburg Castle]], a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland, in the [[canton of Aargau]], by [[Radbot, Count of Habsburg|Count Radbot]] of [[Klettgau]], who named his fortress Habsburg. His grandson [[Otto II, Count of Habsburg|Otto II]] was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding \"Count of Habsburg\" to his title. The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries. In 1273, Count Radbot's seventh generation descendant [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] became [[List of German monarchs|Roman-German King]].

In the 16th century, the family separated into the [[House of Habsburg#Division of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs|senior Spanish and the junior Austrian branches]], who settled their mutual claims in the [[O\u00f1ate treaty]].\n\nThe House of Habsburg became extinct in the male line in the 18th century. The senior Spanish branch ended upon the death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700 and was replaced by the [[House of Bourbon]]. The remaining Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]]. It was succeeded by the descendants of his eldest daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]'s marriage to [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis III, Duke of Lorraine]]. The successor house styled itself formally as the '''House of Habsburg-Lorraine''' (German: ''Habsburg-Lothringen''); because it was often still referred to as the House of Habsburg, historians use the [[wikt:appellation#English|appellation]] of the Habsburg Monarchy for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the family until 1918. \n\nAfter the First World War, the House of Habsburg was a vehement opponent of [[National Socialism]] and [[Communism]]. [[Hitler]] diametrically opposed the centuries-old Habsburg principles of \"live and let live\" in relation to ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages \u200b\u200band bristled with hatred against the Habsburg family. The Communists and Socialists as well as the [[USSR]] were strictly anti-Habsburg because they feared opposition in their oppressed countries during the [[Cold War]]. The Habsburg family played a leading role in the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]].\n\nThe House of Habsburg still exists today and its members use the name Habsburg, such as the current head of the family [[Karl von Habsburg]].\n\nThe Habsburg Empire had the advantage of size, but multiple disadvantages. There were rivals on four sides, its finances were unstable, the population was fragmented into multiple ethnicities, and its industrial base was thin. Its naval resources were so minimal that it did not attempt to build an overseas empire. It did have the advantage of good diplomats, typified by [[Klemens von Metternich|Prince Metternich]]; they had a grand strategy for survival that kept the empire going despite wars with the Ottomans, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and Bismarck, until the final disaster of the First World War.<ref name=\"Mitchell2018\">{{cite book|author=A.

His grandson [[Radbot, Count of Habsburg]] founded the [[Habsburg Castle]], after which the Habsburgs are named. The origins of the castle's name, located in what is now the Swiss [[canton of Aargau]], are uncertain. There is disagreement on whether the name is derived from the [[High German]] ''Habichtsburg'' (hawk castle), or from the Middle High German word ''hab/hap'' meaning ''ford'', as there is a river with a ford nearby. The first documented use of the name by the dynasty itself has been traced to the year 1108.<ref>\"Habsburger-Gedenkjahr im Aargau\", ''[[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]]'', (page 17) 23 May 2008.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.art-tv.ch/1965-0-habsburger-gedenkjahr.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921142752/http://www.art-tv.ch/1965-0-habsburger-gedenkjahr.html|url-status=dead|title=art-tv.ch|archivedate=September 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.ch/staatsarchiv/de/pub/fokus/habsburger_gedenkjahr.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223234043/http://www.ag.ch/staatsarchiv/de/pub/fokus/habsburger_gedenkjahr.php |title=Kanton Aargau |archivedate=December 23, 2008|language=de}}</ref>\nThe Habsburg Castle was the [[family seat]] in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe Habsburgs expanded their influence through arranged marriages and by gaining political privileges, especially countship rights in [[Z\u00fcrichgau]], [[Aargau]] and [[Thurgau]]. In the 13th century, the house aimed its marriage policy at families in [[Upper Alsace]] and [[Swabia]]. They were also able to gain high positions in the church hierarchy for their members. Territorially, they often profited from the extinction of other noble families such as the [[House of Kyburg]].<ref name=heimann/><ref name=\"Naumann1855\">{{cite book|author=Karl Gottfried Naumann|title=Genealogische geschichte der Europ\u00e4ischen staaten als h\u00fclfsmittel bei Historischen studien und zum Gebrauch h\u00f6herer Lehranstalten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCZAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA11|year=1855|publisher=F.

Due to these impressive preconditions, on 1 October 1273, Rudolph was chosen as the [[King of the Romans]] and received the name [[Rudolph I of Germany]].<ref name=heimann>'' Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. {{ISBN|3-406-44754-6}}.</ref>\n\nIn a crucial step towards the creation of his own power base in the [[Eastern Alps]], Rudolph led a coalition against king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] who had taken advantage of the [[Great Interregnum]] in order to expand southwards, taking over first the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] ([[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Mark an der Sann|Savinja]]), and then the [[House of Spanheim|Spanheim]] inheritance ([[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Carniola|Carniola]]). In 1278, Ottokar was defeated and killed in the [[Battle of Marchfeld]]. The lands he had acquired in the previous decades were reverted to the German crown. In 1282, the Habsburgs gained for themselves the rulership of the duchies of [[Georgenberg Pact|Austria and Styria]], which they then held for over 600 years, until 1918. The southern portions of Ottokar's former realm, Carinthia, Carniola, and Savinja, were granted to Rudolph's allies from the [[House of Gorizia]]. The resulting arrangement, known as the \"Habsburg-Gorizia equilibrium in the Eastern Alps\" lasted for half a decade.<ref>Milko Kos, ''Srednjeve\u0161ka kultur, dru\u017ebena in politi\u010dna zgodovina Slovencev'' (Ljubljana: Slovenska Matica, 1985), 260</ref><ref>France Dolinar & al, ''Slovenski zgodovinski atlas'' (Ljubljana: Nova revija, 2011), 72</ref>\n\nAfter Rudolph's death, the Habsburgs failed to maintain the Roman kingship. In the 1300s, their attempt to gain the Bohemian crown was frustrated first by [[Henry of Bohemia]] and finally by the [[House of Luxembourg]]. However, the weakening of the [[House of Gorizia]] in this succession struggle enabled them to expand southwards: in 1311, they took over the [[Mark an der Sann|Savinja]], and after the death of Henry of Bohemia in 1335, they assumed power in [[March of Carniola|Carniola]] and in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. In 1369, they would succeed [[Margaret Maultasch|his daughter]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], as well. After the death of [[Albert III of Gorizia]] in 1374, they gained their first foothold on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], in central [[Istria]] ([[Pazin|Mitterburg]]), followed by [[Trieste]] in 1382. The original home territories of the Habsburgs, the [[Aargau]] with Habsburg Castle and much of the other original possessions in what is now Switzerland were lost in the 14th century to the expanding [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] after the battles of [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]] (1315) and [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]] (1386). \n\nThrough the forged ''[[privilegium maius]]'' document (1358/59), a special bond was created between the House of Habsburg and Austria. The document, forged at the behest of [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]] (1339\u20131365), also attempted to introduce rules to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands. In the long term, this indeed succeeded, but Rudolph's brothers ignored the rule, leading to [[Treaty of Neuberg|the separation]] of the [[Albertinian Line|Albertian]] and [[Leopoldian line|Leopoldian]] family lines in 1379: the former would maintain Austria proper, while the latter would rule over Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, which became known as [[Inner Austria]], as well as Tyrol and the original Habsburg lands in Swabia, now known as [[Further Austria]].<ref name=heimann/>\n\nBy marrying [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg]], the daughter of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] in 1437, Duke [[Albert II of Germany|Albert V]] (1397\u20131439) of the Albertine line became the ruler of [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]], expanding the family's political horizons. The next year, Albert V was crowned as the King of the Romans as [[Albert II of Germany|Albert II]]. After his early death in war with the Turks in 1439, and after the death of his son [[Ladislaus Postumus]] in 1457, the Habsburgs lost Bohemia and Hungary again. National kingdoms were established in these areas, and the Habsburgs were not able to restore their influence there for decades. With Ladislaus's death, the Albertine line died out, and the Leopoldian line took over all the family possessions.\n\n===Holy Roman emperors===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Growth of the Habsburg Empire in Central Europe]]\n\nIn 1440, [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] was chosen by the [[Prince-elector|electoral college]] to succeed Albert II as the king. Several Habsburg kings had attempted to gain the imperial throne over the years, but success finally arrived on 19 March 1452, when [[Pope Nicholas V]] crowned Frederick III as the Holy Roman Emperor in a grand ceremony held in Rome. In Frederick III, the Pope found an important political ally with whose help he was able to counter the [[conciliarism|conciliar movement]].<ref name=heimann/>\n\nWhile in Rome, Frederick III married [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Eleanor of Portugal]], enabling him to build a network of connections with dynasties in the west and southeast of Europe. Frederick was rather distant to his family; Eleanor, by contrast, had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children and therefore played an important role in the family's rise to prominence. After Frederick III's coronation, the Habsburgs were able to hold the imperial throne almost continuously for centuries, until 1806.<ref name=heimann/>\n\nAs emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and positioned himself as the judge over the family's internal conflicts, often making use of the ''[[privilegium maius]]''. He was able to restore the unity of the house's Austrian lands, as the Albertinian line was now extinct. Territorial integrity was also strengthened by the extinction of the [[Tyrolean line|Tyrolean branch]] of the Leopoldian line in 1490/1496. Frederick's aim was to make Austria a united country, stretching from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Mur (river)|Mur]] and [[Leitha]].<ref name=heimann/>\n\nOn the external front, one of Frederick's main achievements was the [[Siege of Neuss]] (1474\u201375), in which he forced [[Charles the Bold of Burgundy]] to give his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] as wife to Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]].<ref name=heimann/> The wedding took place on the evening of 16 August 1477 and ultimately resulted in the Habsburgs acquiring control of the [[Low Countries]]. After Mary's early death in 1482, Maximilian attempted to secure the Burgundian heritance to one of his and Mary's children [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. [[Charles VIII of France]] contested this, using both military and dynastic means, but the Burgundian succession was finally ruled in favor of Philip in the [[Treaty of Senlis]] in 1493.<ref name=erbe>Erbe, Michael: Die Habsburger 1493-1918.

Maximilian was initially unable to travel to Rome to receive the Imperial title from the Pope, due to opposition from Venice and from the French who were occupying Milan, as well a refusal from the Pope due to enemy forces being present on his territory. In 1508, Maximilian proclaimed himself as the \"chosen Emperor,\" and this was also recognized by the Pope due to changes in political alliances. This had a historical consequence in that, in the future, the Roman King would also automatically become Emperor, without needing the Pope's consent. In 1530, Emperor Charles V became the last person to be crowned as the Emperor by the Pope.<ref name=\"erbe\"/>\n\n[[File: Habsburg Map 1547.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A map of the dominion of the Habsburgs following the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] (1547) as depicted in ''The Cambridge Modern History Atlas'' (1912); Habsburg lands are shaded green but do not include the lands of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] over which they presided, nor the vast Castilian holdings outside of Europe, particularly in the [[New World]].]]\n\nMaximilian's rule (1493\u20131519) was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs. In 1497, Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] (also known as Phillip the Fair) married [[Joanna of Castile]], also known as Joan the Mad, heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Aragon]], and most of Spain. Phillip and Joan had six children, the eldest of whom became [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Charles V]] and inherited the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (including their colonies in the [[New World]]) as Charles I, Southern Italy, [[Austria]], and the [[Low Countries]].<ref>Great Events from History, ''The Renaissance & Early Modern Era'', Vol I, p. 112\u2013114, author-Clare Callaghan, {{ISBN|1-58765-214-5}}.</ref>\n\nThe foundations for the later empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] were laid in 1515 by the means of a double wedding between Louis, only son of [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary]], and Maximilian's granddaughter Mary; and between her brother Archduke Ferdinand and Vladislaus' daughter Anna. The wedding was celebrated in grand style on 22 July 1515 and has been described by some historians as the [[First Congress of Vienna]] due to its significant implications for Europe's political landscape. All the children were still minors, so the wedding was formally completed in 1521. Vladislaus died on 13 March 1516, and Maximilian died on 12 January 1519, but his designs were ultimately successful: on Louis's death in 1526, Maximilian's grandson and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], became the King of Bohemia.\n\nThe Habsburg dynasty achieved the position of a true [[world power]] by the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s election in 1519, for the first and only time in their history\u2014the \"World Emperor\" ruling an [[The empire on which the sun never sets|\"empire on which the sun never sets\"]].\n\nThe Habsburgs' policies against [[Protestantism]] led to an eradication of the former throughout vast areas under their control.\n\n===Division of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs===\n[[File: Philip II's realms in 1598.png|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Iberian Union]] in 1598, during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], King of Spain and Portugal]]\n[[File: Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Spanish and Austrian Habsburg Dominions in 1700, not showing their overseas empire, but showing the division between the Spanish and Austrian branch with their losses and gains.]]\n\nAfter the abdication of Charles V in 1556, the Habsburg dynasty split into the branch of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] (or German Habsburgs) and the branch of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburgs]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7wodBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR17&dq=1556+Austrian+Habsburgs+Soanish+Habsburgs#v=onepage&q=1556+Austrian+Habsburgs+Soanish+Habsburgs&f=false|title=The Thirty Years War: A Sourcebook|first=Peter H.|last=Wilson|date=October 27, 2010|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|via=Google Books|isbn=9781137069771}}</ref> [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], King of Bohemia, Hungary,<ref>[[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] was partly under Habsburg rule from 1526.

[[Philip II of Spain]], son of Charles V, became King of Spain and its colonial empire, and ruler of the [[Mezzogiorno]] of Italy. The Spanish Habsburgs also ruled Portugal for a time (1580\u20131640).\n\nThe [[Seventeen Provinces]] and the [[Duchy of Milan]] were also left in personal union under the [[King of Spain]], but remained part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Furthermore, the Spanish king had claims on Hungary and Bohemia. In the secret [[O\u00f1ate treaty]], the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs settled their mutual claims. The Spanish Habsburgs died out in 1700 (prompting the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]), as did the last male of the Austrian Habsburg line in 1740 (prompting the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]), and finally the last female of the Habsburg male line in 1780.\n\n=== Inbreeding ===\nThe Habsburgs sought to consolidate their power by the frequent use of [[consanguineous marriage]]s. This resulted in a cumulatively deleterious effect on their [[gene pool]]. [[Cousin marriage|Marriages between the first cousin]]s, or between uncle and niece, were commonplace in the family. A study of 3,000 family members over 16 generations by the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] suggests that inbreeding directly led to their extinction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNumerous members of the family show specific facial deformities: an enlarged lower jaw with an extended chin known as [[mandibular prognathism]] or \"Habsburg jaw\", a large nose with hump and hanging tip (\"Habsburg nose\"), and an everted lower lip (\"Habsburg lip\").

The new successor house styled itself formally as [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Habsburg-Lothringen''), although it was often referred to as simply the House of Habsburg.

However, in anticipation of the loss of his title of Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II declared himself hereditary [[Emperor of Austria]] (as Francis I) on 11 August 1804, three months after Napoleon had declared himself Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804.\n\nEmperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis I]] of Austria used the official full list of titles: \"[[Majestic plural|We]], Francis the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria; [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia and Lodomeria]]; Archduke of [[Austria]]; Duke of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Salzburg]], [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Franconia]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], and [[Carniola]]; Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Cracow|Cracow]]; Grand Prince of [[Transylvania]]; Margrave of [[Moravia]]; Duke of [[Sandomierz|Sandomir]], [[Masovia]], [[Lublin]], Upper and Lower [[Silesia]], [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim|Auschwitz]] and [[Zator]], [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Friule]]; Prince of [[Berchtesgaden]] and [[Mergentheim]]; Princely Count of Habsburg, [[Gorizia]], and [[Gradisca d'Isonzo|Gradisca]] and of the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]; and Margrave of Upper and Lower [[Lusatia]] and [[Istria]]\".\n\nThe [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] created a [[real union]], whereby the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was granted co-equality with the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]], that henceforth didn't include the Kingdom of Hungary as a [[crownland]] anymore. The Austrian and the Hungarian lands became independent entities enjoying equal status.<ref>Microsoft Encarta: The height of the dual monarchy</ref> Under this arrangement, the Hungarians referred to their ruler as king and never emperor (see [[Imperial and Royal|k. u. k.]]).  This prevailed until the Habsburgs' deposition from both Austria and Hungary in 1918 following defeat in World War I.\n\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria\u2013Hungary, 1910]]\n\nOn 11 November 1918, with his empire collapsing around him, the last Habsburg ruler, [[Charles I of Austria]] (who also reigned as Charles IV of Hungary) issued a proclamation recognizing Austria's right to determine the future of the state and renouncing any role in state affairs.  Two days later, he issued a separate proclamation for Hungary.  Even though he did not officially [[abdication|abdicate]], this is considered the end of the Habsburg dynasty.  In 1919, the new republican Austrian government subsequently passed a law banishing the Habsburgs from Austrian territory until they renounced all intentions of regaining the throne and accepted the status of private citizens.  Charles made several attempts to regain the throne of Hungary, and in 1921 the Hungarian government passed a law that revoked Charles' rights and dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\nThe Habsburgs did not formally abandon all hope of returning to power until [[Otto von Habsburg]], the eldest son of Charles I, on 31 May 1961 renounced all claims to the throne.\n\nThe dynasty's motto was \"Leave the waging of wars to others!

single unified and unitary state as Bourbon France, Hohenzollern Germany, or Great Britain was.  It was made up of an accretion of territories that owed their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord.  The Habsburgs had mostly married the heiresses of these territories, most famously of Spain and the Netherlands.  They used their coats of arms then as a statement of their right to rule all these territories.  As there were many territories, so their arms were complex and reflected the waxing and waning position of the Habsburgs within European power politics.  It was not until the 19th century (see below [[House of Habsburg#Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire|Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) that the arms began to take on their own life as symbols of a state which may have an existence outside of the Habsburg dynasty.

Between [[Albrecht IV]] and his brother [[Rudolph III, Count of Habsburg|Rudolph III]], the Habsburg properties were split, with Albrecht keeping the [[Aargau]] and the western parts, the eastern parts going to Rudolph III.

They became all but synonymous with the Habsburgs, as the Habsburgs all but abandoned their own arms for these.]]\n\nIn the late [[Middle Ages]], when the Habsburgs expanded their territories in the east, they usually ruled as dukes of the [[Duchy of Austria]] which covered only what is today [[Lower Austria]] (''Nieder\u00f6sterreich'') and the eastern part of [[Upper Austria]] (''Ober\u00f6sterreich''). The Habsburg possessions also included the rest of what was then called [[Inner Austria]] (''Inner\u00f6sterreich''), i.e. the [[Duchy of Styria]], and then expanded west to include the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]] in 1335 and the [[German Tyrol|Count of Tirol]] in 1363. Their original scattered possessions in the southern [[Alsace]], south-western Germany and [[Vorarlberg]] were collectively known as [[Further Austria]].\n\nThe senior Habsburg dynasty generally ruled [[Lower Austria]] from Vienna as [[archduke]] (\"paramount duke\") of the [[Duchy of Austria]]. The Styrian lands had already been ruled in [[personal union]] by the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] dukes of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]] since 1192 and were finally seized with the Austrian lands by the Habsburg king [[Rudolph I of Germany]] upon his victory in the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]]. In 1335 Rudolph's grandson Duke [[Albert II, Duke of Austria|Albert II of Austria]] also received the Carinthian duchy with the adjacent [[March of Carniola]] at the hands of Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]] as Imperial fiefs.\n\nThe Habsburg dukes gradually lost their homelands south of the [[Rhine]] and [[Lake Constance]] to the expanding [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]. Unless mentioned explicitly, the dukes of Austria also ruled over Further Austria until 1379, after that year, Further Austria was ruled by the Princely Count of Tyrol. Names in ''italics'' designate dukes who never actually ruled.\n\nWhen Albert's son Duke [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf IV of Austria]] died in 1365, his younger brothers [[Albert III, Duke of Austria|Albert III]] and [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria|Leopold III]] quarrelled about his heritage and in the [[Treaty of Neuberg]] of 1379 finally split the Habsburg territories: The Albertinian line would rule in the Archduchy of Austria proper (then sometimes referred to as \"Lower Austria\" (''Nieder\u00f6sterreich''), but comprising modern [[Lower Austria]] and most of [[Upper Austria]]), while the Leopoldian line ruled in the Styrian, Carinthian and Carniolan territories, subsumed under the denotation of \"Inner Austria\". At that time their share also comprised Tyrol and the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia, called [[Further Austria]]; sometimes both were collectively referred to as \"Upper Austria\" (''Ober\u00f6sterreich'') in that context, also not to be confused with the modern state of that name.\n\nAfter the death of Leopold's eldest son [[William, Duke of Austria|William]] in 1406, the Leopoldinian line was further split among his brothers into the Inner Austrian territory under [[Ernest, Duke of Austria|Ernest the Iron]] and a Tyrolean/Further Austrian line under [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria|Frederick IV]]. In 1457 Ernest's son Duke [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick V]] of Inner Austria also gained the Austrian archduchy after his Albertine cousin [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] had died without issue. 1490 saw the reunification of all Habsburg lines when Archduke [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund]] of Further Austria and Tyrol resigned in favor of Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. In 1512, the Habsburg territories were incorporated into the Imperial [[Austrian Circle]].\n\n[[File:Carte archiduch\u00e9 Autriche.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map of showing the constituent lands of the [[Archduchy of Austria]]: the [[Duchy of Austria]] comprising [[Upper Austria]] centred around Linz and [[Lower Austria]] centered around Vienna, [[Inner Austria]] comprising duchies of [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] and the lands of the [[Austrian Littoral]] centered on Graz, and [[Further Austria]] comprising mostly the [[Sundgau]] territory with the town of [[Belfort]] in southern Alsace, the adjacent [[Breisgau]] region east of the [[Rhine]], and usually the [[County of Tyrol]].  The part between Further Austria and the duchy of Austria was the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]].]]\n\n''[[Archduke]] of Austria'', was invented in the ''[[Privilegium Maius]]'', a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke [[Rudolf IV of Austria]]. Originally, it was meant to denote the \"ruler\" (thus \"Arch-\") of the [[Duchy of Austria]], usually from [[Vienna]], in an effort to put the Habsburgs on a par with the [[Prince-elector]]s, as Austria had been bypassed as hereditary prince-electors of the empire when the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] assigned that title to the highest-ranking [[Imperial prince]]s. The Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] refused to recognize the title.\n\nThe archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Furstliche Hauser Band XIV | publisher=C.

The title was first granted to Frederick's younger brother, Albert VI of Austria (died 1463), who used it at least from 1458.\n\nIn 1477, Frederick III also granted the title ''archduke'' to his first cousin, [[Sigismund of Austria]], ruler of [[Further Austria]].\nFrederick's son and heir, the future [[Emperor Maximilian I]], started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife [[Mary of Burgundy]] (died 1482), as ''Archduke'' never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the [[Low Countries]] (where Maximilian is still titled \"Duke of Austria\"). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]] (his under-age son) in the Low Countries.\n\n''Archduke'' was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg territory]], i.e., only by males and their consorts, [[appanage]]s being commonly distributed to [[cadet]]s. But these \"junior\" ''archdukes'' did not thereby become independent hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, ''archduke'' and its female form, ''archduchess'', came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g., Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] of France was born ''Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria''.\n\n* ''[[Rudolph II of Austria|Rudolph II]]'', son of [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]], duke of Austria and Styria together with his brother 1282\u20131283, was dispossessed by his brother, who eventually would be murdered by one of Rudolph's sons.\n* [[Albert I of Austria|Albert I]] (''Albrecht I''), son of [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]] and brother of the above, duke from 1282\u20131308; was [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1298\u20131308.

The title appears first in documents of joint Maximilian and [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]] (his under-age son) rule in the Low Countries.

''The Czechs and the Lands of the Bohemian Crown''. Studies of Nationalities. Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, 2004. pg. 29</ref> As a result, it was not an automatically inherited position. Until the rule of Ferdinand I, Habsburgs didn't gain hereditary accession to the throne and were displaced by other dynasties. Hence, the kings of Bohemia and their ruling dates are listed separately. The Habsburgs became hereditary kings of Bohemia in 1627.

They were known as \"of\" (in German von) based on the main territory they ruled.  For example, sons, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters of a ruling French King were known as \"of France\" (see [[House of Bourbon#Surnames used|Wikipedia on House of Bourbon]]).  The name \"Capet\" was an invention of the French Revolutionaries.  \"Bourbon\" was in some sense the name of the house as it was differentiated from the previous Valois kings.  Princes and Princesses of the royal house of England were known as \"of England\", or later \"Great Britain\" (see [[House of Windsor]]) or \"of\" the main title associated with their parent (see [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William of Wales]]). In the Middle Ages, princes of England were often known by the town or castle of their birth (see [[John of Gaunt]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], or [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]]). Even when the royal family had the last name (see [[House of Tudor]], [[House of Stuart]] or [[House of Windsor]]), it was not used in their titles.\n\nSimilarly, the Habsburg name was used as one of the subsidiary titles of the rulers above, as in \"Princely Count of Habsburg\" (see above under Habsburg-Lorraine).  The Habsburg arms (see above) were displayed only in the most complete (great arms) of the prince.  The dynasty was known as the \"house of Austria\".  Most of the princes above were known as Archduke XYZ \"of Austria\" and had no need for a surname. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was known in his youth after his birthplace as \"Charles of Ghent\".  When he became king of Spains he was known as \"Charles of Spain\", until he became emperor, when he was known as Charles V (\"Charles Quint\").  In Spain, the dynasty was known as the [[:es: casa de Austria|\" casa de Austria\"]], and illegitimate sons were given the title of \"de Austria\" (see [[John of Austria|Don Juan de Austria]] and [[John of Austria the Younger|Don Juan Jos\u00e9 de Austria]]).  The arms displayed in their simplest form were those of Austria, which the Habsburgs had made their own, at times impaled with the arms of the Duchy of Burgundy (ancient).\n\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!width=25% |[[File:Arms of Maximilian I of Habsburg.svg|center|100px]]\n!width=25% |[[File:Habsburg Lorraine.png|center|100px]]\n!width=25% |[[File:Habsburg Lorraine Tuscany.png|center|100px]]\n!width=25% |[[File:Habsburg Lorraine Trishield.png|center|100px]]\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |<small>Arms of Austria impaled with Burgundy (ancient).

Using the concept of \"Habsburg\" as the traditional Austrian ruler was one of those ways.  When Francis I became Emperor of Austria, there was an even further reinforcement of this by the reappearance of the arms of Habsburg in the tripart personal arms of the house with Austria and Lorraine.  This also reinforced the \"Germanness\" of the Austrian Emperor and his claim to rule in Germany against the Prussian Kings, or at least to be included in \"Germany\".

Princes and members of the house use the Tripartite arms shown above, generally forgoing any imperial pretensions.\n\n==Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire==\nThe arms of dominion began to take on a life of their own in the 19th century as the idea of the state as independent from the Habsburg dynasty took root.  They are the national arms as borne by a sovereign in his capacity as head of state and represent the state as separate from the person of the monarch or his dynasty.  That very idea had been, heretofore, foreign to the concept of the Habsburg state.  The state had been the personal property of the Habsburg dynasty.  Since the states, territories, and nationalities represented were in many cases only united to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord, these full (\"grand\") arms of dominion of Austria-Hungary reflect the complex political infrastructure that was necessarily to accommodate the many different nationalities and groupings within the empire after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]].\n\n[[File: Imperial Coat of Arms of the Empire of Austria.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Shield of the Austrian part of the empire (1867\u20131915).]]\n[[File:Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary with numbers 1867-1915.png|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Enumeration]]\n\nAfter 1867 the eastern part of the empire, also called [[Transleithania]], was mostly under the domination of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  The shield integrated the [[Coat of Arms of Hungary|arms of the kingdom of Hungary]], with two angels and supporters and the crown of St. Stephen, along with the territories that were subject to it:\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (conjoined with Croatia as the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] - formally known as the [[Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia]], although the claim to Dalmatia was mostly [[de jure]]), the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Great Principality of Transylvania]], the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1915\u20131918), [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)| the City of Fiume and its district]] (modern [[Rijeka]]), and in the center, the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe western or Austrian part of the empire, ''[[Cisleithania]]'', continued using the shield of the Empire in 1815 but with the seals of various member territories located around the central shield. Paradoxically, some of these coats of arms belonged to the territories that were part of the Hungarian part of the empire and shield. This shield, the most frequently used until 1915, was known as the middle shield. There was also the small shield, with just the personal arms of the Habsburgs, as used in 1815.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!|I\n!|II\n!|III\n!|IV\n!|V\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Coa Hungary Country History (19th Century).svg|35px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich Galizien & Lodomerien.png|55px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Erzherzogtum \u00d6sterreich unter der Enns.png|55px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Salzburg.png|45px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Steiermark.png|60px]]\n|-\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Hungary]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Archduchy of Austria]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Duchy of Salzburg]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Duchy of Styria]]</small>\n|-\n!|VI\n! colspan=\"2\" |VII\n! colspan=\"2\" |VIII\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Gef\u00fcrstete Grafschaft Tirol.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum K\u00e4rnten.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Krain.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Markgrafschaft M\u00e4hren.png|60px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Herzogtum Schlesien.png|60px]]\n|-\n!|<small>[[County of Tyrol|Duchy of Tirol]]</small>\n! colspan=\"2\" |<small>[[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Carniola]]</small> <small>([[Heraldry#Marshalling|''Marshalled'']])</small>\n! colspan=\"2\" |<small>[[Margraviate of Moravia]] and [[Duchy of Silesia]]</small> <small>([[Heraldry#Marshalling|''Marshalled'']])</small>\n|-\n!|IX\n!|X\n!|XI\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen Gro\u00dff\u00fcrstentum Siebenb\u00fcrgen.png|45px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:CoA of Kingdom of Illyria.svg|65px]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Wappen K\u00f6nigreich B\u00f6hmen.png|60px]]\n|-\n!|<small>[[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Great Principality of Transylvania]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Illyria (1816\u201349)|Kingdom of Illyria]]</small>\n!|<small>[[Kingdom of Bohemia]]</small>\n|}\n\n===Version of 1915===\nIn 1915, in the middle of World War I, Austria-Hungary adopted a heraldic composition uniting the shield that was used in the Hungarian part, also known as the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]], with a new version of the medium shield of the Austrian part as depicted above in the section on the mainline of the Emperors of Austria.\n\nBefore 1915, the arms of the different territories of the Austrian part of the Empire (heraldry was added to some areas not shown in the previous version and to the left to the Hungarian part) appeared together in the shield positioned on the double-headed eagle coat of arms of the Austrian Empire as an inescutcheon. The eagle was inside a shield with a goldfield. The latter shield was supported by two griffins and was topped by the Austrian Imperial Crown (previously these items were included only in the large shield). Then, shown in the center of both arms of dominion, as an inescutcheon to the inescutcheon, is the small shield, i.e. personal arms, of the Habsburgs. All this was surrounded by the collar [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]<ref>H. Str\u00f6hl: ''Die neuen \u00f6sterreichischen, ungarischen und gemeinsamen Wappen.

The griffin supporter on the left was added for Austria and an angel on the right as a supporter for Hungary. The center featured the personal arms of the Habsburgs (Habsburg, Austria, and Lorraine). This small shield was topped with a royal crown and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], below which was the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]], below which was the collars of the Orders of [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary|St. Stephen's]] and [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Leopold]]. At the bottom was the motto that read \"AC INDIVISIBILITER INSEPARABILITER\" (\"indivisible and inseparable\").

(Douglas previously played a baseball team manager in the 1951 film, ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]''.)<ref name=\"CBR\" />  On Friday, September 11, 1959, the day after the episode finished shooting, Douglas died. Douglas had been, unbeknownst to anyone, suffering from an incipient [[coronary]] during the production<ref name=\"CBR\" />; his performance was adversely affected, as on film, Douglas appeared mottled and out-of-breath.\n\nWriter and executive producer Rod Serling felt that the circumstances of Douglas' death (he was quite literally dying on camera) cast a pall over what was supposed to be a light-hearted comedic episode, and decided that a re-shoot was necessary.  CBS refused to finance any re-shooting, so consequently, virtually the entire production was refilmed at the expense of Rod Serling's Cayuga Productions with [[Jack Warden]] in the team manager's role.<ref name=\"fangraphs\" /> The other roles were not recast, and as much footage from the original filming was used as possible, including (in the episode's final shot) a scene in which Douglas is seen in the distance, with his back to the camera, as the manager. Original director [[Alvin Ganzer]] was not available for the re-shoot, so Robert Parrish was brought to complete shooting; both are credited as directors on the finished episode.\n\nIn Serling's original first-draft script (and in his short-story adaptation that appeared in the 1960 anthology, ''Stories from The Twilight Zone''), the team was supposed to have been the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (their stadium in the original story was \"Tebbet's Field\"), who, like the fictitious \"Hoboken Zephyrs\", moved west in 1958 to become the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. The closing narration refers to the original draft: at the time of broadcast, the Dodgers had beaten the [[Chicago White Sox]] to win [[1959 World Series|the previous year's World Series]], doing so with a dominant pitching staff featuring [[Don Drysdale]], [[Johnny Podres]] and a young [[Sandy Koufax]].\n\nThe baseball scenes were filmed at the Los Angeles version of [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]], an often-used venue for Hollywood films featuring baseball action scenes.<ref name=\"fangraphs\" /> The TV series ''[[Home Run Derby (TV series)|Home Run Derby]]'' was also filmed at Wrigley, and also aired that summer of 1960.<ref name=\"fangraphs\" /> The Wrigley footage, with the stands empty, was supplemented by brief clips of stock-footage crowd scenes, from the [[Polo Grounds]] and [[Fenway Park]].\n\n==Further reading==\n*DeVoe, Bill.

Rumors later surface intimating that McGarry has used the blueprints to build a world-champion team of Casey robots.<ref name=\"fangraphs\" />\n\n==Closing narration==\n{{cquote|Once upon a time, there was a major league baseball team called the Hoboken Zephyrs, who, during the last year of their existence, wound up in last place and shortly thererafter wound up in oblivion. There's a rumor, unsubstantiated, of course, that a manager named McGarry took them to the West Coast and wound up with several pennants and a couple of world championships. This team had a pitching staff that made history. Of course, none of them smiled very much, but it happens to be a fact that they pitched like nothing human. And if you're interested as to where these gentlemen came from, you might check under 'B' for Baseball - in The Twilight Zone.<ref name=\"CBR\" />}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to ''The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic'' by Martin Grams, the entire production was originally filmed with [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]] in the manager role. (Douglas previously played a baseball team manager in the 1951 film, ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]''.)<ref name=\"CBR\" />  On Friday, September 11, 1959, the day after the episode finished shooting, Douglas died. Douglas had been, unbeknownst to anyone, suffering from an incipient [[coronary]] during the production<ref name=\"CBR\" />; his performance was adversely affected, as on film, Douglas appeared mottled and out-of-breath.\n\nWriter and executive producer Rod Serling felt that the circumstances of Douglas' death (he was quite literally dying on camera) cast a pall over what was supposed to be a light-hearted comedic episode, and decided that a re-shoot was necessary.  CBS refused to finance any re-shooting, so consequently, virtually the entire production was refilmed at the expense of Rod Serling's Cayuga Productions with [[Jack Warden]] in the team manager's role.<ref name=\"fangraphs\" /> The other roles were not recast, and as much footage from the original filming was used as possible, including (in the episode's final shot) a scene in which Douglas is seen in the distance, with his back to the camera, as the manager. Original director [[Alvin Ganzer]] was not available for the re-shoot, so Robert Parrish was brought to complete shooting; both are credited as directors on the finished episode.\n\nIn Serling's original first-draft script (and in his short-story adaptation that appeared in the 1960 anthology, ''Stories from The Twilight Zone''), the team was supposed to have been the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (their stadium in the original story was \"Tebbet's Field\"), who, like the fictitious \"Hoboken Zephyrs\", moved west in 1958 to become the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. The closing narration refers to the original draft: at the time of broadcast, the Dodgers had beaten the [[Chicago White Sox]] to win [[1959 World Series|the previous year's World Series]], doing so with a dominant pitching staff featuring [[Don Drysdale]], [[Johnny Podres]] and a young [[Sandy Koufax]].\n\nThe baseball scenes were filmed at the Los Angeles version of [[Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)|Wrigley Field]], an often-used venue for Hollywood films featuring baseball action scenes.<ref name=\"fangraphs\" /> The TV series ''[[Home Run Derby (TV series)|Home Run Derby]]'' was also filmed at Wrigley, and also aired that summer of 1960.<ref name=\"fangraphs\" /> The Wrigley footage, with the stands empty, was supplemented by brief clips of stock-footage crowd scenes, from the [[Polo Grounds]] and [[Fenway Park]].\n\n==Further reading==\n*DeVoe, Bill.

[[Brendan Ford]] played Richard, and Hartley's daughter Justine as Alais.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''Henry II, King of England''' (Male, 50) \u2013 Though aging, Henry is still very nearly as vital as he ever was. His manipulations of family and others are portrayed as spontaneous and emotional as opposed to the well-thought-out stratagems of Eleanor, and the cold, calculating machinations of Geoffrey.\n*'''Queen Eleanor''' (Female, 61) \u2013 Eleanor is the wife of Henry and a beautiful woman of hot temperament, and great authority and presence.  She has been a queen for nearly 46 years and is thoroughly capable of holding her own in a man's world. She schemes against Henry and loves him intensely at the same time.  She has contempt for her children but is not willing to see them harmed.\n*'''John''' (Male, 16) \u2013 He is the youngest son of Henry and Eleanor. He is sulky and sullen, with a boyish outlook on his position; many in the play describe him as a spoiled brat.  He is described in the play as pimply and smelling of compost.  He is Henry's favourite, but also the weakest.  He vacillates throughout the play, not out of cleverness, but out of fear and weakness. He is easily tricked and manipulated by Geoffrey.\n*'''Geoffrey''' (Male, 25) \u2013 He is a son of Henry and Eleanor, and a man of energy and action.  He is attractive, charming and has the strongest intellect of the family; he is also a cold, amoral schemer.  His view of himself is of one who yearned greatly for the love of his parents while receiving none. Yet the play leaves open to question whether any of Henry's three sons should be thought to have been truly loved by either Henry or Eleanor and not merely used by King and Queen as pawns in their ceaseless scheming against one another. \n*'''Richard''' (Male, 26) \u2013 The eldest surviving son of Henry and Eleanor, their second son Henry having recently died. Richard is handsome, graceful and impressive and has been a famous soldier since his middle teens.  War is his profession and he is good at it. He is easily the strongest and toughest of the three sons/princes. Richard and [[Philip II of France|Philip Capet]] have been sexually involved prior to the action of the play. However, Philip declares that he participated in the affair purely for political purposes, whereas Richard indicates he had genuine affection for Philip.<ref>{{cite book | last = Palmer|first= R.

He is not initially as accomplished as Henry in manipulating people, but seems to acquire greater skills at this during the play.
