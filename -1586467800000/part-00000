By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from the exhaled breathing gas, which is then recirculated, and more gas added to replenish the oxygen content. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid-twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: [[open-circuit scuba]] where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and [[rebreather|closed-circuit scuba]] where the [[carbon dioxide]] is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets.<ref name=\"Draegerwerk1899\" /> The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer [[Henry Fleuss]] in 1878, while working for [[Siebe Gorman]] in London.<ref name=davis1955 /> His [[self contained breathing apparatus]] consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50\u201360% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash.<ref name=davis1955/><ref name=\"Quick 1970\" /> During the 1930s and all through [[World War II]], the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first [[Frogman|frogmen]]. In the U.S. Major [[Christian J. Lambertsen]] invented a free-swimming [[oxygen rebreather]]. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA, an acronym for \"self-contained underwater breathing apparatus,\"<ref name=patent /><ref name=\"Brubakk 2003\"/><ref name=\"Vann 2004\" /><ref name=\"Butler 2004\" /> which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment.<ref name=\"oxford\" /> After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute [[oxygen toxicity]].<ref name=\"usn\" />{{rp|1\u201311}}\n\nAlthough a working demand regulator system had been invented in 1864 by [[Auguste Denayrouze]] and [[Beno\u00eet Rouquayrol]],<ref name=\"Denayrouze\" /> the first open-circuit scuba system developed in 1925 by [[Yves Le Prieur]] in France was a manually adjusted free-flow system with a low endurance, which limited the practical usefulness of the system.<ref name=\"Le Prieur\" /> In 1942, during the German occupation of France, [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] and [[\u00c9mile Gagnan]] designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, a twin hose system known as the [[Aqua-Lung]]. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks.<ref name=\"Cousteau 1953\" /> This was patented in 1945. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the [[U.S. Divers]] company,<ref name=Grima /> and in 1948 to Siebe Gorman of England,<ref name=Tadpole /> Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. The patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first [[Porpoise (make of scuba gear)|Porpoise]] Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.<ref name=\"Byron 2014\" />\n\nEarly scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.<ref name=\"Basic Scuba\" /> Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid.<ref name=\"Silent World b\" /> In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s [[adjustable buoyancy life jacket]]s (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the [[neoprene]] [[wetsuit]] and as a [[lifejacket]] that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit an oral inflation valve and a dump valve lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the [[stabilizer jacket]] was introduced by [[ScubaPro]]. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.<ref name=\"Hanauer 1994\" /><ref name=\"Krestovnikov and Halls 2008\" /> A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a \"wing\" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible.<ref name=\"Jablonski 2006\" /><ref name=\"Mount 2008b\" /> Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic [[scuba sets]], each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced [[cave diving]], as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave, as sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. Sidemount diving has grown in popularity within the [[technical diving]] community for general [[decompression diving]],<ref name=\"diverwire\" /> and has become a  popular specialty for recreational diving.<ref name=\"Alert\" /><ref name=\"divernet\" /><ref name=\"x-ray1\" />\n\nIn the 1950s the [[United States Navy]] (USN) documented procedures for military use of what is now called nitrox,<ref name=usn /> and in 1970, [[John Morgan Wells|Morgan Wells]], of (NOAA) began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual.<ref name=\"NOAA 4th Ed\"/><ref name=dan/> In 1985 IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. After initial resistance by some agencies, the use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time.<ref name=\"CMASISA TxManual 2006\" /> Nitrogen narcosis limits the depth when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the [[US Navy]] started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives,<ref name=Kane1998 /> Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 [[Wakulla Springs]] Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community.<ref name=Warwick2015 /> The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles and ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth.<ref name=\"Menduno 2012\" /> In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium.<ref name=\"Mitchell and Doolette 2013\" /> Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets.<ref name=\"Menduno 2012\" />\n\n==Early history==\n\n[[File:Lethbridge diving machine.jpg|thumb|[[John Lethbridge]]'s diving dress, the first enclosed diving suit, built in the 1710s.]]\nA scuba set is characterized by full independence from the surface during use, by providing [[breathing gas]] carried by the diver. Early attempts to reach this autonomy were made in the 18th century by the [[England|Englishman]] [[John Lethbridge]], who invented and successfully built his own underwater diving machine in 1715, but though the air supply was carried in the diving apparatus, it relied on surface tenders to deploy and move around under the water, and was effectively an atmospheric pressure [[diving bell]].\n\nAn early diving dress using a compressed air reservoir was designed and built in 1771 by ''Sieur''<ref>Old French for \"sir\" or \"Mister\"</ref> Fr\u00e9minet from [[Paris]]. He conceived an autonomous breathing machine equipped with a reservoir, dragged behind the diver or mounted on his back.<ref name=scaphandre /><ref name=\"Perrier 2008\" /> Fr\u00e9minet called his invention ''machine hydrostatergatique'' and used it successfully for more than ten years in the harbors of [[Le Havre]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]], as stated in the explanatory text of a 1784 painting.<ref name=\"Silent World\" /><ref name=Freminet />\n\n[[File:Condert diving suit.png|thumb|Diagram of the diving suit invented by Charles Condert of Brooklyn, N.Y. \n<br /> {{unbulleted list |a.

Pipe to supply air into the suit }}]]\nThe Frenchman Paul Lemaire d'Augerville built and used autonomous [[diving equipment]] in 1824,<ref name=\"David 2008\" /> as did the British William H. James in 1825. James' helmet was made of \"thin copper or sole of leather\" with a plate window, and the air was supplied from an iron reservoir.<ref name=\"Davis1955-563\" /> A similar system was used in 1831 by the American Charles Condert, who died in 1832 while testing his invention in the [[East River]] at only {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} deep.<ref name=\"Franklin inst 1835\" /> The oldest known [[oxygen rebreather]] was patented on June 17, 1808 by ''Sieur'' Touboulic from [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[mechanic]] in [[Napoleon]]'s Imperial Navy, but there is no evidence of any prototype having been manufactured. This early rebreather design worked with an oxygen reservoir, the oxygen being delivered progressively by the diver himself and circulating in a closed circuit through a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] soaked in [[limewater]].<ref name=\"plongeesout.com\" /><ref name=\"plongeesout 2\" />\n\nAfter having travelled to England and discovered William James' invention, the French [[physician]] Manuel Th\u00e9odore Guillaumet, from [[Argentan]] ([[Normandy]]), patented in 1838 the oldest known regulator mechanism. Guillaumet's invention was [[Surface-supplied diving|air-supplied from the surface]] and was never [[Mass production|mass-produced]] due to problems with safety. The oldest practical rebreather relates to the 1849 patent from the Frenchman Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard.<ref name=Siccard />\n\n==First successful scuba equipment==\n\nNone of those inventions solved the problem of high pressure when compressed air must be supplied to the diver (as in modern regulators); they were mostly based on a [[Diving regulator#Constant flow|constant-flow]] supply of the air. The compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures to allow useful dive times.\n\nBy the turn of the twentieth century, two basic templates for a scuba had emerged; [[open-circuit scuba]] where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and [[rebreather|closed-circuit scuba]] where the diver's [[carbon dioxide]] is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated.\n\n===Open circuit===\n{{see also|Scuba set}}\n[[File:Dykeri, fig 6, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|left|The Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus was the first regulator to be [[Mass production|mass-produced]] (from 1865 to 1965). In this picture the air reservoir presents its surface-supplied configuration.]]\nThe first systems that became widely popular with recreational divers were open circuit demand scuba. They were safer than early rebreather systems, less expensive to operate, and allowed dives to greater depths.\n\nAn important step for the development of open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the [[demand regulator]], a mechanism that conserves breathing gas supply by providing flow only when the outlet pressure is reduced when the diver inhales. In 1864, the French engineers [[Auguste Denayrouze]] and [[Beno\u00eet Rouquayrol]] designed and patented their \"Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving suit\" after adapting a [[pressure regulator]] and developing it for underwater use. This would be the first diving suit that could automatically supply air to the diver on demand by adjusting the flow of air from the tank to meet the diver's breathing and pressure requirements. The system still had to use surface supply to provide useful endurance, as the pressure cylinder provided was only a low capacity accumulator.<ref name=\"Denayrouze\" />\n\nThe first open-circuit scuba system was devised in 1925 by [[Yves Le Prieur]] in France. Inspired by the simple ambient pressure supply valve apparatus of [[Maurice Fernez]] and the freedom it allowed the diver, he made it independent of surface supply by using three litre Michelin cylinders containing air compressed to {{convert|150|kg/cm2|psi bar}}. The \"Fernez-Le Prieur\" diving apparatus was demonstrated at the swimming pool of Tourelles in Paris in 1926. The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried on the back of the diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur which was adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continuously through the mouthpiece and exhausted through a short tube fitted with a non-return exhaust valve as in the Fernez design. The continuous flow of air and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur's device.<ref name=\"Le Prieur\" />\n\nFernez had previously invented a [[noseclip]], a [[Mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] fitted with a [[Check valve|one-way valve]] for exhalation and diving [[goggles]], and Le Prieur just added a manually-controlled regulator and a compressed air cylinder to those elements. Fernez's goggles did not cover the nose, which allows the diver to equalise the internal pressure by letting air flow into the goggles through the nose, so they did not allow a dive deeper than ten metres due to \"[[mask squeeze]]\". In 1933, Le Prieur replaced the goggles, noseclip and valve) by a [[full face diving mask|full face mask]], directly supplied with constant flow air from the cylinder.<ref name=\"Le Prieur\" /> Le Prieur's design was the first autonomous breathing device used by the first scuba diving clubs in history \u2013 ''Racleurs de fond'' founded by [[Glenn Orr]] in [[California]] in 1933, and ''Club des sous-l'eau'' founded by Le Prieur himself in [[Paris]] in 1935.<ref name=\"Zurcher 2002\" />\n\nIn 1942, during the German occupation of France, [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] and [[\u00c9mile Gagnan]] designed the first reliable and commercially successful open-circuit scuba, known as the [[Aqua-Lung]]. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. [[\u00c9mile Gagnan]], an engineer employed by the [[Air Liquide]] company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator manufactured for use with [[gas generator]]s in response to the constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful endurance of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Le Prieur,<ref name=\"Cousteau 1953\" /> so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.<ref name=\"Scaphandre 2\" />\n\n===Closed circuit===\n{{see|Rebreather|Rebreather diving}}\n\n[[File:Henry Albert Fleuss.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fleuss]] (1851\u20131932) improved the [[rebreather]] technology.]]\nThe alternative concept, developed in roughly the same time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body normally consumes and metabolises only a small fraction of inhaled [[oxygen]]&nbsp;\u2013 the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is [[Boyle's law|compressed]] as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from an oxygen-rich supply so that the oxygen level is not depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> levels would result in respiratory distress and [[hypercapnia]].\n\nThe first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer [[Henry Fleuss]] in 1878, while working for [[Siebe Gorman]] in London.<ref name=davis1955 /> His [[self contained breathing apparatus]] consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50\u201360% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of [[caustic potash]], the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving to a depth of {{convert|5.5|m}} in open water, on which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface.<ref name=davis1955/><ref name=\"Quick 1970\" /> This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by Alexander Lambert, the lead diver on the [[Severn Tunnel]] construction project, who was able to travel {{convert|1000|ft}} in the darkness to close several submerged [[sluice]] doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of [[standard diving dress|standard divers]] due to extremely long distance, along which their air supply hoses became fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.<ref name=davis1955/><ref name=\"Bjorkman\" />\n\nFleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Sir [[Robert Davis (inventor)|Robert Davis]], head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910<ref name=davis1955 /><ref name=\"Quick 1970\" /> with his invention of the [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]], the first rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for [[submarine]] crews, it was soon also used for [[Underwater diving|diving]], being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|industrial breathing set]].<ref name=\"Quick 1970\" />\n\n[[File:New Davis Breathing Apparatus Tested at the Submarine Escape Test Tank at HMS Dolphin Gosport, 14 December 1942 A13873.jpg|thumb|left|[[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]] being tested at the submarine escape test tank at [[HMS Dolphin (shore establishment)|HMS Dolphin, Gosport]], 14 December 1942.]]\nThe rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of [[barium hydroxide]] to absorb exhaled carbon dioxide and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately {{convert|56|l|cuft}} of oxygen at a pressure of {{convert|120|bar|psi}} which was equipped with a control valve and connected to the [[breathing bag]]. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on its front to help keep the wearer afloat. After further development by Davis in 1927 the DSEA was adopted by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=\"Kemp 1990\" />\n\nIn 1911 Dr\u00e4ger of Lubeck tested a self-contained rebreather system for standard diving equipment, which used an injector system to circulate the breathing gas through the breathing loop and scrubber. This was put into service soon thereafter and was available in two versions, an oxygen rebreather DM20 for depths shallower than 20 m, and a nitrox rebreather DM40 for depths up to 40 m.<ref name=\"Draegerwerk1899\" />\n\nDuring the 1930s and all through [[World War II]], the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first [[Frogman|frogmen]]. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Dr\u00e4ger]] submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war.<ref name=\"Diving Heritage\" /> The Italians developed similar rebreathers for the combat swimmers of the [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]], especially the [[Pirelli ARO]].<ref name=Pirelli /> In the U.S. Major [[Christian J. Lambertsen]] invented an underwater free-swimming [[oxygen rebreather]] in 1939, which was accepted by the [[Office of Strategic Services]].<ref name=\"Shapiro\" /> In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA,(an acronym for \"self-contained underwater breathing apparatus\"),<ref name=patent /><ref name=\"Brubakk 2003\"/><ref name=\"Vann 2004\" /><ref name=\"Butler 2004\" /> which later became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment.<ref name=\"oxford\" /> After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute [[oxygen toxicity]].\n\n==Post WWII==\n[[File:Aqualung (PSF).png|thumb|left|[[Mistral (regulator)|Mistral]] twin-hose regulator mounted on a [[diving cylinder]].

The same year Air Liquide created a division called ''[[La Spirotechnique]]'', to develop and sell regulators and other diving equipment. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the [[Aqua-lung|Aqua-Lung]] trademark, which was first licensed to the [[U.S. Divers]] company.(the American division of Air Liquide) and later sold with La Spirotechnique and U.S. Divers to finally become the name of the company, Aqua-Lung/La Spirotechnique, currently located in [[Carros]], near [[Nice]].<ref name=Grima />\n\nIn 1948 the Cousteau-Gagnan patent was also licensed to [[Siebe Gorman]] of England,<ref name=Tadpole /> Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of [[Melbourne]], Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration of this rebreather resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first [[Porpoise (make of scuba gear)|Porpoise]] Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.<ref name=\"Byron 2014\" />\n\nEarly scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.<ref name=\"Basic Scuba\" />\n\nEarly scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid.<ref name=\"Silent World b\" /> In an emergency they had to jettison their weights.

A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the [[stabilizer jacket]] was introduced by [[ScubaPro]]. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.<ref name=\"Hanauer 1994\" /><ref name=\"Krestovnikov and Halls 2008\" />\n\nA backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a \"wing\" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit.<ref name=\"Jablonski 2006\" /><ref name=\"Mount 2008b\" />\n\nIn 1911 [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Draeger]] of Germany tested an injector operated rebreather backpack for a [[standard diving]] suit. This concept was produced and marketed as the DM20 oxygen rebreather system and the DM40 nitrox rebreather system, in which air from one cylinder and oxygen from a second cylinder were mixed during injection through a nozzle which circulated the breathing gas through the scrubber and the rest of the loop. The DM40 was rated for depths up to 40m.<ref name=\"Draegerwerk1899\" /> In the 1950s the [[United States Navy]] (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what we today call nitrox, in the USN Diving Manual,<ref name=usn /> and in 1970, [[John Morgan Wells|Morgan Wells]], who was the first director of the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) Diving Center, began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air.

The term ''[[technical diving]]'' has been credited to [[Michael Menduno]], who was editor of the (now defunct) diving magazine ''aquaCorps Journal''.<ref name=\"Gilliam 1995\" /> The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. In his 1989 book, ''Advanced Wreck Diving'', author and leading technical diver, [[Gary Gentile]], commented that there was no accepted term for divers who dived beyond agency-specified recreational limits for non-professional purposes.<ref name=\"Gentile 1988\" /> Revised editions use the term technical diving, and Gentile published a further book in 1999 entitled ''The Technical Diving Handbook''.<ref name=\"Gentile 1999\" />\n\nThere is some professional disagreement as to what exactly technical diving encompasses.<ref name=Gorman92 /><ref name=Gorman95/><ref name=Hamilton96 /> Nitrox diving and rebreather diving were originally considered technical, but this is no longer universally the case as several certification agencies now offer recreational nitrox and recreational rebreather training and certification.<ref name=\"Rossier 2000\" /><ref name=\"Douglas 2011\" /><ref name=\"GUE 2016\" /><ref name=\"Menduno 2014\" /><ref name=\"PADI Rebreather diver\" /> Even those who agree on the broad definitions of technical diving may disagree on the precise boundaries between technical and recreational diving. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive.<ref name=\"Menduno 2012\" /> The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard [[nitrox]] mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations.<ref name=Richardson/> Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving.<ref name=\"Menduno 2012\" />\n\nNitrogen narcosis limits the depth reachable by underwater divers when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the [[US Navy]] started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives,<ref name=Kane1998 /> followed by salvage diver [[Max Nohl]]'s dive to 127 meters in 1937.<ref name=Nohl1937 /> and the 1939 US Navy salvage of [[USS Sailfish (SS-192)|USS ''Squalus'']].<ref name=dive_hx/> In 1963 saturation dives using trimix were made during [[George F. Bond#Project Genesis|Project Genesis]],<ref name=Bond1964 /> and in 1979 a research team at the Duke University Medical Center Hyperbaric Laboratory started work which identified the use of trimix to prevent High Pressure Nervous Syndrome symptoms.<ref name=CamporesiDAN/> Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 [[Wakulla Springs]] Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community, and by 1994 [[John Chatterton]] and [[Gary Gentile]], dived on the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' expedition to a depth of 100 meters using trimix.<ref name=Warwick2015 />\n\n[[File:Trevor Jackson returns from SS Kyogle.jpg|thumb|left|Rebreather diver returning from a {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on|0}} dive]]\nThe challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles reawakened interest in rebreathers. The ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth.<ref name=\"Menduno 2012\" /> In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium.<ref name=\"Mitchell and Doolette 2013\" /> Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets.<ref name=\"Menduno 2012\" />\n\n[[File:Sidemount 032 Photo by Pete Nawrocky.jpg|thumb|Sidemount diver pushing a cylinder in front]]\nSidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic [[scuba sets]], each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge,  mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced [[cave diving]], as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave, as sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves, and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made [[wreck diving]] penetrations. Sidemount diving is now growing in popularity within the [[technical diving]] community for general [[decompression diving]],<ref name=\"diverwire\" /> and has become a  popular specialty for recreational diving, with several [[diver certification agencies]] offering recreational and technical level sidemount training programs.<ref name=\"Alert\" /><ref name=\"divernet\" /><ref name=\"x-ray1\" />\n\n===Dive computers===\n{{see|Dive computer#History}}\n[[File:Dive computer logbook.jpg|right|thumb|[[Uwatec]] Aladin Pro dive computer showing the log of a previous dive]]\n[[File:Shearwater Perdix and Ratio iX3M GPS in compass mode P9070460.jpg|thumb|Shearwater Perdix and Ratio iX3M GPS dive computers in compass mode]]\n[[File:Submersible pressure transducer for remote display P8160016.jpg|thumb|Submersible wireless pressure transducer for remote dive computer display]]\nScuba decompression planning originally based on printed decompression tables developed for surface supplied air diving. This was inefficient for multi-level dives, and the custom of multilevel diving using tables was not supported by formal experimental testing, but seemed to work reasonably well in practice in accordance with the theoretical models.\n\nThe [[Office of Naval Research]] funded a project with the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] for the theoretical design of a prototype decompression [[analog computer]]. The Foxboro Decomputer, Mark I was manufactured by the Foxboro Company and evaluated by the [[United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit|US Navy Experimental Diving Unit]] in 1957. It was not successful.<ref name=\"Searle 1957\" />\n\nThe first [[recreational diving|recreational]] mechanical [[analog computer|analogue dive computer]], the \"decompression meter\" was designed by the Italians De Sanctis & Alinari in 1959 and built in their factory named SOS, which also made depth gauges. The device functioned so poorly that it was eventually nicknamed \"bendomatic\".<ref name=RRR10177 /> In 1965, Stubbs and Kidd applied their decompression model to a pneumatic analogue decompression computer.<ref name=\"Stubbs and Kidd 1965\" /><ref name=\"Stubbs and Kidd 1965b\" /> Several analogue decompression meters were subsequently made, some with several bladders for illustrating the effect on various body tissues, but they were sidelined with the arrival on the scene of electronic computers.\n\nIn 1983,<ref name=\"Seveke\" /> the [[Hans Hass]]-''DecoBrain'', designed by Divetronic AG a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] start-up, became the first digital electronic diving computer, capable of displaying the information that became the industry basic standard. The DecoBrain was based on A. B\u00fchlmann's 16 compartment (ZHL-12) tissue model<ref name=RRR9434 /> In 1984 development of the US Navy diving computer which was based on a 9 tissue mixed gas model used for the US Navy tables for the MK-15 rebreather was completed by ''Divetronic AG'' by adapting the Deco Brain under an R&D contract.\n\nThe 1984 Orca EDGE was produced.<ref name=RRR9434/> The EDGE displayed the ceiling or the so-called \"safe-ascent-depth\". A drawback was that divers faced by a ceiling did not know how long they would have to decompress, but the display featuring the saturation level of 12 tissue bars permitted experienced users to make a reasonable estimate of their decompression obligation. Orca Industries continued to refine their technology with the release of the Skinny-dipper in 1987 to do calculations for repetitive diving.<ref name=RRR10185 /> They later released the Delphi computer in 1989 that included calculations for diving at altitude as well as profile recording.<ref name=RRR10185/>\n\nEven by the late 1980s, dive computers were not widely accepted. There was a general mistrust of relying on electronics that your life might depend upon underwater, and objections ranging from dive resorts felt that the increased bottom time would upset their schedules, to that some divers felt that the increased bottom time would esult in many more cases of [[decompression sickness]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A workshop held under the auspices of the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] brought together a diverse group that included most of the dive computer designers and manufacturers, some of the best known hyperbaric medicine theorists and practitioners, representatives from the recreational diving agencies, the cave diving community and the scientific diving community.\"<ref name=\"AAUS Dive computer workshop\" /> This workshop produced a set of consensus recommendations for the design and safe use of dive computers that was generally accepted by the scuba diving community, and consequently the opposition to dive computers dissipated, numerous new models were introduced, the technology dramatically improved and dive computers became the standard scuba diving decompression monitoring equipment.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, the US Navy approved the use of Cochran NAVY decompression computer with the VVAL 18 [[Thalmann algorithm]] for Special Warfare operations.<ref name=\"Butler and Southerland 2001\" /><ref name=\"Butler\" />\n\nIn 2008, the [[Underwater Digital Interface]] (UDI) was released to the market. This dive computer, based on the RGBM model, includes an underwater communication system that enables divers to transmit text messages, also featuring SOS and homing capabilities, and digital 3D compass.<ref name=\"utc\" />\n\nTraining agencies have introduced the use of dive computers as part of standard training\nWireless gas pressure displays and consumption rate calculations have been incorporated into some dive computers, which can estimate the remaining bottom time to provide easier gas management. This reduces the risk of out of gas emergencies for single mix no-stop dives. Later developments include multiple wireless transducers which can be set to the specific gas mixture in the associated cylinder, and adjust the decompression algorithm accordingly. Various other [[Dive computer#Additional functionality|software and hardware features]] may be available depending on the model.\n\n===Industry growth===\n{{see also|Scuba diving tourism}}\nThe recreational scuba diving industry diving experienced major growth at the end of the 20th century.

The main factor separating the two applications is occupational health and safety, which applies to professional diving, but generally not to recreational diving.\n\n=== Professional scuba training and certification ===\nProfessional diving is done as a part of the work the diver is employed to do, and as such is generally subject to occupational health and safety regulation. This extends to training, certification and the associated training standards.<ref name=\"Diving at Work Regulations 1997\" /><ref name=\"29 CFR scope\" /><ref name=\"SA Diving Regulations 2009\" />\nCommercial diver training is often regulated by national or state government, so details and standards tend to vary internationally, but there are systems in place for recognition of minimum standards between jurisdictions, allowing some international portability of commercial diver certification. In some jurisdictions a distinction is made between industrial commercial diving and professional diving as part of scientific or public safety occupations, where a variety of regulatory exemptions may apply. In situations where exemptions apply, the training and certification through recreational agencies may be recognised for professional diving activities where this is not permitted for industrial commercial diving.\nMilitary diving is frequently independent of commercial diving regulation, and military diver training is usually controlled by the armed forces which employ the divers.

These are the consensual guidelines for scientific diving programs in the US, and are recognized by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] as the \"Standard\" for scientific diving. These standards are followed by all AAUS Organizational Members allowing for [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] between institutions.

Its purpose and function was \"to insure competent underwater instruction and to reduce diving accidents through education.\"<ref name=\"Icorn\" /> In 1959, its name changed to the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI).<ref name=\"Midwest\" /> In October 1961, NAUI was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit educational organization, with Al Tillman as the President and Neal Hess as the Executive Secretary.<ref name=\"Midwest\" /> In 1966 Ralph Ericson and John Cronin formed the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) in response to a perception that the existing system was not sufficiently responsive to the needs of inland diving instructors. A further split occurred in 1967 with the creation of the National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS) by John Gaffney and a group of diving equipment retailers, followed by a split from NASDS led by Bob Clark to form Scuba Schools International (SSI) in 1970.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nThe Florida Skin Divers Association was formed from a group of local scuba diving clubs in 1952. In 1976 their scuba training committee split from FSDA to form the International Diving Educators Association (IDEA).<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nEarly scuba training included a large component of theory provided by classroom instruction, which could include more than 30 hours of physics, equipment mechanics and other theoretical aspects of diving knowledge. The skills training included fitness, watermanship skills and stress-management training, where staff would put the trainee through in-water situations simulating the most likely emergency situations, so that the divers would be more likely to manage real-life emergencies with composure. Much of this training was, and still is, part of commercial and military diver training. This training required the diver to show competence at both routine procedures and managing reasonably foreseeable emergencies\u2014much the same requirement that persists for certification of professional divers. This approach could be justified by the unsophisticated equipment in use, which could be, and often was, serviced by the diver, and was more prone to malfunctions than later generation equipment. Current standard equipment such as submersible pressure gauges, buoyancy compensators and decompression computers were not available, and the recreational diver was obliged to avoid decompression illness by planning the dive and monitoring the planned dive using a diving watch, simple depth gauge, and decompression tables, sometimes shared with a companion. In the event of an equipment malfunction, the diver was unsupported except by a diving companion. This required a level of competence and discipline that is no longer considered essential for recreational diving by most certification agencies.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nBy the late 1960s equipment was becoming more reliable, and the recreational diver was less likely to experience malfunctions, but the training remained much the same. An increased interest in diving among the general public, and the commercial drive to sell more equipment and training began to change the content and methods of training to a more widely marketable model in the mid 1970s. This included expanding the training to include open-water experience, which was previously not a universal requirement. By the 1970s a second open-water checkout was standard, and more were subsequently added in recognition that training in the actual environment where the skills will be used is important to develop competence. By the 1980s the current minimum requirement for open water diving of four training dives was well established.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" /><!--Note: this applies to US training, and may not follow the pattern of Europe, where BSAC and CMAS were influential. -->\n\nAt the same time, classroom and confined water instruction changed to adapt to the changes on equipment, and to de-emphasise fundamental theory in favour of practical applications more likely to be useful in the expected range of experience for a recreational diver. The general acceptance of the buoyancy compensator, submersible pressure gauge, and alternate air supply in the form of a secondary demand valve as standard equipment changed the preferred emergency procedures for handling out-of-air emergencies, which were simpler to learn as well as reducing the risk. The buoyancy compensator also allowed training to focus on better buoyancy control and alternative methods of establishing appropriate buoyancy. Stress management was de-emphasised, and skills training concentrated on learning the standardised skill set known to be effective most of the time. These changes helped to allow a wider range of potential divers to enter the market.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nThe buddy system had been thought to be a useful corollary to the \"never swim alone\" edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of diving incidents.<ref name=\"Hanna 2006\" /> The buddy system did indeed have some very useful aspects: the cross checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and the enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA continued as a major force in the development of [[diver certification]] during the first 50 years of this new sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as BS-AC, NAUI and PADI, the practice of buddy diving led to one of the two main mantras of recreational scuba: \"never hold your breath\" and \"never dive alone\".<ref name=\"Brennan 1970\" /><ref name=\"Brylske 1994\" />\n\nAn international congress of fifteen diving federations representing all underwater disciplines met in [[Brussels]] on 28 September 1958.

Originally these divers were called \"''Uomini Gamma''\" because they were members of the top secret special unit called \"''Gruppo Gamma''\", which originated from the kind of [[Pirelli]] rubber skin-suit<ref name=\"Rebreathersite\" /> nicknamed ''muta gamma'' used by these divers. Later they were nicknamed \"''Uomini Rana''\", Italian for \"frog men\"<ref name=\"Marcante\" /> This special corps used an early oxygen [[rebreather]] scuba set, the ''Auto Respiratore ad Ossigeno'' (A.R.O), a development of the [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Dr\u00e4ger]] oxygen [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] designed for the mining industry and of the [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]] made by Siebe, Gorman & Co and by Bergomi, designed for escaping from sunken submarines.<ref name=\"Mari\" /><ref name=\"Mari 2\" /><ref name=\"History flyer\" /> The Italian frogmen trained in [[La Spezia]], [[Liguria]], using [[swimfin]]s, rubber [[dry suit]], and the new A.R.O. scuba unit.<ref name=\"Bianchi\" /> After [[Military history of Italy during World War II#Italy enters the war: June 1940|Italy declared war]], the ''[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]'' (''X\u00aa MAS'') attempted several attacks on British naval bases in the Mediterranean between June 1940 and July 1941, but none was successful, because of equipment failure or early detection by British forces. On September 10, 1941, eight ''X\u00aa MAS'' frogmen were inserted by submarine close to the British harbour at [[Gibraltar]], where using [[human torpedo]]es to penetrate the defences, sank three merchant ships with [[limpet mine]]s before escaping through neutral Spain. An even more successful attack, the [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Raid on Alexandria]], was mounted on 19 December on the harbour at [[Alexandria]], again using human torpedoes. The raid resulted in disabling the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} together with a [[destroyer]] and an [[oil tanker]], but all six frogmen were captured.<ref name=\"O'Hara\" />\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] had captured an Italian human torpedo during a failed attack on Malta; they developed a copy called the [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] and formed a unit called the [[British commando frogmen|Experimental Submarine Flotilla]], which later merged with the [[Special Boat Service]]. A number of Chariot operations were attempted, most notably Operation Title in October 1942, an attack on the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']], which had to be abandoned when a storm hit the fishing boat which was towing the Chariots into position.<ref name=\"Tirpitz\" /> The last and most successful British operation resulted in sinking two [[Ocean liner|liner]]s in [[Phuket]] harbour in [[Thailand]] in October 1944.<ref name=\"Hood 2007\" />\n\nAn oxygen rebreather set  called the Lambertsen Amphibious Respirator Unit (LARU) was invented in the United States 1939 by [[Christian Lambertsen]],<ref name=Shapiro2011 /> and was patented in 1940.<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=5PRKAAAAEBAJ Lambertsen's patent in ''Google Patents'']</ref> Lambertsen later renamed it the Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, which, contracted to SCUBA, eventually became the generic term for both open circuit and rebreather autonomous underwater breathing equipment.

These are the United Kingdom, and USA, mainly Florida.\n\n==== UK history ====\nThe number of sites where [[standard diving dress]] could be used is limited and there was little progress before the outbreak of World War II reduced the caving community considerably. The development of underwater warfare made a lot of surplus [[diving equipment|equipment]] available after the war. The [[Cave Diving Group]] re-formed in 1946 and progress was rapid. Typical equipment at this time was a [[frogman]] rubber [[diving suit]] for insulation (water temperature in the UK is typically 4&nbsp;\u00b0C), a closed circuit oxygen [[rebreather]] and an \"Apparatus For Laying Out Line And Underwater Navigation\", developed between 1946 qnd 1949.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The \"AFLOLAUN\" consisted of battery powered lights, [[distance line|line-reel]], [[compass]], depth gauge, notebook (for the survey), and occasionally other equipment.<ref name=\"Farr 2017\" />\n\nProgress was typically by \"bottom walking\", as this was considered less dangerous than swimming in the absence of buoyancy control. The use of oxygen put a depth limit on the dives. This was the normal procedure until approximately 1960 when new techniques using wetsuits and open-circuit scuba sets were introduced. The development of side mounting cylinders, helmet-mounted lights and free-swimming with fins increased accessibility, and the increasing capacity and pressure rating of air cylinders extended dive durations.<ref name=\"Farr 1991\" />\n\n====US history====\nIn the 1970s, cave diving greatly increased in popularity among divers in the United States. However, there were very few experienced cave divers and almost no formal classes to handle the surge in interest. The result was a large number of divers trying to cave dive without any formal training. This resulted in more than 100 fatalities over the course of the decade. The state of Florida came close to banning SCUBA diving around the cave entrances. The cave diving organizations responded to the problem by creating training programs and certifying instructors, in addition to other measures to try to prevent these fatalities. This included posting signs, adding no-lights rules, and other enforcements.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe cave diving pioneer [[Sheck Exley]] explored many underwater cave systems in Florida, and elsewhere in the US and the rest of the world. On 6 February 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the [[National Speleological Society]].<ref name=\"Cave diving section\" />\n\nSince the 1980s, cave diving education has greatly reduced diver fatalities, and it is now uncommon for a certified cave diver to die in an underwater cave. Also in the 1980s, refinements were made to the equipment used for cave diving, most importantly better lights with smaller batteries. In the 1990s, cave diving equipment configurations became more standardized, due mostly to the adaptation and popularization of the backplate and wing based \"Hogarthian Rig\", developed in North Florida, which keeps equipment configurations simple and streamlined.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nDocumentary films made by [[Wesley C. Skiles]] and [[Jill Heinerth]] have contributed to the increasing popularity of cave diving in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Diving on shipwrecks and other sunken structures ===\n{{see|Wreck diving}}\nWreck diving is [[recreational diving]] where the [[shipwreck|wreckage of ships]], aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to [[Sinking ships for wreck diving sites|scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites]]. Diving to [[Aviation archaeology#Underwater surveying and recovery|crashed aircraft]] can also be considered wreck diving.<ref name=CHAA>{{cite web |url=http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |title=Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association Dive Recovery Team |year=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613130546/http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |archivedate=13 June 2015}}</ref> The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom, and the purpose is for the entertainment of the diver.\n\nSome wreck diving involves [[Penetration diving|penetration]] of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe scientific discipline of [[underwater archaeology]] also involves diving on shipwrecks, but in this field, the intention is to collect data or preserve artifacts.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[Marine salvage]] is the recovery of artifacts and material from shipwrecks and other underwater sites, for commercial reasons or because the artifacts or materials are perceived as having monetary or personal value other than scientific or historical.

By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from the exhaled breathing gas, which is then recirculated, and more gas added to replenish the oxygen content. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid-twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: [[open-circuit scuba]] where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and [[rebreather|closed-circuit scuba]] where the [[carbon dioxide]] is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets.<ref name=\"Draegerwerk1899\" /> The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer [[Henry Fleuss]] in 1878, while working for [[Siebe Gorman]] in London.<ref name=davis1955 /> His [[self contained breathing apparatus]] consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50\u201360% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash.<ref name=davis1955/><ref name=\"Quick 1970\" /> During the 1930s and all through [[World War II]], the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first [[Frogman|frogmen]]. In the U.S. Major [[Christian J. Lambertsen]] invented a free-swimming [[oxygen rebreather]]. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA, an acronym for \"self-contained underwater breathing apparatus,\"<ref name=patent /><ref name=\"Brubakk 2003\"/><ref name=\"Vann 2004\" /><ref name=\"Butler 2004\" /> which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment.<ref name=\"oxford\" /> After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers.

James' helmet was made of \"thin copper or sole of leather\" with a plate window, and the air was supplied from an iron reservoir.<ref name=\"Davis1955-563\" /> A similar system was used in 1831 by the American Charles Condert, who died in 1832 while testing his invention in the [[East River]] at only {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} deep.<ref name=\"Franklin inst 1835\" /> The oldest known [[oxygen rebreather]] was patented on June 17, 1808 by ''Sieur'' Touboulic from [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[mechanic]] in [[Napoleon]]'s Imperial Navy, but there is no evidence of any prototype having been manufactured. This early rebreather design worked with an oxygen reservoir, the oxygen being delivered progressively by the diver himself and circulating in a closed circuit through a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] soaked in [[limewater]].<ref name=\"plongeesout.com\" /><ref name=\"plongeesout 2\" />\n\nAfter having travelled to England and discovered William James' invention, the French [[physician]] Manuel Th\u00e9odore Guillaumet, from [[Argentan]] ([[Normandy]]), patented in 1838 the oldest known regulator mechanism. Guillaumet's invention was [[Surface-supplied diving|air-supplied from the surface]] and was never [[Mass production|mass-produced]] due to problems with safety. The oldest practical rebreather relates to the 1849 patent from the Frenchman Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard.<ref name=Siccard />\n\n==First successful scuba equipment==\n\nNone of those inventions solved the problem of high pressure when compressed air must be supplied to the diver (as in modern regulators); they were mostly based on a [[Diving regulator#Constant flow|constant-flow]] supply of the air. The compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures to allow useful dive times.\n\nBy the turn of the twentieth century, two basic templates for a scuba had emerged; [[open-circuit scuba]] where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and [[rebreather|closed-circuit scuba]] where the diver's [[carbon dioxide]] is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated.\n\n===Open circuit===\n{{see also|Scuba set}}\n[[File:Dykeri, fig 6, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|left|The Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus was the first regulator to be [[Mass production|mass-produced]] (from 1865 to 1965). In this picture the air reservoir presents its surface-supplied configuration.]]\nThe first systems that became widely popular with recreational divers were open circuit demand scuba. They were safer than early rebreather systems, less expensive to operate, and allowed dives to greater depths.\n\nAn important step for the development of open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the [[demand regulator]], a mechanism that conserves breathing gas supply by providing flow only when the outlet pressure is reduced when the diver inhales. In 1864, the French engineers [[Auguste Denayrouze]] and [[Beno\u00eet Rouquayrol]] designed and patented their \"Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving suit\" after adapting a [[pressure regulator]] and developing it for underwater use. This would be the first diving suit that could automatically supply air to the diver on demand by adjusting the flow of air from the tank to meet the diver's breathing and pressure requirements. The system still had to use surface supply to provide useful endurance, as the pressure cylinder provided was only a low capacity accumulator.<ref name=\"Denayrouze\" />\n\nThe first open-circuit scuba system was devised in 1925 by [[Yves Le Prieur]] in France. Inspired by the simple ambient pressure supply valve apparatus of [[Maurice Fernez]] and the freedom it allowed the diver, he made it independent of surface supply by using three litre Michelin cylinders containing air compressed to {{convert|150|kg/cm2|psi bar}}. The \"Fernez-Le Prieur\" diving apparatus was demonstrated at the swimming pool of Tourelles in Paris in 1926. The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried on the back of the diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur which was adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continuously through the mouthpiece and exhausted through a short tube fitted with a non-return exhaust valve as in the Fernez design. The continuous flow of air and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur's device.<ref name=\"Le Prieur\" />\n\nFernez had previously invented a [[noseclip]], a [[Mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] fitted with a [[Check valve|one-way valve]] for exhalation and diving [[goggles]], and Le Prieur just added a manually-controlled regulator and a compressed air cylinder to those elements. Fernez's goggles did not cover the nose, which allows the diver to equalise the internal pressure by letting air flow into the goggles through the nose, so they did not allow a dive deeper than ten metres due to \"[[mask squeeze]]\". In 1933, Le Prieur replaced the goggles, noseclip and valve) by a [[full face diving mask|full face mask]], directly supplied with constant flow air from the cylinder.<ref name=\"Le Prieur\" /> Le Prieur's design was the first autonomous breathing device used by the first scuba diving clubs in history \u2013 ''Racleurs de fond'' founded by [[Glenn Orr]] in [[California]] in 1933, and ''Club des sous-l'eau'' founded by Le Prieur himself in [[Paris]] in 1935.<ref name=\"Zurcher 2002\" />\n\nIn 1942, during the German occupation of France, [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] and [[\u00c9mile Gagnan]] designed the first reliable and commercially successful open-circuit scuba, known as the [[Aqua-Lung]]. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. [[\u00c9mile Gagnan]], an engineer employed by the [[Air Liquide]] company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator manufactured for use with [[gas generator]]s in response to the constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful endurance of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Le Prieur,<ref name=\"Cousteau 1953\" /> so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.<ref name=\"Scaphandre 2\" />\n\n===Closed circuit===\n{{see|Rebreather|Rebreather diving}}\n\n[[File:Henry Albert Fleuss.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fleuss]] (1851\u20131932) improved the [[rebreather]] technology.]]\nThe alternative concept, developed in roughly the same time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body normally consumes and metabolises only a small fraction of inhaled [[oxygen]]&nbsp;\u2013 the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is [[Boyle's law|compressed]] as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from an oxygen-rich supply so that the oxygen level is not depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> levels would result in respiratory distress and [[hypercapnia]].\n\nThe first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer [[Henry Fleuss]] in 1878, while working for [[Siebe Gorman]] in London.<ref name=davis1955 /> His [[self contained breathing apparatus]] consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50\u201360% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of [[caustic potash]], the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving to a depth of {{convert|5.5|m}} in open water, on which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface.<ref name=davis1955/><ref name=\"Quick 1970\" /> This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by Alexander Lambert, the lead diver on the [[Severn Tunnel]] construction project, who was able to travel {{convert|1000|ft}} in the darkness to close several submerged [[sluice]] doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of [[standard diving dress|standard divers]] due to extremely long distance, along which their air supply hoses became fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.<ref name=davis1955/><ref name=\"Bjorkman\" />\n\nFleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure.

While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for [[submarine]] crews, it was soon also used for [[Underwater diving|diving]], being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|industrial breathing set]].<ref name=\"Quick 1970\" />\n\n[[File:New Davis Breathing Apparatus Tested at the Submarine Escape Test Tank at HMS Dolphin Gosport, 14 December 1942 A13873.jpg|thumb|left|[[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]] being tested at the submarine escape test tank at [[HMS Dolphin (shore establishment)|HMS Dolphin, Gosport]], 14 December 1942.]]\nThe rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of [[barium hydroxide]] to absorb exhaled carbon dioxide and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately {{convert|56|l|cuft}} of oxygen at a pressure of {{convert|120|bar|psi}} which was equipped with a control valve and connected to the [[breathing bag]]. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on its front to help keep the wearer afloat.

The same year Air Liquide created a division called ''[[La Spirotechnique]]'', to develop and sell regulators and other diving equipment. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the [[Aqua-lung|Aqua-Lung]] trademark, which was first licensed to the [[U.S. Divers]] company.(the American division of Air Liquide) and later sold with La Spirotechnique and U.S. Divers to finally become the name of the company, Aqua-Lung/La Spirotechnique, currently located in [[Carros]], near [[Nice]].<ref name=Grima />\n\nIn 1948 the Cousteau-Gagnan patent was also licensed to [[Siebe Gorman]] of England,<ref name=Tadpole /> Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of [[Melbourne]], Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration of this rebreather resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first [[Porpoise (make of scuba gear)|Porpoise]] Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.<ref name=\"Byron 2014\" />\n\nEarly scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt.

Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible.

It was not successful.<ref name=\"Searle 1957\" />\n\nThe first [[recreational diving|recreational]] mechanical [[analog computer|analogue dive computer]], the \"decompression meter\" was designed by the Italians De Sanctis & Alinari in 1959 and built in their factory named SOS, which also made depth gauges. The device functioned so poorly that it was eventually nicknamed \"bendomatic\".<ref name=RRR10177 /> In 1965, Stubbs and Kidd applied their decompression model to a pneumatic analogue decompression computer.<ref name=\"Stubbs and Kidd 1965\" /><ref name=\"Stubbs and Kidd 1965b\" /> Several analogue decompression meters were subsequently made, some with several bladders for illustrating the effect on various body tissues, but they were sidelined with the arrival on the scene of electronic computers.\n\nIn 1983,<ref name=\"Seveke\" /> the [[Hans Hass]]-''DecoBrain'', designed by Divetronic AG a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] start-up, became the first digital electronic diving computer, capable of displaying the information that became the industry basic standard. The DecoBrain was based on A. B\u00fchlmann's 16 compartment (ZHL-12) tissue model<ref name=RRR9434 /> In 1984 development of the US Navy diving computer which was based on a 9 tissue mixed gas model used for the US Navy tables for the MK-15 rebreather was completed by ''Divetronic AG'' by adapting the Deco Brain under an R&D contract.\n\nThe 1984 Orca EDGE was produced.<ref name=RRR9434/> The EDGE displayed the ceiling or the so-called \"safe-ascent-depth\". A drawback was that divers faced by a ceiling did not know how long they would have to decompress, but the display featuring the saturation level of 12 tissue bars permitted experienced users to make a reasonable estimate of their decompression obligation. Orca Industries continued to refine their technology with the release of the Skinny-dipper in 1987 to do calculations for repetitive diving.<ref name=RRR10185 /> They later released the Delphi computer in 1989 that included calculations for diving at altitude as well as profile recording.<ref name=RRR10185/>\n\nEven by the late 1980s, dive computers were not widely accepted. There was a general mistrust of relying on electronics that your life might depend upon underwater, and objections ranging from dive resorts felt that the increased bottom time would upset their schedules, to that some divers felt that the increased bottom time would esult in many more cases of [[decompression sickness]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A workshop held under the auspices of the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] brought together a diverse group that included most of the dive computer designers and manufacturers, some of the best known hyperbaric medicine theorists and practitioners, representatives from the recreational diving agencies, the cave diving community and the scientific diving community.\"<ref name=\"AAUS Dive computer workshop\" /> This workshop produced a set of consensus recommendations for the design and safe use of dive computers that was generally accepted by the scuba diving community, and consequently the opposition to dive computers dissipated, numerous new models were introduced, the technology dramatically improved and dive computers became the standard scuba diving decompression monitoring equipment.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, the US Navy approved the use of Cochran NAVY decompression computer with the VVAL 18 [[Thalmann algorithm]] for Special Warfare operations.<ref name=\"Butler and Southerland 2001\" /><ref name=\"Butler\" />\n\nIn 2008, the [[Underwater Digital Interface]] (UDI) was released to the market.

This reduces the risk of out of gas emergencies for single mix no-stop dives. Later developments include multiple wireless transducers which can be set to the specific gas mixture in the associated cylinder, and adjust the decompression algorithm accordingly. Various other [[Dive computer#Additional functionality|software and hardware features]] may be available depending on the model.\n\n===Industry growth===\n{{see also|Scuba diving tourism}}\nThe recreational scuba diving industry diving experienced major growth at the end of the 20th century.

The main factor separating the two applications is occupational health and safety, which applies to professional diving, but generally not to recreational diving.\n\n=== Professional scuba training and certification ===\nProfessional diving is done as a part of the work the diver is employed to do, and as such is generally subject to occupational health and safety regulation. This extends to training, certification and the associated training standards.<ref name=\"Diving at Work Regulations 1997\" /><ref name=\"29 CFR scope\" /><ref name=\"SA Diving Regulations 2009\" />\nCommercial diver training is often regulated by national or state government, so details and standards tend to vary internationally, but there are systems in place for recognition of minimum standards between jurisdictions, allowing some international portability of commercial diver certification. In some jurisdictions a distinction is made between industrial commercial diving and professional diving as part of scientific or public safety occupations, where a variety of regulatory exemptions may apply. In situations where exemptions apply, the training and certification through recreational agencies may be recognised for professional diving activities where this is not permitted for industrial commercial diving.\nMilitary diving is frequently independent of commercial diving regulation, and military diver training is usually controlled by the armed forces which employ the divers. In some cases there is recognition of military diver qualifications for work in the civilian industry, in other cases not.<ref name=\"SA Diving Regulations 2009\" /><!-- refs SANOPS 96 and equivalents -->\n\nThe [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] (AAUS) is a group of scientific organizations and individual members who conduct scientific and educational activities underwater.

Its purpose and function was \"to insure competent underwater instruction and to reduce diving accidents through education.\"<ref name=\"Icorn\" /> In 1959, its name changed to the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI).<ref name=\"Midwest\" /> In October 1961, NAUI was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit educational organization, with Al Tillman as the President and Neal Hess as the Executive Secretary.<ref name=\"Midwest\" /> In 1966 Ralph Ericson and John Cronin formed the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) in response to a perception that the existing system was not sufficiently responsive to the needs of inland diving instructors. A further split occurred in 1967 with the creation of the National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS) by John Gaffney and a group of diving equipment retailers, followed by a split from NASDS led by Bob Clark to form Scuba Schools International (SSI) in 1970.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nThe Florida Skin Divers Association was formed from a group of local scuba diving clubs in 1952. In 1976 their scuba training committee split from FSDA to form the International Diving Educators Association (IDEA).<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nEarly scuba training included a large component of theory provided by classroom instruction, which could include more than 30 hours of physics, equipment mechanics and other theoretical aspects of diving knowledge. The skills training included fitness, watermanship skills and stress-management training, where staff would put the trainee through in-water situations simulating the most likely emergency situations, so that the divers would be more likely to manage real-life emergencies with composure. Much of this training was, and still is, part of commercial and military diver training. This training required the diver to show competence at both routine procedures and managing reasonably foreseeable emergencies\u2014much the same requirement that persists for certification of professional divers. This approach could be justified by the unsophisticated equipment in use, which could be, and often was, serviced by the diver, and was more prone to malfunctions than later generation equipment. Current standard equipment such as submersible pressure gauges, buoyancy compensators and decompression computers were not available, and the recreational diver was obliged to avoid decompression illness by planning the dive and monitoring the planned dive using a diving watch, simple depth gauge, and decompression tables, sometimes shared with a companion. In the event of an equipment malfunction, the diver was unsupported except by a diving companion. This required a level of competence and discipline that is no longer considered essential for recreational diving by most certification agencies.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nBy the late 1960s equipment was becoming more reliable, and the recreational diver was less likely to experience malfunctions, but the training remained much the same. An increased interest in diving among the general public, and the commercial drive to sell more equipment and training began to change the content and methods of training to a more widely marketable model in the mid 1970s. This included expanding the training to include open-water experience, which was previously not a universal requirement. By the 1970s a second open-water checkout was standard, and more were subsequently added in recognition that training in the actual environment where the skills will be used is important to develop competence. By the 1980s the current minimum requirement for open water diving of four training dives was well established.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" /><!--Note: this applies to US training, and may not follow the pattern of Europe, where BSAC and CMAS were influential. -->\n\nAt the same time, classroom and confined water instruction changed to adapt to the changes on equipment, and to de-emphasise fundamental theory in favour of practical applications more likely to be useful in the expected range of experience for a recreational diver. The general acceptance of the buoyancy compensator, submersible pressure gauge, and alternate air supply in the form of a secondary demand valve as standard equipment changed the preferred emergency procedures for handling out-of-air emergencies, which were simpler to learn as well as reducing the risk. The buoyancy compensator also allowed training to focus on better buoyancy control and alternative methods of establishing appropriate buoyancy. Stress management was de-emphasised, and skills training concentrated on learning the standardised skill set known to be effective most of the time. These changes helped to allow a wider range of potential divers to enter the market.<ref name=\"Brylske 2012\" />\n\nThe buddy system had been thought to be a useful corollary to the \"never swim alone\" edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of diving incidents.<ref name=\"Hanna 2006\" /> The buddy system did indeed have some very useful aspects: the cross checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and the enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA continued as a major force in the development of [[diver certification]] during the first 50 years of this new sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as BS-AC, NAUI and PADI, the practice of buddy diving led to one of the two main mantras of recreational scuba: \"never hold your breath\" and \"never dive alone\".<ref name=\"Brennan 1970\" /><ref name=\"Brylske 1994\" />\n\nAn international congress of fifteen diving federations representing all underwater disciplines met in [[Brussels]] on 28 September 1958.

Lambertson demonstrated it to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) after being rejected by the U.S. Navy<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\" />  OSS not only bought into the concept, they hired Dr. Lambertsen to lead the program and build-up the dive element of their maritime unit.<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>  The OSS was the predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the maritime element still exists inside their [[Special Activities Division]].<ref name=\"CIA\" />\n\nThe [[Shayetet 13]] commandos of the [[Israeli Navy]] have carried out a number of underwater raids on harbors. They were initially trained by veterans of ''X\u00aa MAS'' and used Italian equipment.<ref name=\"Isseroff\" /> As part of [[Operation Raviv]] in 1969, eight frogmen used two human torpedoes to enter Ras Sadat naval base near [[Suez]], where they destroyed two [[motor torpedo boat]]s with mines.<ref name=\"Gawrych 2000\" />\n\nDuring the 1982 [[Falklands War]], the [[Servicio de Inteligencia Naval (Argentina)|Argentinian Naval Intelligence Service]] planned an attack on British warships at Gibraltar. Code named [[Operation Algeciras]], three frogmen, recruited from a former anti-government insurgent group, were to plant mines on the ships' hulls. The operation was abandoned when the divers were arrested by Spanish police and deported.<ref name=\"Algeciras 2011\" />\n\nIn 1985, the [[Moruroa#French nuclear weapons testing|French nuclear weapons tests]] at [[Moruroa]] in the Pacific Ocean was being contested by environmental protesters led by the [[Greenpeace]] campaign ship, [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']]. The [[Action Division]] of the French [[Directorate-General for External Security]] devised a plan to [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sink the ''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was berthed in harbor at [[Auckland]] in [[New Zealand]]. Two divers from the Division posed as tourists and attached two limpet mines to the ship's hull; the resulting explosion sank the ship and killed a Netherlands citizen on board. Two agents from the team, but not the divers, were arrested by the [[New Zealand Police]] and later convicted of [[manslaughter]]. The French government finally admitted responsibility two months later.<ref name=\"UN 1986\" />\n\nIn 1989, during the [[Operation Just Cause|U.S. invasion of Panama]], a team of four [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]] using [[rebreather]]s conducted a combat swimmer attack on the ''Presidente Porras'', a gunboat and yacht belonging to [[Manuel Noriega]]. The commandos attached explosives to the vessel as it was tied to a pier in the [[Panama Canal]], escaping only after being attacked with grenades.<ref name=\"Hoyt2011\" /> Three years later during [[Operation Restore Hope]], members of SEAL Team One swam to shore in Somalia to measure beach composition, water depth, and shore gradient ahead of a Marine landing.<ref name=\"Mann2014\" />\n\n=== Scientific diving ===\n{{see also|Scientific diving#History}}\n{{empty section|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== Recreational diving ===\n{{empty section|date=August 2018}}\nIn 1957, [[Eduard Admetlla i L\u00e1zaro]] used a modified version of the Aqua-Lung made by [[Nemrod]] and broke the world record by descending to a depth of {{convert|100|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"vanguardia\" />\n\n=== Cave diving ===\n{{see|Cave diving#History}}\nThe exploration of underwater parts of caves was started using surface supplied equipment before scuba became available.\n[[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]], co-inventor of the first commercially successful open circuit [[Scuba set|scuba equipment]], is claimed to have been the world's first open circuit scuba cave diver.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nTwo regions have had particular influence on cave diving techniques and equipment due to their very different cave diving environments. These are the United Kingdom, and USA, mainly Florida.\n\n==== UK history ====\nThe number of sites where [[standard diving dress]] could be used is limited and there was little progress before the outbreak of World War II reduced the caving community considerably. The development of underwater warfare made a lot of surplus [[diving equipment|equipment]] available after the war. The [[Cave Diving Group]] re-formed in 1946 and progress was rapid. Typical equipment at this time was a [[frogman]] rubber [[diving suit]] for insulation (water temperature in the UK is typically 4&nbsp;\u00b0C), a closed circuit oxygen [[rebreather]] and an \"Apparatus For Laying Out Line And Underwater Navigation\", developed between 1946 qnd 1949.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The \"AFLOLAUN\" consisted of battery powered lights, [[distance line|line-reel]], [[compass]], depth gauge, notebook (for the survey), and occasionally other equipment.<ref name=\"Farr 2017\" />\n\nProgress was typically by \"bottom walking\", as this was considered less dangerous than swimming in the absence of buoyancy control. The use of oxygen put a depth limit on the dives. This was the normal procedure until approximately 1960 when new techniques using wetsuits and open-circuit scuba sets were introduced. The development of side mounting cylinders, helmet-mounted lights and free-swimming with fins increased accessibility, and the increasing capacity and pressure rating of air cylinders extended dive durations.<ref name=\"Farr 1991\" />\n\n====US history====\nIn the 1970s, cave diving greatly increased in popularity among divers in the United States. However, there were very few experienced cave divers and almost no formal classes to handle the surge in interest. The result was a large number of divers trying to cave dive without any formal training. This resulted in more than 100 fatalities over the course of the decade. The state of Florida came close to banning SCUBA diving around the cave entrances. The cave diving organizations responded to the problem by creating training programs and certifying instructors, in addition to other measures to try to prevent these fatalities. This included posting signs, adding no-lights rules, and other enforcements.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe cave diving pioneer [[Sheck Exley]] explored many underwater cave systems in Florida, and elsewhere in the US and the rest of the world. On 6 February 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the [[National Speleological Society]].<ref name=\"Cave diving section\" />\n\nSince the 1980s, cave diving education has greatly reduced diver fatalities, and it is now uncommon for a certified cave diver to die in an underwater cave. Also in the 1980s, refinements were made to the equipment used for cave diving, most importantly better lights with smaller batteries. In the 1990s, cave diving equipment configurations became more standardized, due mostly to the adaptation and popularization of the backplate and wing based \"Hogarthian Rig\", developed in North Florida, which keeps equipment configurations simple and streamlined.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nDocumentary films made by [[Wesley C. Skiles]] and [[Jill Heinerth]] have contributed to the increasing popularity of cave diving in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Diving on shipwrecks and other sunken structures ===\n{{see|Wreck diving}}\nWreck diving is [[recreational diving]] where the [[shipwreck|wreckage of ships]], aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to [[Sinking ships for wreck diving sites|scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites]]. Diving to [[Aviation archaeology#Underwater surveying and recovery|crashed aircraft]] can also be considered wreck diving.<ref name=CHAA>{{cite web |url=http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |title=Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association Dive Recovery Team |year=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613130546/http://chaa-recovery.ca/content/view/49/50/ |archivedate=13 June 2015}}</ref> The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom, and the purpose is for the entertainment of the diver.\n\nSome wreck diving involves [[Penetration diving|penetration]] of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe scientific discipline of [[underwater archaeology]] also involves diving on shipwrecks, but in this field, the intention is to collect data or preserve artifacts.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[Marine salvage]] is the recovery of artifacts and material from shipwrecks and other underwater sites, for commercial reasons or because the artifacts or materials are perceived as having monetary or personal value other than scientific or historical.

He was the showrunner for the first season of the Netflix series ''[[Stranger Things]]'' and the co-creator of the TV series ''[[Last Resort (TV series)|Last Resort]]'' with [[Shawn Ryan]]. They were both also executive producers for the series. Gajdusek also wrote for the series ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' and wrote the film ''[[Trespass (2011 film)|Trespass]]'' (2011). He co-wrote the screenplay for the 2013 [[Tom Cruise]] movie, ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'',<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/|title=Oblivion|publisher=|via=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> and ''[[The November Man]]'', which was released in 2014.\n==Early Life==\nKarl Gajdusek was born in 1968 in San Francisco, California, United States. \n\n==Career==\n===Film===\nGajdusek's first professional break came through an option by independent producer Jeff Young for his screenplay ''Widow's Walk''. Although the film would never be produced, Young's attempts to get the film made landed Gajdusek with his first agent. Gajdusek's next film, ''Higher'' was developed with director James Foley and later with director John McNaughton.  For a period of time, Gajdusek teamed with screenwriter Michael Finch. Together they sold a number of pitches to various buyers including two to WWE Films. Their script based on the [[Bill Granger (author)|Bill Granger]]'s ''The November Man'' novel, ''There Are No Spies'', titled ''[[The November Man]]'', first developed in 2009, began shooting in Belgrade in 2013 with [[Pierce Brosnan]] starring in the lead role. The film would finally premiere in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, Gajdusek wrote a solo feature script, ''Pandora'', redefining him as a darker dramatic writer.  After doing uncredited work on [[The Mechanic (2011 film)|''The Mechanic'']] and the Liam Neeson film ''[[Unknown (2011 film)|Unknown]]'', Gajdusek wrote ''[[Trespass]]'' for Irwin Winkler which was released in 2011. Also in 2011, Gajdusek began work on two projects which would shape the direction of his career.  The first was a screenplay based on the Rick Remender and Greg Toocchini graphic novel ''[[The Last Days of American Crime]]''. Gajdusek claims it as one of his favorite pieces of writing.

He co-wrote the screenplay for the 2013 [[Tom Cruise]] movie, ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'',<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/|title=Oblivion|publisher=|via=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> and ''[[The November Man]]'', which was released in 2014.\n==Early Life==\nKarl Gajdusek was born in 1968 in San Francisco, California, United States. \n\n==Career==\n===Film===\nGajdusek's first professional break came through an option by independent producer Jeff Young for his screenplay ''Widow's Walk''. Although the film would never be produced, Young's attempts to get the film made landed Gajdusek with his first agent. Gajdusek's next film, ''Higher'' was developed with director James Foley and later with director John McNaughton.  For a period of time, Gajdusek teamed with screenwriter Michael Finch. Together they sold a number of pitches to various buyers including two to WWE Films. Their script based on the [[Bill Granger (author)|Bill Granger]]'s ''The November Man'' novel, ''There Are No Spies'', titled ''[[The November Man]]'', first developed in 2009, began shooting in Belgrade in 2013 with [[Pierce Brosnan]] starring in the lead role. The film would finally premiere in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, Gajdusek wrote a solo feature script, ''Pandora'', redefining him as a darker dramatic writer.  After doing uncredited work on [[The Mechanic (2011 film)|''The Mechanic'']] and the Liam Neeson film ''[[Unknown (2011 film)|Unknown]]'', Gajdusek wrote ''[[Trespass]]'' for Irwin Winkler which was released in 2011. Also in 2011, Gajdusek began work on two projects which would shape the direction of his career.  The first was a screenplay based on the Rick Remender and Greg Toocchini graphic novel ''[[The Last Days of American Crime]]''. Gajdusek claims it as one of his favorite pieces of writing.

It served in North Africa and Italy in the  [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] and France and Germany in the [[European Theater of Operations|European theater]] between 1942 and 1945.\n\nOriginally the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]] under command of Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], it made landfall at Morocco during [[Operation Torch]] as the [[Western Task Force]], the first all-U.S. force to enter the European war. Following successful defeat of the [[Wehrmacht]] under General [[Erwin Rommel]] in North Africa, the I Armored Corps was redesignated the Seventh Army on 10 July 1943 while at sea en route to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[Sicily]] as the spearhead of Operation Husky.\n\nAfter the conquests of [[Palermo]] and [[Messina]] the Seventh Army prepared for the invasion of France by its Mediterranean coast as the lead element of [[Operation Dragoon]] in August 1944. It then drove a retreating German army north and then west toward the [[Alsace]], being absorbed into the newly created [[Sixth United States Army Group]] in mid-September. In January 1945 it repelled a fierce but brief enemy counter-offensive  during the German [[Operation Nordwind]], then completed its reduction of the region by mid-March.\n\nIn a lead role in [[Operation Undertone]] launched March 15, the Seventh Army fought its way across the [[Rhine]] into Germany, capturing [[Nuremberg]] and then [[Munich]].

This was followed four days later by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]]. By November 8, 1942, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George S. Patton|George S. Patton Jr.]] was commanding the [[Western Task Force]], the only all-American force landing for [[Operation Torch]], codename for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[French North Africa]]. After succeeding there, Patton, now promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]], commanded the Seventh Army, which was formed at midnight on 10 July 1943 by the redesignation of the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]], during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943 in conjunction with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]], Patton's rival. Patton was to command the Seventh Army until early 1944.\n\nThe Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern Sicily on 10 July 1943 and captured the Sicilian capital of [[Palermo]] on 22 July and, along with the British Eighth Army, captured [[Messina]] on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured thousands of enemy soldiers, mainly Italians. During the operation the Seventh and Eighth Armies came under the command of the [[15th Army Group]], under General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]]. The headquarters of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and [[Algiers]] until January 1944, when Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], then commanding the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]], was assigned as commander and the Seventh Army began planning for the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]].\n\nThe invasion was originally given the code name of \"Operation Anvil\", but was changed to \"[[Operation Dragoon]]\" before the landing. In March 1944, Major General [[Alexander Patch]], a highly experienced and competent commander, was assigned to command the Seventh Army, which moved to [[Naples]], [[Italy]], the following July. On 15 August 1944, elements of the Seventh Army assaulted the beaches of [[southern France]] in the [[St. Tropez]] and [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|St. Raphael]] area. (Patch was promoted to Lieutenant General three days later.)  On September 15, the Seventh was put under the field control of the [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]], under Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]]. The 6th Army Group also included the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]]. Within one month, the Seventh Army, which by then employed three American [[Division (military)|divisions]], five French divisions and the [[1st Airborne Task Force (Allied)|1st Airborne Task Force]], had advanced 400 miles and joined with the Allied forces [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|coming south from Normandy]]. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated [[Marseilles]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulon]] and all of Southern France.\n\nThe Seventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the [[Vosges Mountains]] and broke into the [[Alsatian Plain]]. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in late December, it extended its flanks to take over much of the area that had been the responsibility of [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]], then commanded by Patton who had previously commanded the Seventh, which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded American forces [[siege of Bastogne|besieged at Bastogne]]. In mid-January 1945, the Seventh engaged in pitched battle seeking to regain ground lost to Germany's [[Operation Nordwind]] New Year's offensive. Along with the French First Army, the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the [[Colmar Pocket]]. After capturing the city of [[Strasbourg]], the Seventh went into the [[Saarland|Saar]], assaulted the [[Siegfried Line]], and reached the [[Rhine|River Rhine]] during the first week of March, 1945.\n\nIn a lead role in [[Operation Undertone]], the Seventh Army fought its way across the Rhine into Germany, captured [[Nuremberg]] and then [[Munich]]. Finally it crossed the [[Brenner Pass]] and made contact with Lieutenant General [[Lucian Truscott]]'s U.S. Fifth Army at [[Vipiteno]]<ref name=Alps/> \u2013 once again on Italian soil.\n\nIn less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh Army had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 U.S. and Allied divisions, including the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd]], [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th]], [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd]], [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th]], [[63rd Infantry Division (United States)|63rd]], [[70th Infantry Division (United States)|70th]], [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|100th]], and [[103rd Infantry Division (United States)|103rd Infantry Divisions]].\n\n===Cold War===\n{{ external media | align = center |audio1 = You may listen members of the [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]] broadcasting on the radio in Europe from 1956\u20132006 [https://www.7aso.org/htmldocs/asaudiop.html  '''here on 7aso.org''']}}\nThe Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at [[Atlanta, Georgia]], then inactivated again.

Following French disagreements with certain [[NATO]] policies, [[United States European Command]] relocated from Paris to the following year.

(Patch was promoted to Lieutenant General three days later.)  On September 15, the Seventh was put under the field control of the [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]], under Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]]. The 6th Army Group also included the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]]. Within one month, the Seventh Army, which by then employed three American [[Division (military)|divisions]], five French divisions and the [[1st Airborne Task Force (Allied)|1st Airborne Task Force]], had advanced 400 miles and joined with the Allied forces [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|coming south from Normandy]]. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated [[Marseilles]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulon]] and all of Southern France.\n\nThe Seventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the [[Vosges Mountains]] and broke into the [[Alsatian Plain]]. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in late December, it extended its flanks to take over much of the area that had been the responsibility of [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]], then commanded by Patton who had previously commanded the Seventh, which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded American forces [[siege of Bastogne|besieged at Bastogne]]. In mid-January 1945, the Seventh engaged in pitched battle seeking to regain ground lost to Germany's [[Operation Nordwind]] New Year's offensive. Along with the French First Army, the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the [[Colmar Pocket]]. After capturing the city of [[Strasbourg]], the Seventh went into the [[Saarland|Saar]], assaulted the [[Siegfried Line]], and reached the [[Rhine|River Rhine]] during the first week of March, 1945.\n\nIn a lead role in [[Operation Undertone]], the Seventh Army fought its way across the Rhine into Germany, captured [[Nuremberg]] and then [[Munich]]. Finally it crossed the [[Brenner Pass]] and made contact with Lieutenant General [[Lucian Truscott]]'s U.S. Fifth Army at [[Vipiteno]]<ref name=Alps/> \u2013 once again on Italian soil.\n\nIn less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh Army had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 U.S. and Allied divisions, including the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd]], [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th]], [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd]], [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th]], [[63rd Infantry Division (United States)|63rd]], [[70th Infantry Division (United States)|70th]], [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|100th]], and [[103rd Infantry Division (United States)|103rd Infantry Divisions]].\n\n===Cold War===\n{{ external media | align = center |audio1 = You may listen members of the [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]] broadcasting on the radio in Europe from 1956\u20132006 [https://www.7aso.org/htmldocs/asaudiop.html  '''here on 7aso.org''']}}\nThe Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at [[Atlanta, Georgia]], then inactivated again.

Following French disagreements with certain [[NATO]] policies, [[United States European Command]] relocated from Paris to the following year. From that time forward the Seventh Army has been the headquarters for all Army units under the [[European Command]].  Its major subordinate elements were the [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] (Inactivated in 2013 and 1992, respectively.)\n\nIn 1959, [[Grafenwoehr Training Area|Grafenwoehr]] became headquarters of the Seventh Army Training Center, incorporating the Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels Training Areas. In 1975, Grafenwoehr became the headquarters for the Seventh U.S. Army Training Center, which became the [[7th Army Training Command|Seventh Army Training Command]] the following year.  As of January 2006, the 7th ATC became known as the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command.

''Kangaroo Jack'' was theatrically released on January 17, 2003.\n\nThe film was panned by critics, who criticized the acting, directing and writing, especially for a family film, and false advertising. It received a rating of 8% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and grossed $88.1 million on a $60 million budget. ''Kangaroo Jack'' was released on DVD and VHS on June 24, 2003, by [[Warner Home Video]]. An animated sequel titled ''[[Kangaroo Jack: G'Day U.S.A.!]]'' was produced and released on video in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1982 [[Brooklyn]], a boy named Charlie Carbone is about to become the stepson of a [[Gangster|mobster]] named Salvatore Maggio. The mobster's juvenile delinquent apprentice, Frankie Lombardo, tries to drown Charlie, but a boy named Louis Booker saves him and they become best friends.\n\nTwenty years later, in 2002, Charlie now runs his own beauty salon and Louis still remains his best friend, but Sal's henchmen take a majority of the salon's profits, leaving Charlie very little for improvements. After they botch the job of hiding some stolen television sets, resulting in the discovery of Sal's warehouse and the arrest of at least one of his men, Sal gives Charlie and Louis one more chance. Under instructions from Frankie, they are to deliver a package to a man named \"Mr. Smith\" in [[Coober Pedy]], [[Australia]]. Frankie also warns them against opening the package \"under any circumstances\" and that should they run into any trouble, to call Mr. Smith at the phone number he gives them. Unknown to Charlie and Louis, however, Sal tells his Capo that he is \"canceling their return trip.\"\n\nOn the plane, Louis opens the package, against Frankie's warnings, to find $50,000 in cash. Upon landing in Australia, they rent a [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J40)|Land Cruiser]] and head to Mr. Smith. Along their way, they accidentally run over a [[red kangaroo]]. Thinking it is dead, Louis puts his \"lucky jacket\" on the kangaroo and with Charlie's sunglasses to pose for photographs as a joke, as he thinks the kangaroo looks like \"Jackie Legs\", one of Sal's henchmen from [[Canarsie, Brooklyn|Canarsie]]. The kangaroo then suddenly regains consciousness and hops away with one problem; the $50,000 was in the jacket. Charlie and Louis get into their car and try to reclaim the money from the jacket on the kangaroo, but the ensuing chase ends with the duo crashing through a field of termite mounds and then into a pile of rocks, wrecking the car.\n\nAt a pub in [[Alice Springs]], Louis manages to call Mr. Smith and tries to explain their situation. Mr. Smith, however, thinks they stole his package and threatens to kill Louis and Charlie, telling him that they had better have the money ready when he meets them, or he'll \"chop them into snags and feed them to the [[Saltwater crocodile|crocodiles]]\"; he then plans to find them himself. Back in New York City, Sal gets the call from Mr. Smith saying that Charlie and Louis haven't arrived; Sal then sends Frankie and some men to Australia to investigate.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie and Louis attempt to reclaim the money from the kangaroo by shooting it with a tranquilizer dart from a biplane. The attempt fails when Louis accidentally shoots Blue the pilot and strands the duo in the desert. They spend many hours wandering in the desert, during which Charlie [[hallucination|hallucinates]] about a jeep, and they soon meet a woman from the Outback Wildlife Foundation called Jessie, who Louis previously met in Alice Springs. Thinking she is only a mirage, Charlie [[sexual harassment|sexually harasses]] her and she knocks him out with her [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]]. While unconscious, Charlie dreams about meeting a speaking, rapping version of the kangaroo, while Sal and Louis mock him in kangaroo forms. The following day, the trio then track the kangaroo at the nearby [[Todd River|Todd valley]] and try again to catch it with [[bolas]], but Louis accidentally botches their attempt when a swarm of ants crawls up his pants. While waiting for the next opportunity to catch the kangaroo, Charlie begins developing feelings for Jessie, which she claims not to return at first, but he senses that she is lying.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Smith and his henchmen arrive and capture the trio. Charlie and Louis turn the tables and outsmart them, only to find Frankie has tracked them and is prepared to kill them. Just as he is about to, however, the kangaroo suddenly returns, causing a [[Boxing|fist fight]] between the two villainous factions. The distraction allows Charlie, Louis, and Jessie to escape on their camels. A final three-way chase ensues, with Charlie, Louis and Jessie chasing after the kangaroo while being pursued by Frankie and his goons. Louis finally manages to retrieve the money from the kangaroo but ends up nearly falling down a cliff and is narrowly saved by Charlie and Jessie. After getting the money back, they learn from Frankie that Sal really sent them to Australia to pay for their own execution at the hands of Mr. Smith. Out of nowhere, the police force led by an undercover cop Mr./Sgt. Jimmy Inkamale arrive and arrest Frankie, Mr. Smith, and their respective henchmen. Charlie and Louis call each other true friends, and Charlie reclaims Louis' lucky jacket from the kangaroo, who hops away with his family.\n\nOne year later, Charlie and Jessie are married and have used Sal's $50,000 to start a line of new hair care products bearing a kangaroo logo, and Louis has become Charlie's advertising partner. Frankie, Mr. Smith, and their men have been imprisoned for life as will Sal, having failed at using his high-level connections to avoid arrest and a trial. The kangaroo, now called \"Kangaroo Jack\", is still happily living in the [[outback]]. Now able to speak again, Jack explains why the film should end with him and closes it with his version of [[Porky Pig]]'s famous catchphrase: ''\"That's all, blokes!\"''\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Charlie Carbone\n** Robert Reid as young Charlie Carbone\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Louis Booker\n** Shawn Smith as young Louis Booker\n* [[Estella Warren]] as Jessie\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Frankie Lombardo\n** Brian Casey as young Frankie Lombardo\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Salvatore \"Sal\" Maggio\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Anna Carbone, Charlie's mother\n* [[Adam Garcia]] as Kangaroo \"Jackie Legs\" Jack (voice, uncredited)\n** [[Frank Welker]] as Jack's Vocal Effects (uncredited)\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as Mr. Smith\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Blue\n* [[Tony Nikolakopoulos]] as Sal's Capo\n* [[David Ngoombujarra]] as Sr. Sgt.

''Kangaroo Jack'' was theatrically released on January 17, 2003.\n\nThe film was panned by critics, who criticized the acting, directing and writing, especially for a family film, and false advertising. It received a rating of 8% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and grossed $88.1 million on a $60 million budget. ''Kangaroo Jack'' was released on DVD and VHS on June 24, 2003, by [[Warner Home Video]]. An animated sequel titled ''[[Kangaroo Jack: G'Day U.S.A.!]]'' was produced and released on video in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1982 [[Brooklyn]], a boy named Charlie Carbone is about to become the stepson of a [[Gangster|mobster]] named Salvatore Maggio. The mobster's juvenile delinquent apprentice, Frankie Lombardo, tries to drown Charlie, but a boy named Louis Booker saves him and they become best friends.\n\nTwenty years later, in 2002, Charlie now runs his own beauty salon and Louis still remains his best friend, but Sal's henchmen take a majority of the salon's profits, leaving Charlie very little for improvements. After they botch the job of hiding some stolen television sets, resulting in the discovery of Sal's warehouse and the arrest of at least one of his men, Sal gives Charlie and Louis one more chance. Under instructions from Frankie, they are to deliver a package to a man named \"Mr. Smith\" in [[Coober Pedy]], [[Australia]]. Frankie also warns them against opening the package \"under any circumstances\" and that should they run into any trouble, to call Mr. Smith at the phone number he gives them. Unknown to Charlie and Louis, however, Sal tells his Capo that he is \"canceling their return trip.\"\n\nOn the plane, Louis opens the package, against Frankie's warnings, to find $50,000 in cash. Upon landing in Australia, they rent a [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J40)|Land Cruiser]] and head to Mr. Smith. Along their way, they accidentally run over a [[red kangaroo]]. Thinking it is dead, Louis puts his \"lucky jacket\" on the kangaroo and with Charlie's sunglasses to pose for photographs as a joke, as he thinks the kangaroo looks like \"Jackie Legs\", one of Sal's henchmen from [[Canarsie, Brooklyn|Canarsie]]. The kangaroo then suddenly regains consciousness and hops away with one problem; the $50,000 was in the jacket. Charlie and Louis get into their car and try to reclaim the money from the jacket on the kangaroo, but the ensuing chase ends with the duo crashing through a field of termite mounds and then into a pile of rocks, wrecking the car.\n\nAt a pub in [[Alice Springs]], Louis manages to call Mr. Smith and tries to explain their situation. Mr. Smith, however, thinks they stole his package and threatens to kill Louis and Charlie, telling him that they had better have the money ready when he meets them, or he'll \"chop them into snags and feed them to the [[Saltwater crocodile|crocodiles]]\"; he then plans to find them himself. Back in New York City, Sal gets the call from Mr. Smith saying that Charlie and Louis haven't arrived; Sal then sends Frankie and some men to Australia to investigate.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie and Louis attempt to reclaim the money from the kangaroo by shooting it with a tranquilizer dart from a biplane. The attempt fails when Louis accidentally shoots Blue the pilot and strands the duo in the desert. They spend many hours wandering in the desert, during which Charlie [[hallucination|hallucinates]] about a jeep, and they soon meet a woman from the Outback Wildlife Foundation called Jessie, who Louis previously met in Alice Springs. Thinking she is only a mirage, Charlie [[sexual harassment|sexually harasses]] her and she knocks him out with her [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]]. While unconscious, Charlie dreams about meeting a speaking, rapping version of the kangaroo, while Sal and Louis mock him in kangaroo forms. The following day, the trio then track the kangaroo at the nearby [[Todd River|Todd valley]] and try again to catch it with [[bolas]], but Louis accidentally botches their attempt when a swarm of ants crawls up his pants. While waiting for the next opportunity to catch the kangaroo, Charlie begins developing feelings for Jessie, which she claims not to return at first, but he senses that she is lying.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Smith and his henchmen arrive and capture the trio. Charlie and Louis turn the tables and outsmart them, only to find Frankie has tracked them and is prepared to kill them. Just as he is about to, however, the kangaroo suddenly returns, causing a [[Boxing|fist fight]] between the two villainous factions. The distraction allows Charlie, Louis, and Jessie to escape on their camels. A final three-way chase ensues, with Charlie, Louis and Jessie chasing after the kangaroo while being pursued by Frankie and his goons. Louis finally manages to retrieve the money from the kangaroo but ends up nearly falling down a cliff and is narrowly saved by Charlie and Jessie. After getting the money back, they learn from Frankie that Sal really sent them to Australia to pay for their own execution at the hands of Mr. Smith. Out of nowhere, the police force led by an undercover cop Mr./Sgt. Jimmy Inkamale arrive and arrest Frankie, Mr. Smith, and their respective henchmen. Charlie and Louis call each other true friends, and Charlie reclaims Louis' lucky jacket from the kangaroo, who hops away with his family.\n\nOne year later, Charlie and Jessie are married and have used Sal's $50,000 to start a line of new hair care products bearing a kangaroo logo, and Louis has become Charlie's advertising partner. Frankie, Mr. Smith, and their men have been imprisoned for life as will Sal, having failed at using his high-level connections to avoid arrest and a trial. The kangaroo, now called \"Kangaroo Jack\", is still happily living in the [[outback]]. Now able to speak again, Jack explains why the film should end with him and closes it with his version of [[Porky Pig]]'s famous catchphrase: ''\"That's all, blokes!\"''\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Charlie Carbone\n** Robert Reid as young Charlie Carbone\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Louis Booker\n** Shawn Smith as young Louis Booker\n* [[Estella Warren]] as Jessie\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Frankie Lombardo\n** Brian Casey as young Frankie Lombardo\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Salvatore \"Sal\" Maggio\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Anna Carbone, Charlie's mother\n* [[Adam Garcia]] as Kangaroo \"Jackie Legs\" Jack (voice, uncredited)\n** [[Frank Welker]] as Jack's Vocal Effects (uncredited)\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as Mr. Smith\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Blue\n* [[Tony Nikolakopoulos]] as Sal's Capo\n* [[David Ngoombujarra]] as Sr. Sgt.

Grace gets a calling about a bridge over the Harlem River. She and Ben go there and find Adrian, who had the same calling. Grace\u2019s water breaks and Ben rushes her to the hospital. Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes). It turns out the specialist surgeon who can save both Grace and the baby is the man rescued by Adrian. Despite this, Adrian tells Ben he still does not believe the callings are ultimately good. Jared is called to the bar where Billy and other Xers are holding Zeke captive. Simon arrives with Erika and orders Zeke to be killed, which is heard by Michaela and others through the bug. This leads to Simon, Erika, Billy, and two other Xers being arrested during the police raid. Tamara accuses Jared of only getting close to her to capture the Xers which Jared denies. Adrian and Cal both have visions of three mysterious shadows of human forms.\n| LineColor       = 3F4469\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 27\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Unaccompanied Minors\n| DirectedBy      = [[Andy Wolk]]\n| WrittenBy       = Jeannine Renshaw & Marta Gen\u00e9 Camps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|23}}\n| ProdCode        = T30.10211 \n| Viewers         = 4.12<ref name=\"2.11\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-23-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.23.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = As Zeke's death date approaches, Saanvi tries to convince him she is close to a cure.

Michaela stops a teenager named Oscar fleeing a store, and he confesses to stealing a candy bar. Michaela gets a calling to \"let him go\" and does so while watching Oscar board a bus. She later learns from the bodega owner that Oscar also stole a large quantity of cold medication known to be used to cook methamphetamine. Michaela works with Jared to follow Oscar's steps, resulting in a bust at a meth lab run by ex-con Jace Baylor. Jace and his brother Pete were in cahoots with the bus driver Kory, who drove the bus that Oscar got on. At the lab, Michaela gets another calling to \"let him go\", but has to ignore it when Jace reaches for a weapon.

At a remote cabin, Pete frees Cal. Michaela, Ben and Zeke approach the cabin as Cal leads the three criminals onto a frozen lake. All fall through the ice, but Zeke jumps in, saves Cal, then dies.

Elsewhere, Saanvi ignores Vance's requests and tracks down The Major, poisoning her in hopes of gathering information. As the two struggle, a vial of antidote breaks and The Major dies. Ben has another calling in which Flight 828 explodes and crashes into the ocean. To Jared's disbelief, divers are unable to locate the bodies of the three criminals in the frozen lake.

Grace gets a calling about a bridge over the Harlem River. She and Ben go there and find Adrian, who had the same calling. Grace\u2019s water breaks and Ben rushes her to the hospital. Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes). It turns out the specialist surgeon who can save both Grace and the baby is the man rescued by Adrian. Despite this, Adrian tells Ben he still does not believe the callings are ultimately good. Jared is called to the bar where Billy and other Xers are holding Zeke captive. Simon arrives with Erika and orders Zeke to be killed, which is heard by Michaela and others through the bug. This leads to Simon, Erika, Billy, and two other Xers being arrested during the police raid. Tamara accuses Jared of only getting close to her to capture the Xers which Jared denies.

Michaela works with Jared to follow Oscar's steps, resulting in a bust at a meth lab run by ex-con Jace Baylor. Jace and his brother Pete were in cahoots with the bus driver Kory, who drove the bus that Oscar got on. At the lab, Michaela gets another calling to \"let him go\", but has to ignore it when Jace reaches for a weapon.

She further praised the series for maintaining the standard of quality it set with its premiere episode saying, \"Heavily serialized shows, such as ''Lost'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', or ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' often start with a great concept and first episode.

Previously he was the President of the [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 2006 to 2009. After resigning from that office, he went into the opposition and founded the UNC.

The city had been declared a ''[[German World War II strongholds|Festung]]'' (fortress) by Hitler, to be held to the last man. Fought from 10 to 12 September 1944, the Allied objective was to secure the harbour facilities intact, to deliver supplies to the Allied armies in [[Continental Europe]]. The Allies refused to let the civilian population be evacuated, despite offers of free passage by the fortress commander. From 26 August, [[Royal Navy]] ships and [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft carried out a blockade and an extensive preparatory bombardment of the city, which killed over 2,000 civilians and 19 German troops. The land attack was carried out by the British [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] and the [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]], aided by detachments of specialist armoured vehicles from the [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]], including Canadian troops. The German garrison of about 11,000 men surrendered on 12 September; the port was badly damaged but it was re-opened on 9 October. After the killing of so many French civilians, Allied commanders allowed the French inhabitants to leave Boulogne and other ports before attacking.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Invasion of Normandy===\n\n{{main|Operation Neptune}}\n\n[[File:TVA Marder.JPG|thumb|{{centre|''Neger'' (sic) midget submarine}}]]\nOn D-Day, 6 June 1944, Allied troops landed in [[Normandy]] on the north coast of France in [[Operation Overlord]] and began the [[Liberation of France#Liberation of France|liberation of France]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=6}} On D-Day, Allied aircraft laid a smoke screen off Le Havre to blind the coastal artillery; a torpedo-boat flotilla and a flotilla of patrol ships sailed from the port, using the smoke for camouflage. The German boats managed to fire 15 torpedoes off the Orne at 05:30, hit and sink {{HNoMS|Svenner|G03|6}} and forced several other ships to take evasive action.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=199}}{{sfn|Doherty|2004|p=125}}{{efn|In June 1944, the chief of ''Kriegsmarine'' Group Command West (Admiral [[Theodor Krancke]]) had five torpedo boats, 50 minesweepers and 21 patrol vessels at Le Havre.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=519}}}} On 6 July, Allied ships reported an \"unusual object\" passing through the Trout line, the eastern flank of the invasion area. The object was fired on, launched a torpedo and sailed away. Several more objects appeared soon after, well dispersed and were also fired on. The devices managed to sink two minesweepers for a loss of nine sunk and fifteen losses from all causes of the 26 that had sailed from Le Havre; it was later found that they were ''[[Neger]]'' midget submarines of the ''[[K-Verband]]'' (Small Battle Units).{{sfn|Doherty|2004|p=188}}{{sfn|Brown|1990|p=115}} On the night of {{nowrap|7/8 July,}} 21 ''Neger'' left Le Havre and all were sunk, most of their operators being killed, for one British minesweeper sunk and the Polish cruiser [[HMS Dragon (D46)|ORP ''Dragon'']] damaged and scuttled off Sword Beach.{{sfn|Doherty|2004|p=188}}{{sfn|Brown|1990|p=115}}[[File:Operation Astonia.jpg|thumb|British bombers over black clouds of smoke and debris bombing Le Havre|alt=|left]]\n===June\u2013August===\n[[RAF Bomber Command]] attacked Le Havre in the evening 14 June, twenty-two [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron]] Lancaster bombers and Mosquito target markers going first, to drop [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] on the [[E-boat]] (''Schnellboot, S-Boot'' [fast boat]) pens and one Tallboy penetrated the roof, which did much to eliminate the E-boat threat. The Dambusters were followed by 228 more Lancasters and three hours later a second wave of 116 aircraft arrived, {{convert|1880|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs hitting the port and anti-aircraft gun positions. The operation was the largest day raid by Bomber Command since the war began.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|1994|pp=165, 181}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=483}} By coincidence, the anti-aircraft guns at Le Havre had been prohibited from firing, to protect ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft in the area and the bombers killed about 1,000 [[Seebataillon|marines]], demoralised the survivors and destroyed about {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of shipping, comprising 9 E-boats of the 5th and 9th flotillas which were sunk, two seriously damaged one and slightly damaged, three of the five [[German torpedo boats of World War II|torpedo boats]] (similar to destroyers) in port were sunk, along with twenty minesweepers and patrol boats and nineteen tugs; several auxiliary vessels were sunk and eight other vessels were damaged.{{sfn|Saunders|Richards|1975|p=125}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=483}}\n\nAdmiral [[Theodor Krancke]], then Chief of ''Kriegsmarine'' Group Command West, called the raid a catastrophe and in the war diary wrote \"It will be hardly possible to carry out the operations planned...since yesterday's attack on Le Havre\". Some E-boats reached Le Havre in mid-June but by the end of July, only six E-boats on the channel coast were operational.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=243}} The Navy formed the Support Squadron Eastern Flank, a group of small gun-armed vessels, which came inshore during the day to bombard land targets and patrolled offshore at night. The squadron fought many engagements with E-boats and ''K-Verband''; on the night of {{nowrap|2/3 August,}} the Germans sent twenty ''Linsen'' (explosive motor boat) sorties, over fifty [[Marder (submarine)|''Marder'']] (midget submarines) and several E-boat attacks with new ''[[Dackel]]'' circling torpedoes; most of the German craft were sunk.{{sfn|Roskill|1998|pp=391\u2013392}} The night sorties by E-boats transferred to Le Havre after D-Day sank a [[Motor Torpedo Boat]], two [[Landing Ship, Tank]], three merchant ships, two landing craft and two tugs; six E-boats were sunk and ten damaged in the exchanges.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=143}}\n\n===''Festung'' Le Havre===\n\n{{See also|Operation Maple}}\n\n[[File:Baie-du-Havre 14 07 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|{{centre|Post-war view of Le Havre}}]]\nLe Havre was the most important of the [[Channel Ports]] and second only to Marseilles amongst French ports for tonnage capacity, having {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} of quays capable of receiving ocean-going ships.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=13}} In Operation Maple from early April, British aircraft and ships laid mines off Le Havre and the ports further north, which closed the port for long periods.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=108}} In early September 1944, German troops of the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|15th Army]] (General [[Gustav-Adolf von Zangen]]) occupied a swathe of coastal territory from the port to Bruges, which had been under attack by the First Canadian Army since the start of September.{{sfn|Plant|2014|p=118}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=13}} The port had water on three\nsides, the Channel to the west, the valley of the L\u00e9zarde River to the east and to the south by the estuary of the Seine estuary the Canal de Tancarville.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=332}} North of Le Havre, the ground rises steeply to high ground as far as the cliffs of Cap de la H\u00e8ve and the coast to the north. The L\u00e9zarde and Fontaine river valleys cut the area into two plateaux, the north plateau being between the rivers and the south plateau to the south and west of the Fontaine, which overlooks the port; {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland the south plateau is covered by the F\u00f4ret de Montgeon.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=13}}\n\nThe Germans had dug an anti-tank ditch from the L\u00e9zarde valley past [[Montivilliers]] to the coast at [[Octeville-sur-Mer]], covered by minefields, barbed wire and concrete defensive positions. At the crest of the southern plateau, two fortified positions covered the town and port entrance and the Grand Clos coastal artillery battery could engage approaching ships. The garrison had 115 guns, plenty of machine-guns and mortars (many of its anti-tank guns were sent to Normandy before September and lost) ammunition and supplies for 14,000 men for ninety days.{{sfn|Saunders|Richards|1975|p=190}}{{sfn|Shulman|2003|p=215}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=13}} Near Fontaine La Mallet lay Strongpoint 8, with several concrete gun emplacements, the first of a series to cover the northern approaches to the port. The minefields and tank obstacles had been hurriedly built and were superimposed on an earlier and unfinished scheme based on strongpoints. West of Strongpoint 8 the ground is unsuitable for tanks but from the strongpoint to the L\u00e9zarde the ground is flat and unobstructed, with a gentle {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}}-slope on either side, the plateaux on both sides being at the same height as the strongpoint, which commanded the stream The anti-tank ditch was V-shaped, {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide at the top and more than {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep but not continuous.{{sfn|Plant|2014|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n===Crossing the Seine===\n\n{{main|Operation Paddle|Operation Fusilade}}\n\nAllied invasion plans required that the [[First Canadian Army]] (General [[Harry Crerar]]) on the left flank of the [[21st Army Group]] (General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]]) should cross the Seine downstream of Rouen and turn left into the Le Havre peninsula and make right-handed flanking manoeuvres to capture Le Havre and its railway connexions, [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Calais]] and [[Dunkirk]], for the Allied supply effort.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=81}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=329}} On the night of 26/27 August, the crossing of the [[Seine]] by the First Canadian Army began and Rouen was captured on 30 August, [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] used every means it could improvise to get over the lower Seine which was not bridged and [[II Canadian Corps]] further upriver. The two corps were ordered to capture Le Havre and Dieppe respectively and then clear the coastal belt up to [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=465}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=6}} The German 7th Army was ordered to abandon the lower Seine and by 31 August, the 15th Army to hold a line from Dieppe to Neufch\u00e2tel but the speed of the Allied advance forced a retreat to the Somme.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=468}} In Operation Fusillade, Dieppe was entered unopposed by the [[2nd Canadian Division]] on 1 September and the 51st Highland Infantry Division walked into St-Valery, four years after most of the original Highland division had been forced to surrender there. The Highlanders joined the 49th (West Riding) Division outside Le Havre on 4 September.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=6\u20137}} As the Canadian Army prepared its attack on Le Havre, the seaward approaches were blockaded closely by the Allies navies from 26 August; the port was the most westerly still in German possession and the ''Kriegsmarine'' tried to run supplies in and get out the ships still afloat. During the next four nights convoys departing Le Havre were attacked and a few ships managed to slip away; nine ships were sunk and by 30 August the port was empty.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|pp=471\u2013472}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===German defences===\n{{Location map+ |Seine-Maritime|AlternativeMap=Seine-Maritime department relief location map.jpg|width=250|float=right |caption={{centre|Relief map of [[Le Havre]] and the [[Pays de Caux]]}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.49|long=0.1|label=[[Le Havre]]|position=bottom |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5564|long=0.1178|label=[[Octeville-sur-Mer]]|position=top |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5469|long=0.1889|label=[[Montivilliers]]|position=right |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.44|long=1.1|label=[[Rouen]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.86|long=.78|label=[[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]]|position=top |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5072|long=0.1989|label=[[Harfleur]]|position=right |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.76|long=0.38|label=[[F\u00e9camp]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.92|long=1.08|label=[[Dieppe]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5272|long=0.7269|label=[[Caudebec-en-Caux]]|position=top |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.4194|long=0.2325|label=[[Honfleur]]|position=bottom |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n}}\nOn 14 August 1944, Colonel [[Hermann-Eberhard Wildermuth]] took command of the fortress and later put the effective strength of the garrison at around 8,000 men, from a total of more than 11,000 personnel. Wildermuth had a ''[[Festungs Stamm Abteilung]]'' (fortress cadre unit) elements of the [[226th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|226th Infantry Division]] and [[245th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|245th Infantry Division]]; a battalion of Security Regiment 5, marines and some naval personnel. About 50,000 French civilians remained in the port from the normal population of about 160,000 people.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=332}} On 9 September, Wildermuth ordered that infantry attacks were to be resisted, even with pistols but when tanks attacked, strongpoints which had no anti-tank guns could surrender; rather than fight to the last man, the garrison was to resist until the last anti-tank gun.{{sfn|Shulman|2003|p=215}} Before the attack, the defenders were given an ultimatum and called upon to surrender; Wildermuth countered by requesting that civilians should be evacuated, given that his orders from Hitler were to hold ''[[Festung]]'' Le Havre to the last man. Wildermuth appealed to British humanity and repeated his offer, even after the bombing campaign started but was again refused. Crocker judged that the proposed two-day truce to get the civilians out, would take too long and delay the capture of the port.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=193}}{{efn|On moral grounds [[William Douglas-Home]], a British liaison officer, then refused an order to participate in the operation.

The city had been declared a ''[[German World War II strongholds|Festung]]'' (fortress) by Hitler, to be held to the last man. Fought from 10 to 12 September 1944, the Allied objective was to secure the harbour facilities intact, to deliver supplies to the Allied armies in [[Continental Europe]]. The Allies refused to let the civilian population be evacuated, despite offers of free passage by the fortress commander. From 26 August, [[Royal Navy]] ships and [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft carried out a blockade and an extensive preparatory bombardment of the city, which killed over 2,000 civilians and 19 German troops. The land attack was carried out by the British [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] and the [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]], aided by detachments of specialist armoured vehicles from the [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]], including Canadian troops. The German garrison of about 11,000 men surrendered on 12 September; the port was badly damaged but it was re-opened on 9 October.

The two corps were ordered to capture Le Havre and Dieppe respectively and then clear the coastal belt up to [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=465}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=6}} The German 7th Army was ordered to abandon the lower Seine and by 31 August, the 15th Army to hold a line from Dieppe to Neufch\u00e2tel but the speed of the Allied advance forced a retreat to the Somme.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|p=468}} In Operation Fusillade, Dieppe was entered unopposed by the [[2nd Canadian Division]] on 1 September and the 51st Highland Infantry Division walked into St-Valery, four years after most of the original Highland division had been forced to surrender there. The Highlanders joined the 49th (West Riding) Division outside Le Havre on 4 September.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=6\u20137}} As the Canadian Army prepared its attack on Le Havre, the seaward approaches were blockaded closely by the Allies navies from 26 August; the port was the most westerly still in German possession and the ''Kriegsmarine'' tried to run supplies in and get out the ships still afloat. During the next four nights convoys departing Le Havre were attacked and a few ships managed to slip away; nine ships were sunk and by 30 August the port was empty.{{sfn|Ellis|2004a|pp=471\u2013472}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===German defences===\n{{Location map+ |Seine-Maritime|AlternativeMap=Seine-Maritime department relief location map.jpg|width=250|float=right |caption={{centre|Relief map of [[Le Havre]] and the [[Pays de Caux]]}}|places=\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.49|long=0.1|label=[[Le Havre]]|position=bottom |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5564|long=0.1178|label=[[Octeville-sur-Mer]]|position=top |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5469|long=0.1889|label=[[Montivilliers]]|position=right |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.44|long=1.1|label=[[Rouen]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.86|long=.78|label=[[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]]|position=top |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5072|long=0.1989|label=[[Harfleur]]|position=right |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.76|long=0.38|label=[[F\u00e9camp]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.92|long=1.08|label=[[Dieppe]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.5272|long=0.7269|label=[[Caudebec-en-Caux]]|position=top |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n{{Location map~ |Seine-Maritime|lat=49.4194|long=0.2325|label=[[Honfleur]]|position=bottom |label_size=60 |marksize=6}}\n}}\nOn 14 August 1944, Colonel [[Hermann-Eberhard Wildermuth]] took command of the fortress and later put the effective strength of the garrison at around 8,000 men, from a total of more than 11,000 personnel. Wildermuth had a ''[[Festungs Stamm Abteilung]]'' (fortress cadre unit) elements of the [[226th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|226th Infantry Division]] and [[245th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|245th Infantry Division]]; a battalion of Security Regiment 5, marines and some naval personnel. About 50,000 French civilians remained in the port from the normal population of about 160,000 people.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=332}} On 9 September, Wildermuth ordered that infantry attacks were to be resisted, even with pistols but when tanks attacked, strongpoints which had no anti-tank guns could surrender; rather than fight to the last man, the garrison was to resist until the last anti-tank gun.{{sfn|Shulman|2003|p=215}} Before the attack, the defenders were given an ultimatum and called upon to surrender; Wildermuth countered by requesting that civilians should be evacuated, given that his orders from Hitler were to hold ''[[Festung]]'' Le Havre to the last man. Wildermuth appealed to British humanity and repeated his offer, even after the bombing campaign started but was again refused. Crocker judged that the proposed two-day truce to get the civilians out, would take too long and delay the capture of the port.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=193}}{{efn|On moral grounds [[William Douglas-Home]], a British liaison officer, then refused an order to participate in the operation.

The division also had the 34th Armoured Brigade and the [[1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment]] with 44 Kangaroos under command. In the I Corps plan, phase I had the 49th Division breaking through on the northern front capture strongpoints to the south and cross the Fontaine. In phase IIa the Highlanders would break through on the right and in IIb the 49th Division was to capture the southern plateau.

The operation was a model combined operation in which the British advantage in set-piece attacks backed by massed firepower was efficiently exploited. Much emphasis had been placed on maintaining the momentum of the attack and good timing, the usual caution in attack being relaxed to exploit any sign that the defenders were collapsing.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|pp=193, 195}} While there had been few Allied casualties during the operation, damage to the port infrastructure was severe, {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} of docks and 15,000 buildings had been destroyed but the port was open again by 9 October. {{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=15}} Wildermuth claimed that the lack of anti-tank guns had prevented a long defence of the port but other prisoners said that even the experience of Russia was less of an ordeal than the bombing.{{sfn|Saunders|Richards|1975|p=190}} Because of the scandal of friendly civilian casualties, Allied forces besieging Calais allowed the civilians to be evacuated before it was attacked; Dunkirk was masked until Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=59\u201360}}\n\n===Casualties===\nIn the British official history, [[Lionel Ellis]] recorded the capture of 11,300 German prisoners for fewer than 500 Allied casualties.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=15}} In 1960, Charles Stacey, the Canadian official historian, gave 11,302 prisoners and 388 casualties in I Corps.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=336}} In 2014, John Plant wrote that the 22nd Dragoons lost 29 of its 33 flail tanks and two command tanks, the 222nd Assault Squadron lost five AVRE and that six tanks were lost by the 7th RTR but that most of the damage had been caused by mines and was repairable, only eleven of the 22nd Dragoon losses being write-offs.{{sfn|Plant|2014|pp=131\u2013132}} About 2,000 French civilians and 19 Germans were killed in the air and naval bombardments.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=13\u201314}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=332}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Brown|1990}}\n|last=Brown |first=David |title=Warship Losses of World War Two |publisher=Arms and Armour |location=London |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-85368-802-0}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Buckley|2014}}\n|title=Monty's Men: The British Army and the Liberation of Europe |last=Buckley |first=J. |authorlink=John Buckley (historian) |year=2014 |orig-year=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |edition=pbk. |isbn=978-0-300-20534-3}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Copp|2006}}\n|first=Terry |last=Copp |title=Cinderella Army: The Canadians in Northwest Europe, 1944\u20131945 |year=2006 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8020-3925-5}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Doherty|2004}}\n|last=Doherty |first=R. |title=Normandy 1944: The Road to Victory |year=2004 |publisher=Spellmount |location=Staplehurst |isbn=978-1-86227-224-8}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Ellis|2004a}}\n|last1=Ellis |first1=Major L.
