The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

Over the next four decades, the Equitable and its imitators sold approximately 9 million policies \u2013 two-thirds of the nation's outstanding insurance contracts.

A physician, hoping to raise the funds to give his daughter a dowry, buys a tontine on the life of an elderly peasant, who he then strives to keep alive.\n*''The Great Tontine'' (1881), is a novel by [[Henry Hawley Smart|Hawley Smart]].\n*''[[The Wrong Box (novel)|The Wrong Box]]'' (1889), is a comic novel by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Lloyd Osbourne]]. The plot revolves around a tontine originally taken out for some wealthy English children, and the resulting shenanigans as younger family members of the two final survivors vie to secure the final payout. The book was adapted as a [[The Wrong Box|film]], produced and directed by [[Bryan Forbes]], (1966).\n*''The Secret Tontine'' (1912), is an atmospheric faux-gothic novel by [[Robert Murray Gilchrist]], set in the [[Derbyshire]] [[Peak District]] during a snowy winter in the late 19th century. The plot involves the potential beneficiaries of a covert tontine, and their scheme to murder their ignorant rivals. \n*[[Lillian de la Torre]]'s short story \"The Tontine Curse\" (1948) features mysterious deaths related to a tontine in 1779, being investigated by [[Samuel Johnson]].\n*''The Tontine'' (1955), a novel by [[Thomas B. Costain]], illustrated by [[Herbert Ryman]], is set in nineteenth-century England and tells a story centered around the fictional \"Waterloo Tontine\", established to benefit veterans of the Napoleonic wars. Among other plot twists, shareholders hire an actor to impersonate a dead nominee, and conspire to murder another member.\n*In ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957), a [[Miss Marple]] murder mystery by [[Agatha Christie]], the plot revolves around the will of a wealthy industrialist, which establishes a [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]] under which his estate is divided in trust among his grandchildren, the final survivor to inherit the whole. The settlement is described, inaccurately, as a tontine. \n*''[[Something Fishy]]'' (1957), a novel by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], features a so-called tontine under which the investors' sons stand to gain from marrying late.\n* In the U.S. television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', Episode 16 of Season Two (1966\u201367) \u2013 \"The Night of the Tottering Tontine\" \u2013 finds James West and Artemus Gordon protecting a man who is a member of a tontine whose members are being murdered one by another.\n*\"Old Soldiers,\" an eighth-season episode of the television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', focuses on a tontine set up among Colonel Potter and several of his Army buddies from [[World War I]]. While taking shelter in a ch\u00e2teau during an artillery barrage, they had found a cache of brandy and drank all but one bottle, which they set aside for the last survivor. After the only other surviving member dies, Potter receives the bottle in the mail and shares it with his staff, drinking first to his departed friends and then to the new ones he has made at the 4077th.\n*In the ''[[Barney Miller]]'' episode \"The Tontine\" (1982), one of the last two surviving family members who invested in the tontine attempts to kill himself so that the other can have the money before growing too old to enjoy it.\n* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in \"The Curse of the Flying Hellfish\"]]\" (1996), [[Grampa Simpson]] and [[Mr. Burns]] are the final survivors of a tontine to determine ownership of art looted during [[World War II]]. Grampa eventually kicks Burns out of the tontine for trying to kill him, but before he and Bart can do anything with the art, a descendant of the original owner shows up to claim it.\n*In [[S. L. Viehl]]'s science fiction multi-volume novel ''Stardoc'' (2000), the title character is accused of spreading a plague to several colony worlds, on one of which the colonists had established a tontine. The sole survivor, a little girl, consequently becomes so wealthy that in the second book of the series \u2013 ''Beyond Varallan'' (2000) \u2013 she buys the bank behind the colonies to free the Stardoc from the debt she now owes.\n*The 2001 comedy film ''[[Tomcats (2001 film)|Tomcats]]'' features a variation on a tontine where the last investor to get married gets the full amount of the invested funds.\n* In the ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' episode \"The Double Deuce\" (2011), Archer's [[valet]] Woodhouse is revealed as one of three final survivors of a group of World War I [[Royal Flying Corps]] squadron mates who each put [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 into an interest-bearing account, now worth nearly a million [[United States dollar|dollars]]. The office workers at ISIS HQ, realizing that a new tontine could capitalize on the high mortality rate of field agents, begin persuading people to join.\n* The ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' episode \"Being of Sound Mind\" (Season 8 Episode 16) features a tontine as a motive for murder.\n*The ''[[The Brokenwood Mysteries|Brokenwood Mysteries]]'' episode \"Tontine\" (Season 5 Episode 3) centres on a tontine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Buley|first=R.

The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure). Due to the vias geometry, this distance cannot be utilized directly; because of the space between successive vias and their circular shape, the signal inside the guide does not behave exactly as it would in a perfectly rectangular waveguide of the same width.\n\nTo apply waveguide theory to SIWs, an effective width <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>can be used.

It premiered on January 12, 2020 on [[Sveriges Television]]. It became the most-viewed series ever on [[SVT Play]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/endemol-shine-caliphate-breaks-all-time-records-svt-play-1234574452/ |title=Endemol Shine\u2019s \u2018Caliphate\u2019 Breaks All-Time Records on SVT Play |date=April 8, 2020 |first=John |last=Hopewell |newspaper=Variety}}</ref>\n\nThe story is based on Fatima, an agent of the [[Swedish Security Service]], who receives a tip that a terror attack is being planned in Sweden.\n\nAll eight episodes were directed by [[Goran Kapetanovi\u0107]].\n\n\"Caliphate\" was made available globally on [[Netflix]] on March 18.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story starts with Pervin, a young woman from Sweden who lives in Raqqa, Syria, with her husband Husam. They have a young daughter. Disillusioned with life in Raqqa, Pervin is looking to return to Sweden. After acquiring a cell phone from her neighbor and friend, she contacts Dolores, an antiradicalization advocate, in Sweden. Dolores puts Pervin in touch with Fatima, who is an agent of Swedish Security Service. Fatima is at odds with the leadership due to some previous incident with \"Lorentz\". Fatima starts talking with Pervin over the phone and tries to work her for intelligence related to a terror attack being planned in Sweden in exchange for safe return for Pervin and her daughter to Sweden.\n\nPervin tells Fatima about \"Al Musafir\" or the Traveler, who is in Sweden and is planning the attack. Al Musafir is Ibrahim \"Ibbe\" Haddad who is working as a teachers assistant in a Muslim highschool, while recruiting others like Jacob, Emil and Miryam into the terror attack. He simultaneously tries to radicalize young girls at the high school by sharing recruitment videos and propaganda. He successfully recruits Sulle and her friend Kerima, both 15yr old girls who start wearing the hijab and taking lessons in following the righteous path. The girls are shown pictures of palaces and told that if they moved to the Caliphate, they could live in luxury and be part of something special. Sulle's parents wisen up to their daughters radicalization and try to stop her unsuccessfully. Sulle inadvertently pulls her 13 yr old sister Lisha into the ideology, the implications of which are not fully realized until later in the show.\n\nFatima does not reveal her source (Pervin) to her superiors, but does reveal vague details about a terror plot. Her superiors tell her to drop the investigation and have her suspended for consuming cannabis. She remains in touch with her lover in the Security Service, Calle and continues to share information with him. She continues extracting information from Pervin and tries to piece together details of the plot. She gets on Jacob and Emils trail when she happens to be at an abandoned shooting range that she hears of from Pervin. Jacob gets her license plate and tracks it down.\n\nDolores and Ibbe are at an anti-radicalization meeting, when Ibbe steps out to talk with Jacob. The host shows an ISIS video and points to a tattoo on the forearm of one of the terrorists. Later while at a cafe, Dolores sees the tattoo on Ibbe's arm. After Ibbe drops her off, she calls Fatima who asks her to meet her at her apartment. When she goes there, she gets stabbed and dies. When Fatima arives, an alert has been issued to bring her in and she plans to escape. She goes to Dolores's house to get some cash and supplies, but two Swedish cops end up there. She locks them in a bathroom under gun point, which triggers a manhunt for her. She finds shelter at the home of her dad's colleague.\n\nPervin becomes the focus of attention for one of Husams colleagues (Ahmed), who arrives one night to her house and catches her talking to Fatima. He rapes her and is about to kill her when she stabs him. She throws his body into her neighbors well. Husam is under the influence of sleeping medicines and happens to walk into the kitchen and see the blood on the floor, but Pervin convinces him that he is dreaming. He never quite forgets and becomes convinced that he killed Ahmed, until Pervin finally tells him the truth.\n\nFatima seeks helps to extricate Pervin and a plan is set to remove her from Raqqa. Meanwhile, Sulle and Kerima have tickets to travel to Turkey and are picked up by Ibbe and the woman who has been teaching them about Islam. At the last minute, Sulle's younger sister Lisha joins them in the car and they set off for the airport. Sulle lied to her parents about going to a basketball game. Her dad finishes work early and decides to go and watch her game but sees that the stadium is empty. He calls Calle who sets off an alert with authorities in Germany and Turkey. They believe they have tracked the girls on their way to Istanbul only to realize that the passports had been switched and that the girls were in fact in Ankara. They decide to intercept the transport vehicle at the border between Turkey and Syria. They manage to rescue everyone except for Lisha who is en route to Syria.\n\nCalle convinces Fatima to seek help from Pervin to save Lisha. Pervin and her daughter have reached their transport vehicle when Fatima convinces her to return home and save Lisha. In return Fatima would personnaly come to Syria to rescue them all. Pervin convinces Husam to take Lisha on as his second wife. \n\nFatima is trailing Jacob and Emil but loses their trail after they switch cars at their mothers house. Fatima learns of the three terror targets minutes before the police close in on her location and she is taken into custody before she can share any information. In return for the information she promises to extricate Husam along with Pervin and Lisha. All three terror attacks are stopped anyway by the Security Service, who knew about them all along. They kept Fatima in the dark because they did not trust her. In exchange for her silence, she is released from jail. Ibbe escapes narrowly.\n\nFatima travels to Syria to rescue Pervin, Lisha, and Husam. Minutes before she arrives, Husam's colleague arrives to take Husam for a suicide bombing. Husam tries to buy time but Lisha, who is completely radicalized and unwilling to return to Sweden, reveals their escape plan. Husam's colleague shoots Pervin and is about to shoot Husam when Fatima shoots him. They quickly move to the car but Lisha does not join, so they leave her behind. They make it outside Raqqa but Fatima dies just after the border post. Husam carries his daughter and they make it back to Sweden. \n\nSulle and Kerima are being interrogated by the Security Service. Sulle gives up Ibbe's identity in an effort to save her sister Lisha. Kerima tries to commit suicide and is taken to a mental health facility where she gets her hands on a cell phone and warms Ibbe that his cover may be blown. Calle is at the school to bring Ibbe into custody, but Ibbe escapes. Kerima meets up with Ibbe and decides to participate in a new attack on a girls concert. Kerima is to wear a suicide vest that she cannot remove once she puts it on. Ibbe convinces Kerima that Sulle and he were also part of the attack and would be wearing similar suicide vests. Kerima texts Sulle after putting on the suicide vest only to learn that Ibbe had lied. She warns all the attendees who flee and waits for the bomb to explode. Ibbe triggers the bomb.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Gizem Erdogan]] \u2013 Pervin El Kaddouri\n* [[Aliette Opheim]] \u2013 Fatima Zukic\n* [[Nora Rios]] \u2013 Suleika \"Sulle\" Wasem\n* [[Amed Bozan]] \u2013 Husam El Kaddouri\n* [[Yussra El Abdouni]] \u2013 Lisha Wasem\n* [[Arvin Kananian]] \u2013 Nadir Al-Shahrani\n* [[Lancelot Ncube]] \u2013 Ibrahim \"Ibbe\" Haddad\n* [[William Legue]] \u2013 Omar Soudani\n* [[Simon Mezher]] \u2013 Suleiman Wasem\n* [[Amanda Sohrabi]] \u2013 Kerima\n* [[Albin Grenholm]] \u2013 Calle\n* [[Marcus V\u00f6geli]] \u2013 Jakob Johannisson\n* [[Nils Wetterholm]] \u2013 Emil Johannisson\n\n* [[Ala Riani]] \u2013 Tuba Wasem\n* [[Dennis \u00d6nder]] \u2013 Abu Jibril\n* [[Shada Helin-Sulhav]] \u2013 Miryam\n* [[Marcel Khouri]] \u2013 Ahmed Mohamedi\n* [[Monica Albornoz]] \u2013 Dolores\n* [[Camilla Larsson]] \u2013 Sara\n* [[Jonatan Qahoush]] \u2013 Khalaf\n* [[Caisa Ankarsparre]] \u2013 Nyhetsankare\n* [[Ali Jalal]] \u2013 Ali Chatik\n* [[Ahmad Srour]] \u2013 Emiren\n* [[Maria Alm Norell]] \u2013 Anna-Karin\n* [[Nadeem Srouji]] \u2013 Karwan\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Netflix title|80240005}}\n*{{IMDb title|11398870}}\n\n[[Category:2020 television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Swedish drama television series]]\n[[Category:Sveriges Television programmes]]\n", "text_old": "'''''Caliphate''''' (Swedish: ''Kalifat'') is a 2020 Swedish thriller drama TV series.

The film's narrator is a French doctor ([[Henri Vidal]]) who has been kidnapped to tend a sick woman, Hilde Garosi ([[Florence Marly]]), the wife of one man and the lover of another, both aboard. The doctor realizes he will be murdered at any point once the woman has recovered so he tries various stratagems to escape. All fail.\n\nThe mission slowly disintegrates as the war ends and its reasons for being dissipate, with some passengers either trying to escape or committing suicide. Forster ([[Jo Dest]]) tries to continue the mission even after Berlin has fallen and orders have gone out for all U-boats to surrender at the nearest port.
