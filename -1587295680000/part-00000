While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[1896]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds 13 year old [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

But when she arrives at Green Gables, she discovers it was a mistake. Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, the aging siblings that run the farm, had sent for a boy. While Matthew immediately likes the girl, Marilla is determined to send her back, but changes her mind when she gets a glimpse of what Anne's life would be. She agrees to a trial period of one week and Anne is determined to show the Cuthberts that she will be useful on the farm. When their neighbor Mrs. Lynde calls her homely, skinny and redhaired, she loses her temper. Marilla says that Anne must apologize; she is determined not to do so as she is not sorry, but Matthew convinces her to ask Mrs. Lynde for forgiveness, which she does in a dramatical manner.\nMatthew hires a French boy to help with the farm work.\nWhen Anne and Marilla are invited to tea by the Barrys, Anne meets their daughter Diana and they swear to be best friends forever and ever. \nUpon returning home, Marilla asks Anne to put away her scarf and a treasured brooch, with which Anne plays.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[1896]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds 13 year old [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record.

The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous. Another attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2002|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that United Artists themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"It's a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt ''[[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|Dune]]'', but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Unproduced attempts to film ''Dune'' involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[Pierre Morel]].</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. [[Ringo Starr]] wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, Ringo as Sam, and Harrison as Gandalf.

When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol.

He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter.

Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about television spin-off shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers).

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=March 7, 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous. Another attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2002|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that United Artists themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"It's a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt ''[[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|Dune]]'', but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Unproduced attempts to film ''Dune'' involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[Pierre Morel]].</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. [[Ringo Starr]] wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, Ringo as Sam, and Harrison as Gandalf. [[Donovan]] was keen on Merry, and they wanted [[Twiggy]] for Galadriel and \"a lot of other people\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcall.com/sd-me-music-beatles-lord-of-the-rings-20180731-story.html|title=Help!

Kubrick's own films never exceeded the three-hour runtime before, and splitting the story (an approach considered with such widescreen epics as ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' around that time) would have been risky given that 60s widescreen epics rarely had sequels, and the nature of the story would result in the first part feeling unresolved.

Some cell animation was produced by the time Goeff Dunbar and Oscar Grillo of Euronimation bowed out. Rankin then outsourced the animation to Japan's Topcraft (later [[Studio Ghibli|Studio Ghilbi]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intanibase.com/forum/posts/m25152findunread-Middle-Earth-in-Animation|title=Middle Earth in Animation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe designs were done by Rankin, Bass and several Japanese animators working the United States. Lester Abrams sent Rankin 20 character designs after Rankin and Bass liked his work on an excerpt of Tolkien's for ''Children's Digest'' at the time.

When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\" and that his script would have made for a cheap film like \"a Roger Corman film\".<ref name=\":8\" /> He would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Medavoy didn't want to produce Bakshi's film, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman's script.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors.

The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nWith Conkling, Bakshi considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some inconsistencies like the spelling of Saruman's (originally changed to Ruman to avoid confusion with Sauron) name in the film. Fans were threatening Bakshi to get it right, and he would constantly revise the story to include certain beats at the behest of such fans.<ref name=\":34\">{{Cite book|last=Ash|first=Roger|title=Modern Masters Volume 19: Mike Ploog|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}</ref>\n\nBakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action, and while Bakshi's contract allowed this, he said it couldn't be done and that he'd \"always seen it as animation.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about television spin-off shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

Visual effects were again managed by [[Weta Digital]], but [[Joe Letteri]] (a Rings veteran) replaced [[Jim Rygiel]] as animation supervisor. \n\nFollowing the release of ''The Battle of the Five Armies'', Freeman reprised his role as Bilbo Baggins in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch known interchangeably either as ''The Office: Middle Earth'' or ''The Hobbit Office'', alongside [[Bobby Moynihan]], [[Taran Killam]], [[Kyle Mooney]], and [[Kate McKinnon]] as Gandalf, Gollum, Legolas and Tauriel respectively as they take up office jobs. The skit explains that during the events of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tauriel remained working at this office. The skit is based on the fact that Freeman starred in the [[The Office (U.K. TV series)|British series of ''The Office'']] as [[Tim Canterbury]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg8NS6s0fkw|title=Hobbit Office - SNL|date=December 14, 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Crew===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"| Crew\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Peter Jackson's films\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n|-\n!
