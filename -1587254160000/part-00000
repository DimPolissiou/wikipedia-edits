In the \"Formation\" video, the walls of the plantation houses are covered with [[French Renaissance|French Renaissance-]]<nowiki/>style portraits of black subjects; director [[Melina Matsoukas]] states that \"films about slavery traditionally feature white people in these roles of power and position. I wanted to turn those images on their head.\" In the \"Freedom\" video, Beyonc\u00e9 and several black women are in a planation, with Chris Kelly writing \"Instead of an antebellum memory, these scenes portray a dream: the fantasy of an all-black, matriarchal utopia when women dress up, prepare meals, take photographs and perform shows, not for a master but for themselves.\"<ref name=\":26\" /> On \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 samples [[Led Zeppelin]]\u2019s \"[[When the Levee Breaks]]\".

The arc begins with \"[[Pray You Catch Me]]\", with Beyonc\u00e9 suspecting her husband of infidelity. On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 asks \"What are you doing, my love?\". She is in denial of the affair in \"[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]\", but spills over into anger on \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", telling him \"If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife\". Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Love Drought]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama.

[[Kendrick Lamar]]'s verse also contains many political allusions, including the lyrics \"Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona, six headlights wavin' in my direction\"; both Beyonc\u00e9 and Lamar faced backlash for their respective songs \"[[Formation (song)|Formation]]\" and \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\", with some critics misconstruing the songs' messages of hope and anti-[[police brutality]] and claiming the artists were instead inciting violence and hatred.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\".

Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\".

The arc begins with \"[[Pray You Catch Me]]\", with Beyonc\u00e9 suspecting her husband of infidelity. On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 asks \"What are you doing, my love?\". She is in denial of the affair in \"[[Hold Up (song)|Hold Up]]\", but spills over into anger on \"[[Don't Hurt Yourself (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Don't Hurt Yourself]]\", telling him \"If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife\". Beyonc\u00e9 is apathetic about the relationship in \"[[Sorry (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Sorry]]\", deciding to leave her husband and telling him \"I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away\" and saying \"He better call Becky with the good hair\". Beyonc\u00e9 expresses emptiness on \"[[6 Inch]]\", but shows signs of vulnerability as she ends the track with a repetition of \"Come back, come back\". On \"[[Daddy Lessons]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 connects Jay-Z to her father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who cheated on Beyonc\u00e9's mother [[Tina Knowles|Tina]], and contemplates if she can forgive her husband as she forgave her father. On \"[[Love Drought]]\", Beyonc\u00e9 reaches out to Jay-Z, professing her love and making a plea to him. Beyonc\u00e9 relates how she can't live without her husband, telling him \"Your heart is broken 'cause I walked away. Show me your scars and I won't walk away, and I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby. Every promise don't work out that way\". Beyonc\u00e9 decides on moving ahead with her husband on \"[[Forward (song)|Forward]]\", while on \"[[Freedom (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|Freedom]]\" Beyonc\u00e9 relates her overcoming of her challenges to that of African-American women. The arc ends with \"[[All Night (Beyonc\u00e9 song)|All Night]]\", where Beyonc\u00e9 sings \"They say true love's the greatest weapon to win the war caused by pain, but every diamond has imperfections, but my love's too pure to watch it chip away\". On the outro of the track, Beyonc\u00e9 says \"How I missed you, my love\", mirroring the outro of the album opener, with the two phrases bookending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s emotional rollercoaster. \"Formation\" is a [[black pride]] anthem, with Beyonc\u00e9 celebrating her Deep Southern heritage and culture, such as in the lyrics \"My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana, you mix that [[negro]] with that [[Creole peoples|Creole]], make a Texas bama.

[[Kendrick Lamar]]'s verse also contains many political allusions, including the lyrics \"Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona, six headlights wavin' in my direction\"; both Beyonc\u00e9 and Lamar faced backlash for their respective songs \"[[Formation (song)|Formation]]\" and \"[[Alright (Kendrick Lamar song)|Alright]]\", with some critics misconstruing the songs' messages of hope and anti-[[police brutality]] and claiming the artists were instead inciting violence and hatred.<ref>{{Citation|title=Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

Lauding both the film and album, Tate writes \"Visually, literarily, choreographically, cinematically, this full accessing of her Southern bona fides shows up in the HBO project as ritual evidence that Bey\u2019s spent her downtime delving into the avant-garde mysticism of [[Black feminism|black-feminist]] poetry, novel writing, dance, gallery art, and film... The album, however, is out to sonorously suck you into its gully gravitational orbit the old fashioned way, placing the burden of conjuration on its steamy witches' brew of beats, melodies, and heavy-hearted-to-merry-pranksterish vocal seductions. In her mastery of carnal and esoteric mysteries, Queen Bey raises the spirits, sizzles the flesh, and rallies her troops.\"<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Tate|authorlink=Greg Tate|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/review-beyonce-lemonade/|title=Review: Beyonc\u00e9 Is the Rightful Heir to Michael Jackson and Prince on 'Lemonade'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=April 28, 2016|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writer Andy Kellman called ''Lemonade'' \"culturally seismic\" through its \"layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere\", adding that \"the cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyonc\u00e9's contemporaries.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic Review\" />\n\nIn a five-star review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] calls ''Lemonade'' \"a welcome reminder that giants still walk among us\", describing it as an \"album of emotional discord and marital meltdown... from the most respected and creative artist in the pop game\". Sheffield writes \"''Lemonade'' is her most emotionally extreme music, but also her most sonically adventurous... Yet the most astounding sound is always Bey\u2019s voice\", which is described as \"her wildest, rawest vocals ever\". Sheffield also compares ''Lemonade'' to [[Aretha Franklin]]\u2019s ''[[Spirit in the Dark]]'' and [[Nina Simone]]\u2019s ''[[Silk & Soul|Silk and Soul]]'' in the way that the album \"reach[es] out historically, connecting her personal pain to the trauma of American blackness\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beyonce-lemonade-20160425|title=Lemonade|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Rob|last=Sheffield|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=April 26, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531061410/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beyonce-lemonade-20160425|archivedate=May 31, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Ray Rahman for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' agrees, writing that ''Lemonade'' is \"a raw and intensely personal plunge into the heart of marital darkness\" as well as \"a feminist blueprint, a tribute to women, African-Americans, and, especially, African-American women\".

It went on the market in March 2005. It comes in three versions, all of which ingest raw data: ''GRLevel2'' and ''GRLevel2 Analyst Edition'' for viewing Level II data of the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS), and ''GRLevel3'' for viewing Level III data. All programs are capable of rendering [[Weather radar#Polarization|dual polarization]] data.\n\nThe software allows the user to view real-time data as well as archive data stored locally or obtained over the internet. It is used by professional forecasters and researchers for general [[precipitation]] analysis as well as severe storm, [[tornado]], and [[tropical cyclone]] monitoring and analysis. Its usage base grew to include many television weathercasters, including by [[The Weather Channel]] severe storms expert [[Gregory S. Forbes|Greg Forbes]], as well as [[Storm chasing|storm chasers]], [[Storm spotting|storm spotters]], [[Emergency management|emergency managers]], weather enthusiasts, private sector meteorologists, and is often used within the NWS, itself.\n\n''GRLevel2 Analyst Edition'' allows the user to take a 3D images of precipitation within clouds, such as in [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]]s. It's integrated algorithms flag possible [[hail]], [[tornado vortex signature]]s (TVSs), and [[mesocyclone]]s. \n\nAll GRx applications are written in [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] [[C++]] using the base [[Windows API]]s. Software engineer Michael Scott Gibson wrote the programs.<ref>[http://www.grlevelx.com/about.htm About GRLevelX]</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\n''GRLevel2'' is a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] viewer for live and archived [[NEXRAD]] Level II data (volumetric reflectivity and velocity data<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/quickstart/RadarLevelII.html |title= Level II Radar |publisher= [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] |date= 2009 |accessdate= 2009-10-23}}</ref>). Base reflectivity, base velocity, storm relative velocity, and spectrum width sweeps for all [[radar]] tilts can be ingested. The display has high speed zooming and panning to allow the user a quickly focus on the area of interest. \n\n''GRLevel2 Analyst Edition'' is an advanced NEXRAD Level II analysis application to produce a high quality [[volumetric display]] and several high resolution reflectivity-derived graphical products in addition to the standard Level II data products. Through [[GIS]] implementation, several University-Doppler Radars, such as Missouri states [[X-Band]] [[Radar]] can be viewed.\n\n''GRLevel3'' is a Windows viewer for live NEXRAD Level III data from the NWS Radar Product Central Collection Dissemination Service (already produced 2D images<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/quickstart/RadarLevelII.html |title= Level III Radar |publisher= [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] |date= 2009 |accessdate= 2009-10-23}}</ref>). In addition to Level III WSR-88D data, GR3 supports [[Terminal Doppler Weather Radar|TDWR]], which is high resolution shorter range radar located at some major airports.\n\nGibson also wrote ''GREarth'', which overlays [[Weather satellite|satellite]] and other data and, like the GRLevelX radar viewers, is customizable with [[Geographic information system|GIS]] layers.<ref>[http://www.grlevelx.com/manuals/grearth/ GREarth User Guide]</ref>\n\n=== Algorithms ===\n{{Main|Weather radar|Convective storm detection#Radar{{!}}Convective storm detection by radar}}\n''GR2Analyst'' contains [[algorithm]]s flagging certain features in the [[reflectivity]] data. In reflectivities, ''GR2'' extract the height above ground of the highest elevation where they are greater than 18 dBZ (echo tops), the [[vertically integrated liquid]] water content of clouds (VIL) and the VIL divided by the Echo tops which is an indicator of possible large hail. Further algorithm use environmental information about of {{convert|0|C}} and {{convert|-20|C}} heights, inputted by the user, to output a hail algorithm size.

It went on the market in March 2005. It comes in three versions, all of which ingest raw data: ''GRLevel2'' and ''GRLevel2 Analyst Edition'' for viewing Level II data of the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS), and ''GRLevel3'' for viewing Level III data. All programs are capable of rendering [[Weather radar#Polarization|dual polarization]] data.\n\nThe software allows the user to view real-time data as well as archive data stored locally or obtained over the internet. It is used by professional forecasters and researchers for general [[precipitation]] analysis as well as severe storm, [[tornado]], and [[tropical cyclone]] monitoring and analysis. Its usage base grew to include many television weathercasters, including by [[The Weather Channel]] severe storms expert [[Gregory S. Forbes|Greg Forbes]], as well as [[Storm chasing|storm chasers]], [[Storm spotting|storm spotters]], [[Emergency management|emergency managers]], weather enthusiasts, private sector meteorologists, and is often used within the NWS, itself.\n\n''GRLevel2 Analyst Edition'' allows the user to take a 3D images of precipitation within clouds, such as in [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]]s. It's integrated algorithms flag possible [[hail]], [[tornado vortex signature]]s (TVSs), and [[mesocyclone]]s. \n\nAll GRx applications are written in [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] [[C++]] using the base [[Windows API]]s. Software engineer Michael Scott Gibson wrote the programs.<ref>[http://www.grlevelx.com/about.htm About GRLevelX]</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\n''GRLevel2'' is a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] viewer for live and archived [[NEXRAD]] Level II data (volumetric reflectivity and velocity data<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/quickstart/RadarLevelII.html |title= Level II Radar |publisher= [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] |date= 2009 |accessdate= 2009-10-23}}</ref>). Base reflectivity, base velocity, storm relative velocity, and spectrum width sweeps for all [[radar]] tilts can be ingested. The display has high speed zooming and panning to allow the user a quickly focus on the area of interest. \n\n''GRLevel2 Analyst Edition'' is an advanced NEXRAD Level II analysis application to produce a high quality [[volumetric display]] and several high resolution reflectivity-derived graphical products in addition to the standard Level II data products. Through [[GIS]] implementation, several University-Doppler Radars, such as Missouri states [[X-Band]] [[Radar]] can be viewed.\n\n''GRLevel3'' is a Windows viewer for live NEXRAD Level III data from the NWS Radar Product Central Collection Dissemination Service (already produced 2D images<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/quickstart/RadarLevelII.html |title= Level III Radar |publisher= [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] |date= 2009 |accessdate= 2009-10-23}}</ref>). In addition to Level III WSR-88D data, GR3 supports [[Terminal Doppler Weather Radar|TDWR]], which is high resolution shorter range radar located at some major airports.\n\nGibson also wrote ''GREarth'', which overlays [[Weather satellite|satellite]] and other data and, like the GRLevelX radar viewers, is customizable with [[Geographic information system|GIS]] layers.<ref>[http://www.grlevelx.com/manuals/grearth/ GREarth User Guide]</ref>\n\n=== Algorithms ===\n{{Main|Weather radar|Convective storm detection#Radar{{!}}Convective storm detection by radar}}\n''GR2Analyst'' contains [[algorithm]]s flagging certain features in the [[reflectivity]] data. In reflectivities, ''GR2'' extract the height above ground of the highest elevation where they are greater than 18 dBZ (echo tops), the [[vertically integrated liquid]] water content of clouds (VIL) and the VIL divided by the Echo tops which is an indicator of possible large hail. Further algorithm use environmental information about of {{convert|0|C}} and {{convert|-20|C}} heights, inputted by the user, to output a hail algorithm size. The algorithm uses any temp/height data within 48 hours of the volume scan time. If no recent data is found, it defaults to {{convert|10000|ft}} and {{convert|20000|ft}} for the heights.\n\nThe results are displayed with a high resolution of {{convert|1|km}} x 1 \u00b0 x {{convert|230|km}} grid with 256 data levels. There is an automatic extraction of the storm motion which is integrated in the algorithms for corrections.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.grlevelx.com/manuals/ Manuals]\n* [http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/glossary.htm Meteorology dictionary] (NWS)\n\n[[Category:Graphic software in meteorology]]\n", "name_user": "Pierre cb", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRLevelX"}
