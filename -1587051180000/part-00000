{"title_page": "1950s quiz show scandals", "text_new": "The American quiz show scandals of the 1950s were a series of revelations that contestants of several popular [[Game show|television quiz shows]] were secretly given assistance by show producers, to prearrange the outcome of ostensibly fair competitions. The 1950s quiz show scandals were driven by a variety of reasons, including greed, willing contestants, and the lack of regulations prohibiting such conspiracy in game show productions.<ref name=\"Venanzi\">{{cite web|author=Venanzi, Katie|date=1997|url=http://www.plosin.com/beatbegins/projects/venanzi.html|title=An Examination of Television Quiz Show Scandals of the 1950s|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1954, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''Federal Communications Commission v.

The prizes of these new shows were unprecedented. ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'' became the first big-money [[television]] quiz show during the 1950s. In 1955, [[Joyce Brothers]] first earned fame by becoming the first woman to earn the $64,000 prize. It was revealed later that the show was \u201ccontrolled\u201d; the producers did not want her to win and deliberately gave her questions perceived to be beyond her ability, which she answered correctly anyway. ''The $64,000 Question'' was one of the game shows ultimately implicated to be fixed in some fashion.<ref name=\"Venanzi\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fiftiesweb.com/tv/quizshow/|title=Quiz Shows of the Fifties - Twenty-One, $64,000 Question.

That initial broadcast was, in the words of co-producer [[Dan Enright]], \"a dismal failure\"; the first two contestants succeeded only in making a mockery of the format by showing how little they really knew by guessing many questions incorrectly. Show sponsor [[Geritol]], upon seeing this opening-night performance, reportedly became furious with the results, and said in no uncertain terms that they did not want to see a repeat performance.<ref name=\":0\"/> According to Enright in a 1992 PBS documentary, \"from that moment on, we decided to rig ''Twenty-One.''\" \n\nThree months into its run, ''Twenty-One'' featured a contestant, [[Herb Stempel]], who had been coached by producer [[Dan Enright]] to allow his opponent, [[Charles Van Doren]], to win the game. Stempel took the fall as requested. A year later, Stempel told the ''[[New York Journal-American]]''{{'}}s [[Jack O'Brian]] that his winning run as champion on the series had been choreographed to his advantage, and that the show's producer then ordered him to purposely lose his championship to Van Doren. With no proof, an article was never printed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/filmmore/transcript/|title=The American Experience {{!}} Quiz Show Scandal {{!}} Program Transcript|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nStempel's statements gained more credibility when [[match fixing]] in another game, ''[[Dotto]],'' was publicized in August 1958. Quiz show ratings across the networks plummeted and several were cancelled amid allegations of fixing. The revelations were sufficient to initiate a nine-month long [[County of New York]] [[grand jury]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/quizshowsca.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Quiz Show Scandals|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref> No indictments were handed down, and the findings of the grand jury were sealed by judge's order.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal59-1334528|title=TV Quiz Shows|last=|first=|date=1959|publisher=CQ Almanac|access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref> A formal congressional subcommittee investigation began in summer 1959.<ref name=\":1\" /> Enright was revealed to have rigged ''Twenty-One''; Van Doren also eventually came forth with revelations about how he was persuaded to accept specific answers during his time on the show.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Gross, L. S. (2013). ''Electronic media: An introduction''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> These elements of the scandal were portrayed in the 1994 movie ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]].'' As a result, many contestants' reputations were tarnished.\n\nIn 1960, the [[United States Congress]] amended the [[Communications Act of 1934]] to prohibit the fixing of quiz shows. As a result of that action, many networks canceled their existing quiz shows and replaced them with a higher number of [[public service]] programs.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Most networks also imposed a winnings and appearances limit on their existing and future game shows, which would eventually be removed by inflation and the rise of the million-dollar jackpot game shows starting in 1999.\n\n==Revelation==\nStempel was a contestant on ''Twenty-One'' who was coached by Enright. While Stempel was in the midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but ''Twenty-One'' did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner, Albert Freedman, were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Van Doren, who was an English teacher at [[Columbia University]] when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]].'' Enright, who produced both ''Tic-Tac-Dough'' and ''Twenty-One,'' saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be the perfect contestant to be the new face of ''Twenty-One.''<ref>Anderson, Kent. Television Fraud: The History and Implications of the Quiz Show Scandals. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood, 1978. Print.</ref> As part of their plan, the producers of ''Twenty-One'' arranged the first Van Doren-Stempel face-off to end in three ties. As prize money per-point in the margin of victory increased by $500 after each tie game, the next game would offer $2,000 for every point the winner led by; this was duly-noted in promotion of the following week's episode, which helped to attract significant viewership. After achieving winnings of $69,500, Stempel's scripted loss to the more popular Van Doren occurred on December 5, 1956. One of the questions Stempel answered incorrectly involved the winner of the [[27th Academy Awards|1955]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Motion Picture]] (the correct answer was ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]],'' one of Stempel's favorite movies; as instructed by Enright, Stempel gave the incorrect answer ''[[On the Waterfront]],'' winner of Best Motion Picture the [[26th Academy Awards|previous year]]).\n\nAlthough the manipulation of the contestants on ''Twenty-One'' helped the producers maintain viewer interest and ratings, the producers had not anticipated the extent of Stempel's resentment at being required to lose the contest against Van Doren.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Anderson, K. (1978). Television fraud: The history and implications of the quiz show scandals. Westport and London: Greenwood Press.</ref> After his preordained loss, Stempel spoke out against the operation, claiming that he deliberately lost the match against Van Doren on orders from Enright.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Initially, Stempel was dismissed as a sore loser, due in part to the fact that there was no solid reason to question the reputations of the quiz shows themselves. In August 1958, the abrupt cancellation of the quiz show ''Dotto'' bolstered his credibility when Edward Hilgemeier, Jr, a stand-by contestant three months earlier, sent an affidavit to the Federal Communications Commission claiming that while backstage, he had found a notebook containing the very answers contestant [[Marie Winn]] was delivering on stage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/154370718|title=28 Aug 1958, Page 6 - The News Journal at Newspapers.com|newspaper=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref> Although the reason for ''Dotto''<nowiki/>{{'}}s August cancellation was never given to the press, it was worked out in the days after that the reason was the implication that the game had been fixed. The story of fixing was widely known soon after. The American public's reactions were quick and powerful when the quiz show fraud became public: between 87% and 95% knew about the scandals as measured by industry-sponsored polls.<ref name=\"BoddyFiftiesTelevision\">Boddy, W.(1990). Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.</ref> Over the course of the second half of 1958, quiz shows implicated by the scandal were canceled rapidly. Among them, with their cancellation dates, were the following shows:\n* ''Dotto'' (August 16)\n* ''The $64,000 Challenge'' (September 14)\n* ''Twenty-One'' (October 16)\n* ''The $64,000 Question'' (November 9)\n* ''Tic-Tac-Dough,'' primetime edition (December 29)\nLate in August, New York prosecutor Joseph Stone convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate the allegations of the fixing of quiz shows. At the time of the empaneling, neither being a party to a fixed game show nor fixing a game show in the first place were crimes in their own right. Some witnesses in the grand jury acknowledged their role in a fixed show, while others denied it, directly contradicting one another. Many of the coached contestants, who had become celebrities due to their quiz show success, were so afraid of the social repercussions of admitting the fraud that they were unwilling to confess to having been coached, even to the point of perjuring themselves to avoid backlash. Show producers, who had legally rigged the games to increase ratings but did not want to implicate themselves, the show sponsors or the networks they worked for in doing so, categorically denied the allegations. After the nine-month grand jury, no indictments were handed down and the judge sealed the grand jury report in Summer 1959.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[86th United States Congress]], by then in its first session, soon responded; in October 1959, the [[House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight]], under Representative [[Oren Harris]]' chairmanship, began to hold hearings investigating the scandal. Stempel, Snodgrass and Hilgemeier all testified.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/investigationoft01unit|title=Investigation of television quiz shows.

The gravity of the scandal was confirmed on November 2, 1959 when Van Doren said to the Committee in a nationally televised session that, \"I was involved, deeply involved, in a deception. The fact that I, too, was very much deceived cannot keep me from being the principal victim of that deception, because I was its principal symbol.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/investigationoft02unit|title=Investigation of television quiz shows.

The Act and regulations written by the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) were indefinite in regards to fixed television programs. Due to the fact that there were no specific laws regarding the fraudulent behavior in the quiz shows, it is debatable whether the producers or contestants alike did anything illegal. Instead, it could be inferred that the medium was ill-used.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> After concluding the Harris Commission investigation, Congress amended the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]] to prohibit the fixing of televised contests of intellectual knowledge or skill<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/509- 47 U.S.C. \u00a7509].</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last=Roth| first=Gary Franklin |date= September 1972 |title= The Quizzes and the Law: Fifteen Years after \u201cTwenty-One\u201d How Far Can They Go?| url= https://doi.org/10.1080/00315249.1972.9943360| journal= Performing Arts Review| volume=3| issue=4| pages=629\u2013654| doi= 10.1080/00315249.1972.9943360| issn=0031-5249}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, the bill that [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] signed into law on September 13, 1960, was a fairly mild improvement to the broadcast industry.{{according to whom|date=April 2020}} The legislation allowed the FCC to require license renewals of less than the legally required three years if the agency believes it would be in the public interest, prohibited gifts to FCC members, and declared illegal any contest or game with intent to deceive the audience.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> However, at the time, while the actions may have been disreputable, they were not illegal. As a result, no one went to prison for rigging game shows. The individuals who were prosecuted were charged because of attempts to cover up their actions, either by [[obstruction of justice]] or [[perjury]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n===Contestants===\nMany quiz show contestants' reputations were ruined, including:\n* [[Charles Van Doren]], who had become a regular on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]],'' lost his job in the television industry. He was also forced to resign his professorship at Columbia University. Van Doren took a job as an editor at ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'' earning about 20% of what he had been paid on ''Today'' and continued working as an editor and writer until his retirement in 1982.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} He refused requests for interviews for more than three decades and chose not to participate in the production of ''The Quiz Show Scandal,'' a 1992 one-hour documentary aired in the United States on [[PBS]]. He later turned down an offer of $100,000 to act as a consultant on the 1994 [[Robert Redford]]-directed feature film ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' after discussing the matter with his family members who, with the exception of his son John, were against his participation.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">Van Doren, Charles, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/28/080728fa_fact_vandoren \"All the Answers : The quiz-show scandals\u2014and the aftermath\"], The New Yorker, July 28, 2008</ref> In 2008, Van Doren broke his silence, describing his quiz show experience in an essay-length memoir published in ''[[The New Yorker]].''<ref name=\"newyorker.com\" /> Van Doren died on April 9, 2019.\n* [[Marie Winn]], whose notebook triggered ''Dotto''{{'}}s exposure and subsequent demise, eventually became a journalist whose books include ''[[The Plug-In Drug]],'' a scathing critique on television's influence over children.\n* Terry Nadler, whose $264,000 haul on ''The $64,000 Challenge'' stood as a record for two decades, resorted to applying for a temporary job with the [[United States Census Bureau]] when his prize money started running short; he was exposed as a likely fraud when he failed the civil service exam.<ref name=\"nadler\">{{cite web|title=Off the Map |date=March 28, 1960 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826147,00.html |accessdate=September 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200508/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C826147%2C00.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Hosts and producers===\nIn September 1958, a New York grand jury called producers who had coached contestants to appear in testimony. It was later estimated by a prosecutor on the case that of the 150 sworn witnesses before the panel, only 50 told the truth.<ref name=\"BoddyFiftiesTelevision\" /> Some producers included Barry, Enright and Frank Cooper. Barry and Enright's reputations suffered the most from the scandals as the result of the rigging of ''Twenty-One.'' Barry was effectively [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] from national television until 1969. Enright went to [[Canada]] to continue working in television and was unable to get another job in American television until 1975. Although he went through a difficult five-year period (according to an interview with ''[[TV Guide (magazine)|TV Guide]]'' before his death in 1984), Barry moved to [[Los Angeles]], eventually finding work on local television. He would later admit in an article in ''TV Guide'' that, in order to determine if he still had a bad reputation (because of the requirement to have a license with the FCC), he raised money to buy a [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] radio station, which is now [[KDAY]]. Barry returned to hosting with ''[[The Generation Gap]]'' in 1969 and had success with ''[[The Joker's Wild]],'' which premiered in 1972 and ended in 1975. Barry and Enright resumed their partnership full-time in 1976. Their production of game shows, notably the syndicated revivals of ''Tic-Tac-Dough'' (which Barry did not host) and ''Joker'' (which he did) in the late 1970s to mid-1980s, resulted in millions of dollars in revenue and, more importantly for both, forgiveness from the public for their involvement in the scandals. Indeed, Barry and Enright were able to sponsor the teen-sex comedy film ''[[Private Lessons (1981 film)|Private Lessons]],'' based on [[Dan Greenberg]]'s novel ''[[Philly (novel)|Philly]]'' and starring [[Eric Brown (actor)|Eric Brown]] alongside [[Sylvia Kristel]] and [[Howard Hesseman]], using revenue from their renewed success.\n\nOther producers met the same fate as Barry and Enright, but were unable to redeem themselves afterwards unlike those two. One of the more notable is Cooper, whose ''Dotto'' ended up being his longest-running and most popular game. Hosts such as [[Jack Narz]] and [[Hal March]] continued to work on television after the scandals. March died in January 1970 from lung cancer. Narz, who passed a lie-detector test at the time of the ''Dotto'' affair, had an extensive career as a game show host after the incident (as did his brother [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]]), retiring in 1982; he died in October 2008 after suffering two massive strokes. [[Sonny Fox]], the original host of ''The $64,000 Challenge,'' left long before it could become tainted and became a popular children's host in the northeast, remembered best as the suave, genial host of the Sunday morning learn-and-laugh marathon ''[[Wonderama]].'' Fox's replacement, [[Ralph Story]], went on to become a newscaster for KNXT-TV/[[KCBS-TV]] in Los Angeles.\n\n===Television===\nThe quiz show scandals exhibited the necessity for an even stronger network control over programming and production. Quiz show scandals also justified and accelerated the growth of the networks' power over television advertisers concerning licensing, scheduling and sponsorship of programs. The networks claimed to be ignorant and victims of the quiz show scandals. The NBC president at the time stated, \"NBC was just as much a victim of the quiz show frauds as was the public.\"<ref>Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics, William Boddy, University of Illinois Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-252-06299-5}}</ref> Quiz shows virtually disappeared from [[prime time]] American television for decades. Those that continued to air had substantially reduced prizes and many shows adopted limits on the number of games a player could win (usually five, the number of programs that could make up one broadcast week). ''Quiz'' shows became ''game'' shows, shifting focus from knowledge to puzzles and word games. NBC's comedy/game show ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]'' and ABC's more serious ''[[Make That Spare]]!'' were the only big-money game shows still on television after the fallout. Professional bowlers competed for prizes on these shows and the shows were typically considered sporting programs rather than game shows. Those shows continued to air into the early 1960s. The original version of ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and CBS's slate of low-budget [[panel game]]s were largely unaffected by the collapse; those shows would continue to air on network television into the mid-1960s, with ''The Price Is Right'' still offering lavish prizes throughout its prime time run.\n\nA quiz for big money would not return until [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] premiered ''[[100 Grand (game show)|100 Grand]]'' in 1963; it went off the air after three shows. It would not be until the late 1960s that five-figure prizes would again be offered on American television, and not until the late 1970s that six-figure prizes could be won; seven-figure prizes were sparingly awarded on ''[[The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime]]'' (which aired between 1986 and 1987), but would not be fully introduced until August 1999 when ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' premiered, setting off an era of million-dollar game shows including ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'' (which premiered in November 1999), ''[[The Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]'' (which premiered in April 2001) and ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'' (which premiered in December 2005 and became a regular series in March 2006).  Australia's short-lived ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australian game show)|Million Dollar Wheel of Fortune]]'' format was adopted to the U.S. version in 2008, and ''Millionaire'' ultimately ended its run in syndication in May 2019 after seventeen seasons.  ABC limited a contestant's winnings to $30,000 (although contestants were retired after winning $20,000) before permanently removing the limit in 1984. CBS initially limited a contestant's winnings to $25,000 beginning in 1972; contestants were allowed to keep up to $10,000 in excess of this limit, which would increase to $50,000 in 1984 (after [[Michael Larson]] won $110,237 on ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' by memorizing the game board's light patterns; contestants were now allowed to keep up to $25,000 above that limit and the next one), $75,000 in 1986 (which did not apply to the short-lived ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' in 1988 due to its maximum total winnings of $54,000) and $125,000 in 1990 (with no money being allowed above that limit) before being permanently eliminated by 2006, when contestants on the current incarnation of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' won over $140,000 in both the first and final episodes of the season during Bob Barker's final season; the show has since offered a high-stakes $100,000 pricing game, prizes over $100,000 during themed weeks (Big Money and Dream Car) and has also offered $1,000,000 in primetime specials. NBC never utilized a winnings limit on any of its game shows but kept cash and prizes within a reasonable range that created a ''de facto'' limit (for instance until its 1989 NBC cancellation, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' forced contestants to cash in their winnings per round on presented merchandise or apply it to a gift certificate or build their winnings for a later round at the risk of losing those winnings on penalties such as a \"Bankrupt\" spin). Some syndicated game shows also used a winnings limit: for example, contestants on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' were limited to $75,000 in regular play between the start of its current incarnation in 1984 to 1990 (with any excess winnings being donated to a charity of the contestant's choice); after Frank Spangenberg set the winnings record with $102,597, the cap was raised to $100,000, and later to $200,000 in 1997 (before being abolished in 2001 after the clue values were doubled). ''Jeopardy!'''s five-day champions limit was abolished in 2003, allowing for the show to create star contestants; since then, five contestants appeared on the show five or more consecutive weeks: [[Ken Jennings]] (15 weeks, 74 wins), [[James Holzhauer]] (6.2 weeks, 32 wins), [[Julia Collins (Jeopardy! contestant)|Julia Collins]] (4.2 weeks, 20 wins), [[David Madden (Jeopardy! contestant)|David Madden]] (4 weeks, 19 wins), and [[Jason Zuffranieri]] (4 weeks, 19 wins); [[Matt Jackson (Jeopardy! contestant)|Matt Jackson]] (13), [[Austin Rogers (Jeopardy! contestant)|Austin Rogers]] (12), [[List of Jeopardy! contestants#Seth Wilson|Seth Wilson]] (12), and [[Arthur Chu]] (11) were the other double-digit game winners on the show since the rule change.\n\nThe demise of the big-money quiz shows also gave rise to television's newest phenomenon: [[Western (genre)|western]]s. The disappearance of quiz shows, many of which were (apparent) demonstrations of highbrow intelligence and their replacement by dumbed-down game shows may have been one of many factors in the end of the [[Golden Age of Television]]; by 1960, numerous television critics were lamenting the rise of a [[Television and the Public Interest|vast wasteland]] of lowbrow television.\n\n==Rigging in other countries==\n===United Kingdom===\nIn 1958, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] pulled its version of ''Twenty-One'' almost immediately after contestant Stanley Armstrong claimed that he had been given \"definite leads\" to the answers. In 1960, this resulted in the [[Independent Television Authority]]'s placement of a permanent winnings cap for ITV game shows of \u00a31,000, which the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] increased to \u00a36,000 in 1981 (though the British version of ''[[The $64,000 Question (UK game show)|The $64,000 Question]]'' did receive special permission to offer \u00a36,400 when it premiered in 1990). The winnings cap was permanently eliminated by the IBA's successor organization, the [[Independent Television Commission]] in 1993. For many decades, British game shows earned a reputation for being cheap, low-budget affairs that focused more on entertainment than actual game play and prizes, in large part because of the restrictions put on game shows following the scandal. In addition to prize limits, games of chance were also largely forbidden, meaning that a number of American game shows could not be faithfully reproduced in the U.K. The lifting of these limits initially allowed more American shows to be adapted into British versions and within a few years, the rise of game shows with much higher prize limits \u2014 in particular ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' \u2014 would originate largely in the U.K. and make its way to both the R.T. and the U.S. in the late 1990s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quiz channel#2007 television phone-in scandals|2007 British television phone-in scandal]]\n* [[American game show winnings records]]\n* [[College Bowl]]\n* [[Martin Flood]]\n* [[Charles Ingram]]\n** ''[[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.]]''\n* [[Jay Jackson]]\n* [[Michael Larson]]\n* [[Quizbowl]]\n* ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''\n* ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|last = Sams|first = David R.|author2=Robert L.

The prizes of these new shows were unprecedented. ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'' became the first big-money [[television]] quiz show during the 1950s. In 1955, [[Joyce Brothers]] first earned fame by becoming the first woman to earn the $64,000 prize. It was revealed later that the show was \u201ccontrolled\u201d; the producers did not want her to win and deliberately gave her questions perceived to be beyond her ability, which she answered correctly anyway.

That initial broadcast was, in the words of co-producer [[Dan Enright]], \"a dismal failure\"; the first two contestants succeeded only in making a mockery of the format by showing how little they really knew by guessing many questions incorrectly. Show sponsor [[Geritol]], upon seeing this opening-night performance, reportedly became furious with the results, and said in no uncertain terms that they did not want to see a repeat performance.<ref name=\":0\"/> According to Enright in a 1992 PBS documentary, \"from that moment on, we decided to rig ''Twenty-One.''\" \n\nThree months into its run, ''Twenty-One'' featured a contestant, [[Herb Stempel]], who had been coached by producer [[Dan Enright]] to allow his opponent, [[Charles Van Doren]], to win the game. Stempel took the fall as requested. A year later, Stempel told the ''[[New York Journal-American]]''{{'}}s [[Jack O'Brian]] that his winning run as champion on the series had been choreographed to his advantage, and that the show's producer then ordered him to purposely lose his championship to Van Doren. With no proof, an article was never printed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/filmmore/transcript/|title=The American Experience {{!}} Quiz Show Scandal {{!}} Program Transcript|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nStempel's statements gained more credibility when [[match fixing]] in another game, ''[[Dotto]],'' was publicized in August 1958. Quiz show ratings across the networks plummeted and several were cancelled amid allegations of fixing.

As a result, many contestants' reputations were tarnished.\n\nIn 1960, the [[United States Congress]] amended the [[Communications Act of 1934]] to prohibit the fixing of quiz shows. As a result of that action, many networks canceled their existing quiz shows and replaced them with a higher number of [[public service]] programs.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Most networks also imposed a winnings and appearances limit on their existing and future game shows, which would eventually be removed by inflation and the rise of the million-dollar jackpot game shows starting in 1999.\n\n==Revelation==\nStempel was a contestant on ''Twenty-One'' who was coached by Enright. While Stempel was in the midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but ''Twenty-One'' did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner, Albert Freedman, were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Van Doren, who was an English teacher at [[Columbia University]] when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show ''[[Tic-Tac-Dough]].'' Enright, who produced both ''Tic-Tac-Dough'' and ''Twenty-One,'' saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren would be the perfect contestant to be the new face of ''Twenty-One.''<ref>Anderson, Kent. Television Fraud: The History and Implications of the Quiz Show Scandals. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood, 1978. Print.</ref> As part of their plan, the producers of ''Twenty-One'' arranged the first Van Doren-Stempel face-off to end in three ties. As prize money per-point in the margin of victory increased by $500 after each tie game, the next game would offer $2,000 for every point the winner led by; this was duly-noted in promotion of the following week's episode, which helped to attract significant viewership. After achieving winnings of $69,500, Stempel's scripted loss to the more popular Van Doren occurred on December 5, 1956. One of the questions Stempel answered incorrectly involved the winner of the [[27th Academy Awards|1955]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Motion Picture]] (the correct answer was ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]],'' one of Stempel's favorite movies; as instructed by Enright, Stempel gave the incorrect answer ''[[On the Waterfront]],'' winner of Best Motion Picture the [[26th Academy Awards|previous year]]).\n\nAlthough the manipulation of the contestants on ''Twenty-One'' helped the producers maintain viewer interest and ratings, the producers had not anticipated the extent of Stempel's resentment at being required to lose the contest against Van Doren.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Anderson, K.

Westport and London: Greenwood Press.</ref> After his preordained loss, Stempel spoke out against the operation, claiming that he deliberately lost the match against Van Doren on orders from Enright.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Initially, Stempel was dismissed as a sore loser, due in part to the fact that there was no solid reason to question the reputations of the quiz shows themselves. In August 1958, the abrupt cancellation of the quiz show ''Dotto'' bolstered his credibility when Edward Hilgemeier, Jr, a stand-by contestant three months earlier, sent an affidavit to the Federal Communications Commission claiming that while backstage, he had found a notebook containing the very answers contestant [[Marie Winn]] was delivering on stage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/154370718|title=28 Aug 1958, Page 6 - The News Journal at Newspapers.com|newspaper=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref> Although the reason for ''Dotto''<nowiki/>{{'}}s August cancellation was never given to the press, it was worked out in the days after that the reason was the implication that the game had been fixed. The story of fixing was widely known soon after. The American public's reactions were quick and powerful when the quiz show fraud became public: between 87% and 95% knew about the scandals as measured by industry-sponsored polls.<ref name=\"BoddyFiftiesTelevision\">Boddy, W.(1990). Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.</ref> Over the course of the second half of 1958, quiz shows implicated by the scandal were canceled rapidly. Among them, with their cancellation dates, were the following shows:\n* ''Dotto'' (August 16)\n* ''The $64,000 Challenge'' (September 14)\n* ''Twenty-One'' (October 16)\n* ''The $64,000 Question'' (November 9)\n* ''Tic-Tac-Dough,'' primetime edition (December 29)\nLate in August, New York prosecutor Joseph Stone convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate the allegations of the fixing of quiz shows. At the time of the empaneling, neither being a party to a fixed game show nor fixing a game show in the first place were crimes in their own right. Some witnesses in the grand jury acknowledged their role in a fixed show, while others denied it, directly contradicting one another. Many of the coached contestants, who had become celebrities due to their quiz show success, were so afraid of the social repercussions of admitting the fraud that they were unwilling to confess to having been coached, even to the point of perjuring themselves to avoid backlash. Show producers, who had legally rigged the games to increase ratings but did not want to implicate themselves, the show sponsors or the networks they worked for in doing so, categorically denied the allegations. After the nine-month grand jury, no indictments were handed down and the judge sealed the grand jury report in Summer 1959.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[86th United States Congress]], by then in its first session, soon responded; in October 1959, the [[House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight]], under Representative [[Oren Harris]]' chairmanship, began to hold hearings investigating the scandal. Stempel, Snodgrass and Hilgemeier all testified.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/investigationoft01unit|title=Investigation of television quiz shows.

The gravity of the scandal was confirmed on November 2, 1959 when Van Doren said to the Committee in a nationally televised session that, \"I was involved, deeply involved, in a deception. The fact that I, too, was very much deceived cannot keep me from being the principal victim of that deception, because I was its principal symbol.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/investigationoft02unit|title=Investigation of television quiz shows.

The Act and regulations written by the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) were indefinite in regards to fixed television programs. Due to the fact that there were no specific laws regarding the fraudulent behavior in the quiz shows, it is debatable whether the producers or contestants alike did anything illegal. Instead, it could be inferred that the medium was ill-used.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> After concluding the Harris Commission investigation, Congress amended the [[Communications Act of 1934|Communications Act]] to prohibit the fixing of of televised contests of intellectual knowledge or skill<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/509- 47 U.S.C. \u00a7509].</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last=Roth| first=Gary Franklin |date= September 1972 |title= The Quizzes and the Law: Fifteen Years after \u201cTwenty-One\u201d How Far Can They Go?| url= https://doi.org/10.1080/00315249.1972.9943360| journal= Performing Arts Review| volume=3| issue=4| pages=629\u2013654| doi= 10.1080/00315249.1972.9943360| issn=0031-5249}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, the bill that [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] signed into law on September 13, 1960, was a fairly mild improvement to the broadcast industry.{{according to whom|date=April 2020}} The legislation allowed the FCC to require license renewals of less than the legally required three years if the agency believes it would be in the public interest, prohibited gifts to FCC members, and declared illegal any contest or game with intent to deceive the audience.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> However, at the time, while the actions may have been disreputable, they were not illegal. As a result, no one went to prison for rigging game shows. The individuals who were prosecuted were charged because of attempts to cover up their actions, either by [[obstruction of justice]] or [[perjury]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n===Contestants===\nMany quiz show contestants' reputations were ruined, including:\n* [[Charles Van Doren]], who had become a regular on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]],'' lost his job in the television industry. He was also forced to resign his professorship at Columbia University. Van Doren took a job as an editor at ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'' earning about 20% of what he had been paid on ''Today'' and continued working as an editor and writer until his retirement in 1982.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} He refused requests for interviews for more than three decades and chose not to participate in the production of ''The Quiz Show Scandal,'' a 1992 one-hour documentary aired in the United States on [[PBS]]. He later turned down an offer of $100,000 to act as a consultant on the 1994 [[Robert Redford]]-directed feature film ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' after discussing the matter with his family members who, with the exception of his son John, were against his participation.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">Van Doren, Charles, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/28/080728fa_fact_vandoren \"All the Answers : The quiz-show scandals\u2014and the aftermath\"], The New Yorker, July 28, 2008</ref> In 2008, Van Doren broke his silence, describing his quiz show experience in an essay-length memoir published in ''[[The New Yorker]].''<ref name=\"newyorker.com\" /> Van Doren died on April 9, 2019.\n* [[Marie Winn]], whose notebook triggered ''Dotto''{{'}}s exposure and subsequent demise, eventually became a journalist whose books include ''[[The Plug-In Drug]],'' a scathing critique on television's influence over children.\n* Terry Nadler, whose $264,000 haul on ''The $64,000 Challenge'' stood as a record for two decades, resorted to applying for a temporary job with the [[United States Census Bureau]] when his prize money started running short; he was exposed as a likely fraud when he failed the civil service exam.<ref name=\"nadler\">{{cite web|title=Off the Map |date=March 28, 1960 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826147,00.html |accessdate=September 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200508/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C826147%2C00.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Hosts and producers===\nIn September 1958, a New York grand jury called producers who had coached contestants to appear in testimony. It was later estimated by a prosecutor on the case that of the 150 sworn witnesses before the panel, only 50 told the truth.<ref name=\"BoddyFiftiesTelevision\" /> Some producers included Barry, Enright and Frank Cooper. Barry and Enright's reputations suffered the most from the scandals as the result of the rigging of ''Twenty-One.'' Barry was effectively [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] from national television until 1969. Enright went to [[Canada]] to continue working in television and was unable to get another job in American television until 1975. Although he went through a difficult five-year period (according to an interview with ''[[TV Guide (magazine)|TV Guide]]'' before his death in 1984), Barry moved to [[Los Angeles]], eventually finding work on local television. He would later admit in an article in ''TV Guide'' that, in order to determine if he still had a bad reputation (because of the requirement to have a license with the FCC), he raised money to buy a [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] radio station, which is now [[KDAY]]. Barry returned to hosting with ''[[The Generation Gap]]'' in 1969 and had success with ''[[The Joker's Wild]],'' which premiered in 1972 and ended in 1975. Barry and Enright resumed their partnership full-time in 1976. Their production of game shows, notably the syndicated revivals of ''Tic-Tac-Dough'' (which Barry did not host) and ''Joker'' (which he did) in the late 1970s to mid-1980s, resulted in millions of dollars in revenue and, more importantly for both, forgiveness from the public for their involvement in the scandals. Indeed, Barry and Enright were able to sponsor the teen-sex comedy film ''[[Private Lessons (1981 film)|Private Lessons]],'' based on [[Dan Greenberg]]'s novel ''[[Philly (novel)|Philly]]'' and starring [[Eric Brown (actor)|Eric Brown]] alongside [[Sylvia Kristel]] and [[Howard Hesseman]], using revenue from their renewed success.\n\nOther producers met the same fate as Barry and Enright, but were unable to redeem themselves afterwards unlike those two. One of the more notable is Cooper, whose ''Dotto'' ended up being his longest-running and most popular game. Hosts such as [[Jack Narz]] and [[Hal March]] continued to work on television after the scandals. March died in January 1970 from lung cancer. Narz, who passed a lie-detector test at the time of the ''Dotto'' affair, had an extensive career as a game show host after the incident (as did his brother [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]]), retiring in 1982; he died in October 2008 after suffering two massive strokes. [[Sonny Fox]], the original host of ''The $64,000 Challenge,'' left long before it could become tainted and became a popular children's host in the northeast, remembered best as the suave, genial host of the Sunday morning learn-and-laugh marathon ''[[Wonderama]].'' Fox's replacement, [[Ralph Story]], went on to become a newscaster for KNXT-TV/[[KCBS-TV]] in Los Angeles.\n\n===Television===\nThe quiz show scandals exhibited the necessity for an even stronger network control over programming and production. Quiz show scandals also justified and accelerated the growth of the networks' power over television advertisers concerning licensing, scheduling and sponsorship of programs. The networks claimed to be ignorant and victims of the quiz show scandals. The NBC president at the time stated, \"NBC was just as much a victim of the quiz show frauds as was the public.\"<ref>Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics, William Boddy, University of Illinois Press, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-252-06299-5}}</ref> Quiz shows virtually disappeared from [[prime time]] American television for decades. Those that continued to air had substantially reduced prizes and many shows adopted limits on the number of games a player could win (usually five, the number of programs that could make up one broadcast week). ''Quiz'' shows became ''game'' shows, shifting focus from knowledge to puzzles and word games. NBC's comedy/game show ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]'' and ABC's more serious ''[[Make That Spare]]!'' were the only big-money game shows still on television after the fallout. Professional bowlers competed for prizes on these shows and the shows were typically considered sporting programs rather than game shows. Those shows continued to air into the early 1960s. The original version of ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and CBS's slate of low-budget [[panel game]]s were largely unaffected by the collapse; those shows would continue to air on network television into the mid-1960s, with ''The Price Is Right'' still offering lavish prizes throughout its prime time run.\n\nA quiz for big money would not return until [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] premiered ''[[100 Grand (game show)|100 Grand]]'' in 1963; it went off the air after three shows. It would not be until the late 1960s that five-figure prizes would again be offered on American television, and not until the late 1970s that six-figure prizes could be won; seven-figure prizes were sparingly awarded on ''[[The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime]]'' (which aired between 1986 and 1987), but would not be fully introduced until August 1999 when ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' premiered, setting off an era of million-dollar game shows including ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'' (which premiered in November 1999), ''[[The Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]'' (which premiered in April 2001) and ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'' (which premiered in December 2005 and became a regular series in March 2006).  Australia's short-lived ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australian game show)|Million Dollar Wheel of Fortune]]'' format was adopted to the U.S. version in 2008, and ''Millionaire'' ultimately ended its run in syndication in May 2019 after seventeen seasons.  ABC limited a contestant's winnings to $30,000 (although contestants were retired after winning $20,000) before permanently removing the limit in 1984. CBS initially limited a contestant's winnings to $25,000 beginning in 1972; contestants were allowed to keep up to $10,000 in excess of this limit, which would increase to $50,000 in 1984 (after [[Michael Larson]] won $110,237 on ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' by memorizing the game board's light patterns; contestants were now allowed to keep up to $25,000 above that limit and the next one), $75,000 in 1986 (which did not apply to the short-lived ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' in 1988 due to its maximum total winnings of $54,000) and $125,000 in 1990 (with no money being allowed above that limit) before being permanently eliminated by 2006, when contestants on the current incarnation of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' won over $140,000 in both the first and final episodes of the season during Bob Barker's final season; the show has since offered a high-stakes $100,000 pricing game, prizes over $100,000 during themed weeks (Big Money and Dream Car) and has also offered $1,000,000 in primetime specials. NBC never utilized a winnings limit on any of its game shows but kept cash and prizes within a reasonable range that created a ''de facto'' limit (for instance until its 1989 NBC cancellation, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' forced contestants to cash in their winnings per round on presented merchandise or apply it to a gift certificate or build their winnings for a later round at the risk of losing those winnings on penalties such as a \"Bankrupt\" spin). Some syndicated game shows also used a winnings limit: for example, contestants on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' were limited to $75,000 in regular play between the start of its current incarnation in 1984 to 1990 (with any excess winnings being donated to a charity of the contestant's choice); after Frank Spangenberg set the winnings record with $102,597, the cap was raised to $100,000, and later to $200,000 in 1997 (before being abolished in 2001 after the clue values were doubled). ''Jeopardy!'''s five-day champions limit was abolished in 2003, allowing for the show to create star contestants; since then, five contestants appeared on the show five or more consecutive weeks: [[Ken Jennings]] (15 weeks, 74 wins), [[James Holzhauer]] (6.2 weeks, 32 wins), [[Julia Collins (Jeopardy! contestant)|Julia Collins]] (4.2 weeks, 20 wins), [[David Madden (Jeopardy! contestant)|David Madden]] (4 weeks, 19 wins), and [[Jason Zuffranieri]] (4 weeks, 19 wins); [[Matt Jackson (Jeopardy! contestant)|Matt Jackson]] (13), [[Austin Rogers (Jeopardy! contestant)|Austin Rogers]] (12), [[List of Jeopardy! contestants#Seth Wilson|Seth Wilson]] (12), and [[Arthur Chu]] (11) were the other double-digit game winners on the show since the rule change.\n\nThe demise of the big-money quiz shows also gave rise to television's newest phenomenon: [[Western (genre)|western]]s. The disappearance of quiz shows, many of which were (apparent) demonstrations of highbrow intelligence and their replacement by dumbed-down game shows may have been one of many factors in the end of the [[Golden Age of Television]]; by 1960, numerous television critics were lamenting the rise of a [[Television and the Public Interest|vast wasteland]] of lowbrow television.\n\n==Rigging in other countries==\n===United Kingdom===\nIn 1958, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] pulled its version of ''Twenty-One'' almost immediately after contestant Stanley Armstrong claimed that he had been given \"definite leads\" to the answers. In 1960, this resulted in the [[Independent Television Authority]]'s placement of a permanent winnings cap for ITV game shows of \u00a31,000, which the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] increased to \u00a36,000 in 1981 (though the British version of ''[[The $64,000 Question (UK game show)|The $64,000 Question]]'' did receive special permission to offer \u00a36,400 when it premiered in 1990). The winnings cap was permanently eliminated by the IBA's successor organization, the [[Independent Television Commission]] in 1993. For many decades, British game shows earned a reputation for being cheap, low-budget affairs that focused more on entertainment than actual game play and prizes, in large part because of the restrictions put on game shows following the scandal. In addition to prize limits, games of chance were also largely forbidden, meaning that a number of American game shows could not be faithfully reproduced in the U.K. The lifting of these limits initially allowed more American shows to be adapted into British versions and within a few years, the rise of game shows with much higher prize limits \u2014 in particular ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' \u2014 would originate largely in the U.K. and make its way to both the R.T. and the U.S. in the late 1990s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quiz channel#2007 television phone-in scandals|2007 British television phone-in scandal]]\n* [[American game show winnings records]]\n* [[College Bowl]]\n* [[Martin Flood]]\n* [[Charles Ingram]]\n** ''[[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.]]''\n* [[Jay Jackson]]\n* [[Michael Larson]]\n* [[Quizbowl]]\n* ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''\n* ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|last = Sams|first = David R.|author2=Robert L.

{"title_page": "Participle", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of a verb which is used in a sentence to modify a noun or noun phrase}}\nA '''participle''' ('''{{sc|ptcp}}''') is a linguistics term for a certain class of [[nonfinite verb]] forms whose sentence function varies according to the contextual structure in which the participle occurs. Depending on the context, a participle may function  [[adverb]]ially or as an [[adjective]].<ref>[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAParticiple.htm What is a participle?] in [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Index.htm Glossary of linguistic terms] at SIL International.</ref>  Its name derives from the Latin ''participium'',<ref>{{L&S|participium|ref}}</ref> a [[calque]] of Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae (''metokh\u1e17'') \"partaking\" or \"sharing\";<ref>{{LSJ|metoxh/|\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae|ref}}</ref> because the [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] participles evince some analogous adverbial attributes and adjectival characteristics vis-\u00e0-vis nouns ([[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical case|case]]) as well as verbs ([[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[voice (grammar)|voice]]).\n\n== Forms ==\nLike other parts of the verb, participles can be either [[active voice|active]] (e.g. ''breaking'') or [[passive voice|passive]] (e.g. ''broken''). Participles are also often associated with certain verbal [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]s or tenses. The two types of participle in [[English verbs|English]] are traditionally called the '''present participle''' (forms such as ''writing'', ''singing'' and ''raising'') and the '''past participle''' (forms such as ''written'', ''sung'' and ''rungggggg'').\n\n== Usage ==\nParticiples can be used as an adjective:\n*A '''broken''' window. \n*A '''fallen''' tree. \n*An '''interesting''' book.\n\nAnother use is in a phrase which serves as a shortened form of a [[relative clause]]:\n*A window '''broken''' by the wind.\n*A woman '''wearing''' a red hat. \n\nThese phrases are equivalent to \n\n*A window that was '''broken''' by the wind.\n*A woman who was '''wearing''' a red hat.\n\nSuch participle phrases generally follow the noun they describe, just as relative clauses do.\n\nOften a participle replaces an [[adverbial clause]]. For example:\n*With '''drawn''' sword, he came to the '''sleeping''' [[Lucretia]].\n\nIn the above sentence, the participles can be interpreted as equivalent to an adverbial clause of time, namely \"after he had drawn his sword\", and \"when she was sleeping\".\n\nA [[verb phrase]] based on a participle is called a '''participle phrase''' or '''participial phrase''' (''participial'' is an adjective derived from ''participle''). For example, ''wearing a hat'' and ''broken by the wind'' are participial phrases based respectively on an English present participle and past participle. Since these phrases are equivalent to a [[clause]], they may also be called a '''participle clause''' or '''participial clause'''. Participial clauses generally do not have an expressed [[grammatical subject]]; but occasionally a participial clause does include a subject, as in the English [[nominative absolute]] construction ''The king having died, ...'' .\n\nA fourth use of participles in some languages is in combination with an auxiliary verb such as \"has\" or \"is\" to make a compound or [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb tense which in other languages can often be expressed by a single word:\n*He '''had drawn''' his sword (= Latin ''strinxerat''). She '''was sleeping''' (= Latin ''dormiebat'').\n\n== Types of participle ==\nParticiples are often connected to certain [[grammatical tense]]s or [[grammatical aspect]]s. The two types of participle in Modern English are termed '''present participle''' and '''past participle''', respectively. However, [[David Crystal|Crystal]] indicated that \"there is a tendency to avoid the traditional terms (and use terms like ''-ing form'' and ''-ed/-en form'' instead)\".<ref>Crystal, David. (2008). ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics'' (6th ed.), pp. 351-352. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.</ref> Other grammar books also noted that the terms do not imply that they are tensed forms.<ref>Huddleston, Rodney. (2002). In Rodney Huddleston & Geoffrey K. Pullum (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'' (pp. 78-81). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref> The traditional terms are misleading because the present participle is often associated with the progressive (continuous) aspect, while the past participle is linked with the perfect aspect or passive voice. See the examples below:\n\n*They were just standing there.<ref>Participles \u2013 Present, Past and Perfect. ''Lingolia''. Retrieved from https://english.lingolia.com/en/grammar/verbs/participles</ref>\n*By the time you get home I will have cleaned the house.<ref>Hewings, Martin. (2005). Future continuous and future perfect (continuous). In ''Advanced Grammar in Use'' (2nd ed.), p. 22. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nThe first sentence is in the past tense, but a present participle was used to express the progressive aspect. The second sentence is in the future tense, but a past participle was used for the perfect meaning.\n\nParticiples may also be identified with a particular [[grammatical voice|voice]]: [[active voice|active]] or [[passive voice|passive]]. Some languages (such as Latin and Russian) have distinct participles for active and passive uses. In English, the present participle is essentially an active participle, while the past participle has both active and passive uses.\n\nThe following examples illustrate this:\n* I saw John '''eating''' his dinner. (Here ''eating'' is an active present participle).\n* The bus has '''gone'''. (Here ''gone'' is an active past participle).\n* The window was '''broken''' with a rock. (Here ''broken'' is a passive past participle)\n\nA distinction is also sometimes made between '''adjectival participles''' and '''adverbial participles'''. An adverbial participle (or a participial phrase/clause based on such a participle) plays the role of an [[adverbial]] ([[adverb]] phrase) in the sentence in which it appears, whereas an adjectival participle (or a participial phrase/clause based on one) plays the role of an [[adjective phrase]]. Some languages have different forms for the two types of participle; such languages include [[Russian grammar|Russian]]<ref name=ruspar>[http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/particip.html The Russian Participles].

Details can be found in the sections below or in the articles on the grammars of specific languages.\n\nSome descriptive grammars treat adverbial and adjectival participles as distinct [[lexical category|lexical categories]], while others include them both in a single category of participles.<ref name=ruspar/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kiss |first=Katalin E. |last2=Kiefer |first2=Ferenc |last3=Sipt\u00e1r |first3=P\u00e9ter |title=\u00daj magyar nyelvtan |edition=3. kiad\u00e1s |series=Osiris tank\u00f6nyvek |year=2003 |publisher=Osiris Kiad\u00f3 |location=Budapest |language=Hungarian |issn=1218-9855}}</ref> Sometimes different names are used; adverbial participles in certain languages may be called [[converb]]s, [[gerund]]s, or [[gerundive]]s (though this is not consistent with the meanings of the terms ''gerund'' or ''gerundive'' as normally applied to English or Latin), or [[transgressive (linguistics)|transgressive]]s.\n\nParticiples can be used adjectivally (i.e. without characteristics of canonical verbs) as ''[[attributive adjective]]s''. They then take neither [[object (grammar)|object]] complements nor modifiers that are typical of canonical verbs, but adjectivally attributive participles are capable of being modified by adverbs such as ''very'' or ''slightly''. The difference is illustrated by the following examples:\n*The subject '''interesting''' him at the moment is Greek history.\n*Greek history is a very '''interesting''' subject.\n\nIn the first sentence ''interesting'' functions transitively as a nonfinite verb that takes the object ''him'', thereby forming the phrase ''interesting him'', which constitutes an adjectival phrase that modifies the noun, ''subject''. However, in the second sentence ''interesting'' functions non-transitively; it instead acts as a prepositive adjective that can be modified by typical adverbs such as ''very'' or ''quite'' (or a prefix such as ''un-''). Similar examples are \"''interested'' people\", \"a ''frightened'' rabbit\", \"''fallen'' leaves\", \"''meat-eating'' animals\".\n\n==Indo-European languages==\n\n===Germanic languages===\n\n====Early English====\nIn [[Old English]], past participles of [[Germanic strong verb]]s were marked with a ''ge-'' prefix, as are most strong and weak past participles in Dutch and German today, and often by a vowel change in the stem. Those of weak verbs were marked by the ending ''-d'', with or without an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel before it. Modern English past participles derive from these forms (although the ''ge-'' prefix, which became ''y-'' in Middle English, has now been lost \u2014 except in some rare dialects such as the [[Dorset dialect]], where it takes the form of ''a-'').\n\nOld English present participles were marked with an ending in ''-ende'' (or ''-iende'' for verbs whose infinitives ended in ''-ian'').\n\n====Middle English====\nIn [[Middle English]], the form of the present participle varied across regions: ''-ende'' (southwest, southeast, [[English Midlands|Midlands]]), ''-inde'' (southwest, southeast), ''-and'' (north), ''-inge'' (southeast). The last is the one that became standard, falling together with the suffix ''-ing'' used to form [[verbal noun]]s. See [[-ing#Etymology|''-ing'' (etymology)]].\n\n====Modern English====\n{{anchor|Modern English}}\n[[Modern English]] verbs have two participles:<ref>Quirk et al., 3.9</ref>\n* The ''present participle'', also sometimes called the ''[[active voice|active]]'', ''[[imperfect]]'', or ''[[progressive aspect|progressive]]'' participle, takes the ending ''-ing'', for example ''doing'', ''seeing'', ''working'', ''running''. It is identical in form to the [[verbal noun]] and [[gerund]] (see below). The term ''present participle'' is sometimes used to include the gerund;<ref>For example, Quirk et al., 4.12.</ref> and the term \"gerund\u2013participle\" is also used.\n* The ''past participle'', also sometimes called the ''[[passive voice|passive]]'' or ''[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]'' participle, is identical to the [[simple past|past tense]] form (ending in ''-ed'') in the case of regular verbs, for example \"loaded\", \"boiled\", \"mounted\", but takes various forms in the case of [[English irregular verbs|irregular verbs]], such as ''done'', ''sung'', ''written'', ''put'', ''gone'', etc.\n\nIn addition various compound participles can be formed, such as ''having done'', ''being done'', ''having been doing'', ''having been done''.<ref>Quirk et al., 3.15.</ref>\n\nDetails of participle formation can be found under [[English verbs]] and [[List of English irregular verbs]].\n\nThe present participle, or participial phrases (clauses) formed from it, are used as follows:\n*to form the [[progressive aspect|progressive]] (continuous) aspect: ''Jim was '''sleeping'''.''\n*as an adjectival phrase that can modify a subject or object: ''The man '''standing''' over there is my uncle;'' ''We are a people '''clamoring''' for freedom''.\n*adverbially, the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] being understood to be the same as that of the main clause: '''''Looking''' at the plans, I gradually came to see where the problem lay.'' ''He shot the man, '''killing''' him.''\n*similarly, but with a different subject, placed before the participle (the [[nominative absolute]] construction): ''He and I '''having''' reconciled our differences, the project then proceeded smoothly.''\n*more generally as a clause or sentence modifier: ''Broadly '''speaking''', the project was successful.'' (See also [[dangling participle]].)\n\nPast participles, or participial phrases (clauses) formed from them, are used as follows:\n*to form the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspect: ''The chicken has '''eaten'''.''\n*to form the [[English passive voice|passive voice]]: ''The chicken was '''eaten'''.''\n*as an adjectival phrase: ''The chicken '''eaten''' by the children was contaminated.'' (See also [[reduced relative clause]].)\n*adverbially: '''''Eaten''' in this manner, the chicken presents no problem.''\n*in a nominative absolute construction, with a subject: ''The chicken '''eaten''', we returned home.''\n\nBoth types of participles are also often used adjectivally (see {{slink||Types of participle}} above). For instance:\n*\"An ''exciting'' adventure\" (i.e. one that excites) demonstrates a present participle that is used in an attributive sense.\n*\"The ''attached'' files\" (i.e. those that are attached) and \"Our ''fallen'' comrades\" (i.e. those who have fallen) demonstrate past participles that are used in an attributive sense.\nNote, however, that a past participle that complements a [[stative verb]] (e.g., \"The files that ''are attached'' or \"Our comrades who ''have fallen'') becomes a passive participle within a [[passive voice]] construct. Additionally, participles that express an adjectivally attributive meaning can be affixed to form adverbs, such as ''interestingly'' and ''excitedly''.\n\nThe [[gerund]] is distinct from the present participle. A gerund can function transitively (e.g., \"I like ''eating ice cream'') or intransitively (e.g., \"I like ''swimming''). In both instances, a gerund functions nominatively rather than adjectivally or adverbially whether as an object (e.g., \"I like ''sleeping''\") or as a subject (e.g., \"''Sleeping'' is not allowed.\") Although ''gerunds'' and ''present participles'' are morphologically identical, their grammatical functions differ substantially. Sometimes their morphological similarity can create contextual ambiguity, as [[Noam Chomsky]] pointed out in his well-known example:<ref>Noam Chomsky, ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,\n1965), 21.</ref>\n*'''''Flying''' planes can be dangerous.''\n\nWhen the meaning is \"The practice of flying a plane is dangerous,\" ''flying'' functions as a gerund; when the meaning is \"Planes that fly\" or \"Planes when they are flying\" (i.e., in contrast to ''grounded planes''), ''flying'' is being used adjectivally as a participle.\n\nFor more on the distinctions between these uses of the ''-ing'' verb form, see [[-ing#Uses|''-ing'': uses]].\n\nFor more details on uses of participles and other parts of verbs in English, see [[Uses of English verb forms]], including the sections on the [[Uses of English verb forms#Present participle|present participle]] and [[Uses of English verb forms#Past participle|past participle]].\n\n==== Scandinavian languages ====\nIn all of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] the past participle has to agree with the noun to some degree. All of the Scandinavian languages have mandatory agreement with the noun in number. [[Nynorsk]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] have mandatory agreement in both number and gender. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] have agreement in number, gender and case. For the present participle there is no agreement.\n\nExamples in [[Nynorsk]]:\n* '''Sj\u00f8lvk\u00f8yrande''' bilar kan vere farlege. (English: '''self-driving''' ''cars can be dangerous)''\n* Kyllingen vart '''eten''' (English: The chicken was '''eaten''')\n* Dyret vart '''ete''' (English: The animal was '''eaten''')\nThe participles are marked in bold. The first example involves a present participle and the two latter examples involves a past participle. All present participles end with an -ande suffix.\n\n===Latin and Romance languages===\n\n====Latin====\n{{main article|Latin syntax#Participles|Latin conjugation#Participles|Latin syntax#The gerundive}}\n\n[[Latin]] grammar was studied in Europe for hundreds of years, especially the handbook written by the 4th-century teacher [[Aelius Donatus]], and it is from Latin that the name and concept of the participle derives. According to Donatus there are four participles in Latin, as follows:<ref>Donatus, ''Ars Minor: de participio''.</ref>\n\n* '''present''' participle: present stem + ''-ns'' (gen. ''-ntis''); e.g. ''leg\u0113ns'' (plural ''legent\u0113s'')  \"(while) reading\"\n* '''perfect''' participle: [[Latin conjugation#Supine|supine]] stem + ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um''; e.g. ''l\u0113ctus'' \"read (by someone)\"\n* '''future''' participle: supine stem + ''-\u016brus'', ''-\u016bra'', ''-\u016brum''; e.g. ''l\u0113ct\u016brus''  \"going to read\", \"due to read\"\n* '''gerundive''' (sometimes<ref>cf. Wheelock, pp. 106ff and 112 note; Allen & Greenough, p. 315.</ref> considered the future passive participle): e.g. ''legendus'' \"due to be read\", \"necessary to be read\"\n\nHowever, many modern Latin grammars treat the gerundive as a separate part of speech.<ref>e.g. Kennedy, Gildersleeve & Lodge, etc.</ref>\n\nThe perfect participle is usually [[Passive voice|passive]] in meaning, and thus mainly formed from [[Transitive verb|transitive]] verbs, for example ''fr\u0101ctus'' \"broken\", ''missus'' \"sent (by someone)\". However, certain verbs (called [[deponent verb]]s) have a perfect participle in an [[Active verb|active]] sense, e.g. ''profectus'' \"having set out\", ''hort\u0101tus'' \"having encouraged\", etc. The present and future participles are always active, the gerundive usually passive.\n\nBecause a participle is an adjective as well as a verb, just like any other Latin adjective its ending changes according to the noun it describes. So when the noun is masculine, the participle must be masculine; when the noun is in the [[accusative case|accusative]] (object) case, the participle is also in the accusative case; when the noun has plural endings, the participle also has plural endings. Thus a simple participle such as ''fr\u0101ctus'' \"broken\" can change to ''fr\u0101cta'', ''fr\u0101ctum'', ''fr\u0101ct\u012b'', ''fr\u0101ct\u014d'' and so on, according to its gender, number, and case.\n\nA participle can have a descriptive meaning like an adjective, or a more dynamic meaning like a verb. Thus in the following sentence the participle ''str\u012bct\u014d'' \"drawn\" is better taken as describing an action (\"he drew his sword\" or \"after drawing his sword\") rather than as describing the sword (\"with a drawn sword\"):\n\n*'''''Str\u012bct\u014d''' gladi\u014d ad '''dormientem''' Lucr\u0113tiam v\u0113nit.''<ref>Livy, 1.58.2</ref><br />\"With '''drawn''' sword he came to the '''sleeping''' Lucretia.\"\n\nThe dynamic, verbal meaning is more common, and Latin often uses a participle where English might use a simple verb.\n\nThe present participle often describes the circumstances attending the main verb. A typical example is:\n*''Balbus ad m\u0113 v\u0113nit '''curr\u0113ns'''''.<ref>Cicero, ''ad Atticum'' 9.2a.3.</ref><br />\"Balbus came to me '''running'''.\"\n\nBoth the future and the perfect participle (but not the present participle) can be used with various tenses of the verb ''esse'' \"to be\" to make a compound tense such as the future-in-the-past or the perfect passive:\n*''E\u014d di\u0113 R\u014dmam '''vent\u016brus erat'''.''<ref>Cicero, ''pro Milone'' 28.</ref><br />\"On that day '''he was going to return''' to Rome.\"\n*'''''Occ\u012bsus est''' \u0101 Th\u0113b\u0101n\u012bs.''<ref>Nepos, ''Lysander'' 3.4.</ref><br />\"'''He was killed''' by the Thebans.\"\n\nThe perfect and future participles can also be used, with or without the verb ''esse'' \"to be\", in indirect speech clauses:\n*''(D\u012bxit e\u014ds) locum facile '''invent\u016br\u014ds''' (esse).''<ref>Nepos, ''Hannibal'' 12.3.</ref><br />\"He said that they were easily '''going to find''' the place / He said that they '''would find''' the place easily.\"\n\nFor uses of the gerundive, see [[Latin syntax#The gerundive]].\n\n====French====\nThere are two basic participles:\n*'''Present active participle''': formed by dropping the ''-ons'' of the ''nous'' form of the present tense of a verb (except with ''\u00eatre'' and ''avoir'') and then adding ''ant'': ''marchant'' \"walking\", ''\u00e9tant'' \"being\", ''ayant'' \"having\".\n*'''Past participle''': formation varies according to verb group: ''vendu'' \"sold\", ''mis'' \"placed\", ''march\u00e9'' \"walked\", ''\u00e9t\u00e9'' \"been\", and ''fait'' \"done\". The sense of the past participle is passive as an adjective and in most verbal constructions with \"avoir\", but active in verbal constructions with \"\u00eatre\", in reflexive constructions, and with some intransitive verbs.<ref>Maurice Grevisse, ''[[Le Bon Usage]]'', 10th edition, \u00a7 776.</ref>\n\nCompound participles are possible:\n*'''Present perfect participle''': ''ayant appel\u00e9'' \"having called\", ''\u00e9tant mort'' \"being dead\"\n*'''Passive perfect participle''': ''\u00e9tant vendu'' \"being sold, having been sold\"\n\nUsage:\n*'''Present participles''' are used as qualifiers as in \"un insecte '''volant'''\" (a flying insect) and in some other contexts. They are never used to form tenses. The present participle is used in subordinate clauses, usually with ''en'': \"Je marche, en parlant\".\n*'''Past participles''' are used as qualifiers for nouns: \"la table '''cass\u00e9e'''\" (the broken table); to form compound tenses such as the perfect \"Vous avez '''dit'''\" (you have said) and to form the passive voice: \"il a \u00e9t\u00e9 '''tu\u00e9'''\" (he/it has been killed).\n\n====Spanish====\nIn Spanish, the so-called present or active participle (''participio activo'' or ''participio de presente'') of a verb is traditionally formed with one of the suffixes ''-ante, -ente'' or ''-iente'', but modern grammar does not consider it a true participle, as such forms usually have the meaning of simple adjectives or nouns: e.g. ''amante'' \"loving\" or \"lover\", ''viviente'' \"living\" or \"live\".\n\nAnother participial form is known as the ''gerundio'', which ends in an (unchanging) suffix ''-ando'', ''-endo'', or ''-iendo''. The gerundio is used in combination with the verb ''estar'' (\"to be\") to make continuous tenses: for example, ''estar haciendo'' means \"to be doing\" (''haciendo'' being the ''gerundio'' of ''hacer'', \"to do\"), and there are related constructions such as ''seguir haciendo'' meaning \"to keep doing\" (''seguir'' being \"to continue\"). Another use is in phrases such as ''vino corriendo'' (\"he/she came running\") and ''lo vi corriendo'' (\"I saw him running\").\n\nThe past participle (''participio pasado'' or ''participio pasivo'') is regularly formed with one of the suffixes ''-ado'' or ''-ido''; but some verbs have an irregular form ending in ''-to'' (e.g. ''escrito, visto, puesto''), or ''-cho'' (e.g. ''dicho, hecho''). The past participle is used generally as an adjective referring to a finished action, in which case its ending changes according to gender and number. At other times is used to form compound tenses (as in English), in which case it is indeclinable. Some examples:\n\nAs an adjective:\n*''las cartas escritas'' \"the written letters\"\n\nTo form compound tenses:\n*''Ha escrito una carta.'' \"She (he, it) has written a letter.\"\n\n===Hellenic languages===\n\n====Ancient Greek====\n{{Main article|Participle (Ancient Greek)}}\nThe [[Ancient Greek]] participle shares in the properties of adjectives and verbs. Like an adjective, it changes form for [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical case|case]], and [[grammatical number|number]]. Like a verb, it has [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[voice (grammar)|voice]], is modified by [[adverb]]s, and can take [[verb argument]]s, including an [[object (grammar)|object]].<ref>{{Smyth|2039}}</ref> Participles are quite numerous in Ancient Greek: a non-defective verb has as many as ten participles.\n\nThere is a form of the participle for every combination of tense (present, aorist, perfect, future) and voice (active, middle, passive).

There is no [[consonant mutation|mutation]] in either case. In the passive voice, participles are usually replaced by a compound phrase such as ''wedi cael ei/eu'' (\"having got his/her/their ...ing\") in contemporary Welsh and by the impersonal form in classical Welsh.\n\n===Slavic languages===\n\n====Polish====\nThe Polish word for participle is ''imies\u0142\u00f3w'' ([[plural|pl.]]: ''imies\u0142owy''). There are four types of ''imies\u0142owy'' in two classes:\n\nAdjectival participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przymiotnikowy''):\n* active adjectival participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przymiotnikowy czynny''): ''robi\u0105cy'' \u2013 \"doing\", \"one who does\"\n* passive adjectival participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przymiotnikowy bierny''): ''robiony'' \u2013 \"being done\" (can only be formed off [[transitive verb]]s)\n\nAdverbial participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przys\u0142\u00f3wkowy''):\n* present adverbial participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przys\u0142\u00f3wkowy wsp\u00f3\u0142czesny''): robi\u0105c \u2013 \"doing\", \"while doing\"\n* perfect adverbial participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przys\u0142\u00f3wkowy uprzedni''): ''zrobiwszy'' \u2013 \"having done\" (formed in virtually all cases off verbs in their [[perfective aspect|perfective forms]], here denoted by the [[prefix]] ''z-'')\n\nDue to the distinction between adjectival and adverbial participles, in Polish it is practically impossible to make a [[dangling modifier|dangling participle]] in the classical English meaning of the term. For instance, in the sentence:\n\n*I found them hiding in the closet.\n\nit is unclear whether \"I\" or \"they\" were hiding in the closet. In Polish there is a clear distinction:\n\n* ''Znalaz\u0142em ich, chowaj\u0105c si\u0119 w szafie.'' \u2013 ''chowaj\u0105c'' is a present adverbial participle agreeing grammatically with the subject (\"I\")\n* ''Znalaz\u0142em ich chowaj\u0105cych si\u0119 w szafie.'' \u2013 ''chowaj\u0105cych'' is an active adjectival participle agreeing grammatically with the object (\"them\")\n\n====Russian====\nVerb: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250t\u02b2] (to hear, [[imperfective aspect]])\n\n*Present active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250.\u0255\u02d0\u026aj] \"hearing\", \"who hears\" \n*Present passive: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0268\u031e.m\u0268\u031ej] \"being heard\", \"that is heard\", \"audible\" \n*Past active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f.\u0282\u0268\u031ej] \"who heard\", \"who was hearing\" \n*Past passive: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250n.n\u0268\u031ej] \"that was heard\", \"that was being heard\" \n*[[adverbial participle|Adverbial]] present active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250] \"(while) hearing\" \n*Adverbial past active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f] \" (while) hearing \"\n\nVerb: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250t\u02b2] (to hear, [[perfective aspect]])\n\n*Past active: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f.\u0282\u0268\u031ej] \"who has heard\"\n*Past passive: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250n.n\u0268\u031ej] \"who has been heard\"\n*Adverbial past active: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432 [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f] \"having heard\"\n\nFuture participles formed from perfective verbs are not considered a part of standard language.<ref>[https://helsinki.academia.edu/KseniaShagal/Papers/1572263/Future_participles_in_Russian_Expanding_the_participial_paradigm Shagal (Krapivina), Future participles in Russian: Expanding the participial paradigm]</ref>\n\n====Bulgarian====\nParticiples are adjectives formed from verbs.

The following points may be noted:<ref>[http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3 Macedonian Grammar], [[Victor Friedman]]</ref>\n* present active participle: this has transformed into a verbal adverb;\n* present passive participle: there are some isolated cases or remnants of the present passive participle, such as the word \u043b\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c [lakom] (greedy);\n* past active participle: there is only one remnant of the past active participle, which is the word \u0431\u0438\u0432\u0448 [biv\u0161] (former). However, this word is often replaced with the word \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d [porane\u0161en] (former);\n* past passive participle: this has been transformed into a verbal adjective (it behaves like a normal adjective);\n* resultative participle: this has transformed into a verbal l-form (\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043b-\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430). It is not a participle since it doesn't function attributively.\n\n===Baltic languages===\n\n====Lithuanian====\nAmong Indo-European languages, the [[Lithuanian language]] is unique for having fourteen different participial forms of the verb, which can be grouped into five when accounting for inflection by tense. Some of these are also inflected by gender and case. For example, the verb ''eiti'' (\"to go, to walk\") has the active participle forms ''ein\u0105s/einantis'' (\"going, walking\", present tense), ''\u0117j\u0119s'' (past tense), ''eisi\u0105s'' (future tense), ''eidav\u0119s'' (past frequentative tense), the passive participle forms ''einamas'' (\"being walked\", present tense), ''eitas'' (\u201cwalked\u201d past tense), ''eisimas'' (future tense), the adverbial participles ''einant'' (\"while [he, different subject] is walking\" present tense), ''\u0117jus'' (past tense), ''eisiant'' (future tense), ''eidavus'' (past frequentative tense), the semi-participle ''eidamas'' (\"while [he, the same subject] is going, walking\") and the participle of necessity ''eitinas'' (\"that which needs to be walked\"). The active, passive, and the semi-participles are inflected by gender, and the active, passive, and necessity ones are inflected by case.\n\n==Semitic languages==\n\n===Arabic===\n{{Main article|Arabic verbs#Participle|l1=Arabic verbs: Participle}}\nThe [[Arabic grammar#Verbs|Arabic verb]] has two participles: an active participle (\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644) and a passive participle (\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0639\u0648\u0644 ), and the form of the participle is predictable by inspection of the dictionary form of the verb. These participles are inflected for gender, number and case, but not person. Arabic participles are employed syntactically in a variety of ways: as nouns, as adjectives or even as verbs. Their uses vary across [[varieties of Arabic]]. In general the active participle describes a property of the syntactic subject of the verb from which it derives, whilst the passive participles describes the object. For example, from the verb \u0643\u062a\u0628 ''kataba'', the active participle is ''k\u0101tib'' \u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 and the passive participle is ''makt\u016bb'' \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628. Roughly these translate to \"writing\" and \"written\" respectively. However, they have different, derived lexical uses. \u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 ''k\u0101tib'' is further lexicalized as \"writer\", \"author\" and \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 ''makt\u016bb'' as \"letter\".\n\nIn [[Classical Arabic]] these participles do not participate in verbal constructions with auxiliaries the same way as their English counterparts do, and rarely take on a verbal meaning in a sentence (a notable exception being participles derived from [[Verb framing|motion verbs]] as well as participles in [[Qur'anic Arabic]]).  In certain [[dialects of Arabic]] however, it is much more common for the participles, especially the active participle, to have verbal force in the sentence. For example, in dialects of the [[Levant]], the active participle is a structure that describes the state of the syntactic subject after the action of the verb from which it derives has taken place. ''\u02bc\u0100kil'', the active participle of ''\u02bcakala'' (\"to eat\"), describes one's state after having eaten something.  Therefore, it can be used in analogous way to the English [[present perfect]] (for example, ''\u02bcAn\u0101 \u02bc\u0101kil'' \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0622\u0643\u0644 meaning \"I have eaten\", \"I have just eaten\" or \"I have already eaten\"). Other verbs, such as ''r\u0101\u1e25a'' \u0631\u0627\u062d (\"to go\") give a participle (''r\u0101yi\u1e25'' \u0631\u0627\u064a\u062d), which has a progressive (\"is going...\") meaning. The exact tense or continuity of these participles is therefore determined by the nature of the specific verb (especially its [[lexical aspect]] and its [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]]) and the syntactic/semantic context of the utterance. What ties them all together is that they describe the subject of the verb from which they derive. The passive participles in certain dialects can be used as a sort of [[passive voice]], but more often than not, are used in their various lexicalized senses as adjectives or nouns.\n\n==Finno-Ugric languages==\n\n===Finnish===\nFinnish uses six participles to convey different meanings. Below is a table displaying the declension of the participles of the verb '''tappaa''' (to kill).\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Finnish Participles\n!\n! Active\n! Passive\n|-\n! Present\n| tappava || tapettava\n|-\n! Past\n| tappanut\n| tapettu\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Agent\n| tappama-\n|-\n! Negative\n| tappamaton\n|}\n\nThe participles work in the following way:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|tappava\n| '''Present active participle:''' Conveys an ongoing action. Used to omit the use of the relative pronoun ''who'', ''which'' or ''that''. Tappava means \"killing\" as in \"killing machine\". In other words, machine ''that'' kills. It can also work as the subject of the sentence. In other words, tappava can mean \"the one who kills\" or \"he who kills\". Tappava on... = He who kills is...\n|-\n|tapettava\n| '''Present passive participle:''' Conveys possibility and obligation. Possibility as in -able (killable) and obligation as in ''something that has to be killed''. ''Tapettava mies'' can mean both \"the killable man\" (possibility) and \"the man who has to be killed\" (obligation).\n|-\n|tappanut\n| '''Past active participle:''' Used with the verb ''olla'' (to be) to construct the perfect and the past perfect tenses. In English the verb \"to have\" is used to form the perfect and past perfect tense (I '''have'''/'''had''' killed), in Finnish the verb \"to be\" is used instead (min\u00e4 '''olen'''/'''olin''' tappanut). Just like the present active participle, it can also be used as the subject in a sentence, except it conveys the meaning in the past tense. In other words, tappanut can mean \"the one who killed\" or \"he who killed\". Tappanut on... = He who killed is...\n|-\n|tapettu\n| '''Past passive participle:''' A concluded action. Tapettu mies = the killed man.\n|-\n|tappama-\n| '''Agent participle:''' Always used with a possessive suffix. It is used to convey the meaning of the word \"by\" in English, since there is no word for \"by\" in Finnish. H\u00e4nen tappa'''mansa''' mies = The man killed '''by him'''. The tense of the translation depends on the context.\n|-\n|tappamaton\n| '''Negative participle:''' Used to convey impossibility (unkillable) and undoneness (not killed). Tappamaton mies means both \"unkillable man\" and \"man (who is) not killed\".\n|}\n\nEach and every one of these participles can be used as adjectives, which means that some of them can be turned into nouns.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Finnish (adjective)\n| tappava || tapettava || tappamaton\n|-\n! English (adjective)\n| killing || killable || unkillable (possibility) or ''not killed'' (undoneness)\n|-\n!

Some participles may be conjugated, but some may not. Participles always precede the noun they are defining, as in English.\n\nParticiple suffixes, like many other suffixes in Turkish, change according to the [[vowel harmony]] and [[sandhi]].\n\nThere are eight types of participle suffixes; ''-en'', ''-esi'', ''-mez'', ''-ar'', ''-di(k/\u011fi)'' ''-ecek'' and ''-mi\u015f'' <ref>Ergin 310</ref><ref name=\"y\u0131ld\u0131z\">[http://www.sosbil.aku.edu.tr/dergi/II2/11-Gurer-gulsevin.pdf  D\u00e2sit\u00e2n-\u0131 Sult\u00e2n Mahm\u00fbd Mesnevisi'nde Fiiller, S\u00fcleyman Demirel \u00dcniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi], Osman Y\u0131ld\u0131z, May 2007 (PDF)</ref>\n\n==Austronesian languages==\n\n===Malay and Indonesian===\n{{Main|Malay grammar}}\n\n[[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] use prefixes such as ''di-'' (intentional), ''ter-'' (accidental) or ''sudah''.\n\n==Eskimo-Aleut languages==\n\n===Sireniki Eskimo===\n[[Sireniki Eskimo language]], an extinct [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut language]], has separate sets of ''adverbial participles'' and ''adjectival participles''. Different from in English, adverbial participles are conjugated to reflect the person and number of their implicit subjects; hence, while in English a sentence like \"If ''I'' were a marksman, ''I'' would kill walruses\" requires two full clauses (to distinguish the two verbs' different subjects), in Sireniki Eskimo one of these may be replaced with an adverbial participle (since its conjugation indicates the subject).\n\n==Constructed languages==\n\n===Esperanto===\n{{Main article|Esperanto grammar#Participles|l1=Esperanto grammar: Participles}}\n\n[[Esperanto]] has six different participle conjugations; active and passive for past, present and future. The participles are formed as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Past\n! Present\n! Future\n|-\n| '''Active'''\n| -inta\n| -anta\n| -onta\n|-\n| '''Passive'''\n| -ita\n| -ata\n| -ota\n|}\nFor example, a ''falonta botelo'' is a bottle that will fall or is about to fall. A ''falanta botelo'' is one that is falling through the air. After it hits the floor, it is a ''falinta botelo.'' These examples use the active participles, but the usage of the passive participles is similar. A cake that is going to be divided is a ''dividota kuko''. When it is in the process of being divided, it is a ''dividata kuko''. Having been cut, it is now a ''dividita kuko''.\n\nThese participles can be used in conjunction with the verb to be, ''esti'', forming 18 compound tenses (9 active and 9 passive). However, this soon becomes complicated and often unnecessary, and is only frequently used when rigorous translation of English is required. An example of this would be ''la knabo estos instruita'', or, the boy will have been taught. This example sentence is then in the future anterior.\n\nWhen the suffix ''-o'' is used, instead of ''-a'', then the participle refers to a person. A ''man\u011danto'' is someone who is eating. A ''man\u011dinto'' is someone who ate. A ''man\u011donto'' is someone who will eat. Also, a ''man\u011dito'' is someone who was eaten, a ''man\u011dato'' is someone who is being eaten, and a ''man\u011doto'' is someone who will be eaten.\n\nThese rules hold true for all transitive verbs. Since copular and intransitive verbs do not have passive voice, their participle forms can only be active.\n\nAn informal and unofficial addition to these six are the participles for conditional forms, which use ''-unt-'' and ''-ut-''.  For example, ''parolunto'' refers to someone who would speak (or would have spoken), and a ''leguta libro'' is a book that would be read (or have been read). These unofficial participle forms are however very rarely used in practice, and more often as a linguistic joke than in a serious way.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attributive verb]]\n*[[Gerund]]\n*[[Grammar]]\n*[[Hanging participle]]\n*[[Nonfinite verb]]\n*[[Transgressive (linguistics)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/047.html Participles] from the ''American Heritage Book of English Usage'' (1996).\n*Quirk, R; Greenbaum, S; Leech, G.; Svartvik, J.

Depending on the context, a participle may function  [[adverb]]ially or as an [[adjective]].<ref>[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAParticiple.htm What is a participle?] in [http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Index.htm Glossary of linguistic terms] at SIL International.</ref>  Its name derives from the Latin ''participium'',<ref>{{L&S|participium|ref}}</ref> a [[calque]] of Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae (''metokh\u1e17'') \"partaking\" or \"sharing\";<ref>{{LSJ|metoxh/|\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae|ref}}</ref> because the [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] participles evince some analogous adverbial attributes and adjectival characteristics vis-\u00e0-vis nouns ([[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical case|case]]) as well as verbs ([[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[voice (grammar)|voice]]).\n\n== Forms ==\nLike other parts of the verb, participles can be either [[active voice|active]] (e.g. ''breaking'') or [[passive voice|passive]] (e.g. ''broken''). Participles are also often associated with certain verbal [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]s or tenses. The two types of participle in [[English verbs|English]] are traditionally called the '''present participle''' (forms such as ''writing'', ''singing'' and ''raising'') and the '''past participle''' (forms such as ''written'', ''sung'' and ''raised'').\n\n== Usage ==\nParticiples can be used as an adjective:\n*A '''broken''' window. \n*A '''fallen''' tree. \n*An '''interesting''' book.\n\nAnother use is in a phrase which serves as a shortened form of a [[relative clause]]:\n*A window '''broken''' by the wind.\n*A woman '''wearing''' a red hat. \n\nThese phrases are equivalent to \n\n*A window that was '''broken''' by the wind.\n*A woman who was '''wearing''' a red hat.\n\nSuch participle phrases generally follow the noun they describe, just as relative clauses do.\n\nOften a participle replaces an [[adverbial clause]]. For example:\n*With '''drawn''' sword, he came to the '''sleeping''' [[Lucretia]].\n\nIn the above sentence, the participles can be interpreted as equivalent to an adverbial clause of time, namely \"after he had drawn his sword\", and \"when she was sleeping\".\n\nA [[verb phrase]] based on a participle is called a '''participle phrase''' or '''participial phrase''' (''participial'' is an adjective derived from ''participle''). For example, ''wearing a hat'' and ''broken by the wind'' are participial phrases based respectively on an English present participle and past participle. Since these phrases are equivalent to a [[clause]], they may also be called a '''participle clause''' or '''participial clause'''. Participial clauses generally do not have an expressed [[grammatical subject]]; but occasionally a participial clause does include a subject, as in the English [[nominative absolute]] construction ''The king having died, ...'' .\n\nA fourth use of participles in some languages is in combination with an auxiliary verb such as \"has\" or \"is\" to make a compound or [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb tense which in other languages can often be expressed by a single word:\n*He '''had drawn''' his sword (= Latin ''strinxerat''). She '''was sleeping''' (= Latin ''dormiebat'').\n\n== Types of participle ==\nParticiples are often connected to certain [[grammatical tense]]s or [[grammatical aspect]]s. The two types of participle in Modern English are termed '''present participle''' and '''past participle''', respectively. However, [[David Crystal|Crystal]] indicated that \"there is a tendency to avoid the traditional terms (and use terms like ''-ing form'' and ''-ed/-en form'' instead)\".<ref>Crystal, David. (2008). ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics'' (6th ed.), pp. 351-352. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.</ref> Other grammar books also noted that the terms do not imply that they are tensed forms.<ref>Huddleston, Rodney. (2002). In Rodney Huddleston & Geoffrey K. Pullum (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'' (pp. 78-81). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref> The traditional terms are misleading because the present participle is often associated with the progressive (continuous) aspect, while the past participle is linked with the perfect aspect or passive voice. See the examples below:\n\n*They were just standing there.<ref>Participles \u2013 Present, Past and Perfect. ''Lingolia''. Retrieved from https://english.lingolia.com/en/grammar/verbs/participles</ref>\n*By the time you get home I will have cleaned the house.<ref>Hewings, Martin. (2005). Future continuous and future perfect (continuous). In ''Advanced Grammar in Use'' (2nd ed.), p. 22. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nThe first sentence is in the past tense, but a present participle was used to express the progressive aspect. The second sentence is in the future tense, but a past participle was used for the perfect meaning.\n\nParticiples may also be identified with a particular [[grammatical voice|voice]]: [[active voice|active]] or [[passive voice|passive]]. Some languages (such as Latin and Russian) have distinct participles for active and passive uses. In English, the present participle is essentially an active participle, while the past participle has both active and passive uses.\n\nThe following examples illustrate this:\n* I saw John '''eating''' his dinner. (Here ''eating'' is an active present participle).\n* The bus has '''gone'''. (Here ''gone'' is an active past participle).\n* The window was '''broken''' with a rock. (Here ''broken'' is a passive past participle)\n\nA distinction is also sometimes made between '''adjectival participles''' and '''adverbial participles'''. An adverbial participle (or a participial phrase/clause based on such a participle) plays the role of an [[adverbial]] ([[adverb]] phrase) in the sentence in which it appears, whereas an adjectival participle (or a participial phrase/clause based on one) plays the role of an [[adjective phrase]]. Some languages have different forms for the two types of participle; such languages include [[Russian grammar|Russian]]<ref name=ruspar>[http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/particip.html The Russian Participles].

Details can be found in the sections below or in the articles on the grammars of specific languages.\n\nSome descriptive grammars treat adverbial and adjectival participles as distinct [[lexical category|lexical categories]], while others include them both in a single category of participles.<ref name=ruspar/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kiss |first=Katalin E. |last2=Kiefer |first2=Ferenc |last3=Sipt\u00e1r |first3=P\u00e9ter |title=\u00daj magyar nyelvtan |edition=3. kiad\u00e1s |series=Osiris tank\u00f6nyvek |year=2003 |publisher=Osiris Kiad\u00f3 |location=Budapest |language=Hungarian |issn=1218-9855}}</ref> Sometimes different names are used; adverbial participles in certain languages may be called [[converb]]s, [[gerund]]s, or [[gerundive]]s (though this is not consistent with the meanings of the terms ''gerund'' or ''gerundive'' as normally applied to English or Latin), or [[transgressive (linguistics)|transgressive]]s.\n\nParticiples can be used adjectivally (i.e. without characteristics of canonical verbs) as ''[[attributive adjective]]s''. They then take neither [[object (grammar)|object]] complements nor modifiers that are typical of canonical verbs, but adjectivally attributive participles are capable of being modified by adverbs such as ''very'' or ''slightly''. The difference is illustrated by the following examples:\n*The subject '''interesting''' him at the moment is Greek history.\n*Greek history is a very '''interesting''' subject.\n\nIn the first sentence ''interesting'' functions transitively as a nonfinite verb that takes the object ''him'', thereby forming the phrase ''interesting him'', which constitutes an adjectival phrase that modifies the noun, ''subject''. However, in the second sentence ''interesting'' functions non-transitively; it instead acts as a prepositive adjective that can be modified by typical adverbs such as ''very'' or ''quite'' (or a prefix such as ''un-''). Similar examples are \"''interested'' people\", \"a ''frightened'' rabbit\", \"''fallen'' leaves\", \"''meat-eating'' animals\".\n\n==Indo-European languages==\n\n===Germanic languages===\n\n====Early English====\nIn [[Old English]], past participles of [[Germanic strong verb]]s were marked with a ''ge-'' prefix, as are most strong and weak past participles in Dutch and German today, and often by a vowel change in the stem. Those of weak verbs were marked by the ending ''-d'', with or without an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel before it. Modern English past participles derive from these forms (although the ''ge-'' prefix, which became ''y-'' in Middle English, has now been lost \u2014 except in some rare dialects such as the [[Dorset dialect]], where it takes the form of ''a-'').\n\nOld English present participles were marked with an ending in ''-ende'' (or ''-iende'' for verbs whose infinitives ended in ''-ian'').\n\n====Middle English====\nIn [[Middle English]], the form of the present participle varied across regions: ''-ende'' (southwest, southeast, [[English Midlands|Midlands]]), ''-inde'' (southwest, southeast), ''-and'' (north), ''-inge'' (southeast). The last is the one that became standard, falling together with the suffix ''-ing'' used to form [[verbal noun]]s. See [[-ing#Etymology|''-ing'' (etymology)]].\n\n====Modern English====\n{{anchor|Modern English}}\n[[Modern English]] verbs have two participles:<ref>Quirk et al., 3.9</ref>\n* The ''present participle'', also sometimes called the ''[[active voice|active]]'', ''[[imperfect]]'', or ''[[progressive aspect|progressive]]'' participle, takes the ending ''-ing'', for example ''doing'', ''seeing'', ''working'', ''running''. It is identical in form to the [[verbal noun]] and [[gerund]] (see below). The term ''present participle'' is sometimes used to include the gerund;<ref>For example, Quirk et al., 4.12.</ref> and the term \"gerund\u2013participle\" is also used.\n* The ''past participle'', also sometimes called the ''[[passive voice|passive]]'' or ''[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]'' participle, is identical to the [[simple past|past tense]] form (ending in ''-ed'') in the case of regular verbs, for example \"loaded\", \"boiled\", \"mounted\", but takes various forms in the case of [[English irregular verbs|irregular verbs]], such as ''done'', ''sung'', ''written'', ''put'', ''gone'', etc.\n\nIn addition various compound participles can be formed, such as ''having done'', ''being done'', ''having been doing'', ''having been done''.<ref>Quirk et al., 3.15.</ref>\n\nDetails of participle formation can be found under [[English verbs]] and [[List of English irregular verbs]].\n\nThe present participle, or participial phrases (clauses) formed from it, are used as follows:\n*to form the [[progressive aspect|progressive]] (continuous) aspect: ''Jim was '''sleeping'''.''\n*as an adjectival phrase that can modify a subject or object: ''The man '''standing''' over there is my uncle;'' ''We are a people '''clamoring''' for freedom''.\n*adverbially, the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] being understood to be the same as that of the main clause: '''''Looking''' at the plans, I gradually came to see where the problem lay.'' ''He shot the man, '''killing''' him.''\n*similarly, but with a different subject, placed before the participle (the [[nominative absolute]] construction): ''He and I '''having''' reconciled our differences, the project then proceeded smoothly.''\n*more generally as a clause or sentence modifier: ''Broadly '''speaking''', the project was successful.'' (See also [[dangling participle]].)\n\nPast participles, or participial phrases (clauses) formed from them, are used as follows:\n*to form the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspect: ''The chicken has '''eaten'''.''\n*to form the [[English passive voice|passive voice]]: ''The chicken was '''eaten'''.''\n*as an adjectival phrase: ''The chicken '''eaten''' by the children was contaminated.'' (See also [[reduced relative clause]].)\n*adverbially: '''''Eaten''' in this manner, the chicken presents no problem.''\n*in a nominative absolute construction, with a subject: ''The chicken '''eaten''', we returned home.''\n\nBoth types of participles are also often used adjectivally (see {{slink||Types of participle}} above). For instance:\n*\"An ''exciting'' adventure\" (i.e. one that excites) demonstrates a present participle that is used in an attributive sense.\n*\"The ''attached'' files\" (i.e. those that are attached) and \"Our ''fallen'' comrades\" (i.e. those who have fallen) demonstrate past participles that are used in an attributive sense.\nNote, however, that a past participle that complements a [[stative verb]] (e.g., \"The files that ''are attached'' or \"Our comrades who ''have fallen'') becomes a passive participle within a [[passive voice]] construct. Additionally, participles that express an adjectivally attributive meaning can be affixed to form adverbs, such as ''interestingly'' and ''excitedly''.\n\nThe [[gerund]] is distinct from the present participle. A gerund can function transitively (e.g., \"I like ''eating ice cream'') or intransitively (e.g., \"I like ''swimming''). In both instances, a gerund functions nominatively rather than adjectivally or adverbially whether as an object (e.g., \"I like ''sleeping''\") or as a subject (e.g., \"''Sleeping'' is not allowed.\") Although ''gerunds'' and ''present participles'' are morphologically identical, their grammatical functions differ substantially. Sometimes their morphological similarity can create contextual ambiguity, as [[Noam Chomsky]] pointed out in his well-known example:<ref>Noam Chomsky, ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,\n1965), 21.</ref>\n*'''''Flying''' planes can be dangerous.''\n\nWhen the meaning is \"The practice of flying a plane is dangerous,\" ''flying'' functions as a gerund; when the meaning is \"Planes that fly\" or \"Planes when they are flying\" (i.e., in contrast to ''grounded planes''), ''flying'' is being used adjectivally as a participle.\n\nFor more on the distinctions between these uses of the ''-ing'' verb form, see [[-ing#Uses|''-ing'': uses]].\n\nFor more details on uses of participles and other parts of verbs in English, see [[Uses of English verb forms]], including the sections on the [[Uses of English verb forms#Present participle|present participle]] and [[Uses of English verb forms#Past participle|past participle]].\n\n==== Scandinavian languages ====\nIn all of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] the past participle has to agree with the noun to some degree. All of the Scandinavian languages have mandatory agreement with the noun in number. [[Nynorsk]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] have mandatory agreement in both number and gender. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] have agreement in number, gender and case. For the present participle there is no agreement.\n\nExamples in [[Nynorsk]]:\n* '''Sj\u00f8lvk\u00f8yrande''' bilar kan vere farlege. (English: '''self-driving''' ''cars can be dangerous)''\n* Kyllingen vart '''eten''' (English: The chicken was '''eaten''')\n* Dyret vart '''ete''' (English: The animal was '''eaten''')\nThe participles are marked in bold. The first example involves a present participle and the two latter examples involves a past participle. All present participles end with an -ande suffix.\n\n===Latin and Romance languages===\n\n====Latin====\n{{main article|Latin syntax#Participles|Latin conjugation#Participles|Latin syntax#The gerundive}}\n\n[[Latin]] grammar was studied in Europe for hundreds of years, especially the handbook written by the 4th-century teacher [[Aelius Donatus]], and it is from Latin that the name and concept of the participle derives. According to Donatus there are four participles in Latin, as follows:<ref>Donatus, ''Ars Minor: de participio''.</ref>\n\n* '''present''' participle: present stem + ''-ns'' (gen. ''-ntis''); e.g. ''leg\u0113ns'' (plural ''legent\u0113s'')  \"(while) reading\"\n* '''perfect''' participle: [[Latin conjugation#Supine|supine]] stem + ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um''; e.g. ''l\u0113ctus'' \"read (by someone)\"\n* '''future''' participle: supine stem + ''-\u016brus'', ''-\u016bra'', ''-\u016brum''; e.g. ''l\u0113ct\u016brus''  \"going to read\", \"due to read\"\n* '''gerundive''' (sometimes<ref>cf. Wheelock, pp. 106ff and 112 note; Allen & Greenough, p. 315.</ref> considered the future passive participle): e.g. ''legendus'' \"due to be read\", \"necessary to be read\"\n\nHowever, many modern Latin grammars treat the gerundive as a separate part of speech.<ref>e.g. Kennedy, Gildersleeve & Lodge, etc.</ref>\n\nThe perfect participle is usually [[Passive voice|passive]] in meaning, and thus mainly formed from [[Transitive verb|transitive]] verbs, for example ''fr\u0101ctus'' \"broken\", ''missus'' \"sent (by someone)\". However, certain verbs (called [[deponent verb]]s) have a perfect participle in an [[Active verb|active]] sense, e.g. ''profectus'' \"having set out\", ''hort\u0101tus'' \"having encouraged\", etc. The present and future participles are always active, the gerundive usually passive.\n\nBecause a participle is an adjective as well as a verb, just like any other Latin adjective its ending changes according to the noun it describes. So when the noun is masculine, the participle must be masculine; when the noun is in the [[accusative case|accusative]] (object) case, the participle is also in the accusative case; when the noun has plural endings, the participle also has plural endings. Thus a simple participle such as ''fr\u0101ctus'' \"broken\" can change to ''fr\u0101cta'', ''fr\u0101ctum'', ''fr\u0101ct\u012b'', ''fr\u0101ct\u014d'' and so on, according to its gender, number, and case.\n\nA participle can have a descriptive meaning like an adjective, or a more dynamic meaning like a verb. Thus in the following sentence the participle ''str\u012bct\u014d'' \"drawn\" is better taken as describing an action (\"he drew his sword\" or \"after drawing his sword\") rather than as describing the sword (\"with a drawn sword\"):\n\n*'''''Str\u012bct\u014d''' gladi\u014d ad '''dormientem''' Lucr\u0113tiam v\u0113nit.''<ref>Livy, 1.58.2</ref><br />\"With '''drawn''' sword he came to the '''sleeping''' Lucretia.\"\n\nThe dynamic, verbal meaning is more common, and Latin often uses a participle where English might use a simple verb.\n\nThe present participle often describes the circumstances attending the main verb. A typical example is:\n*''Balbus ad m\u0113 v\u0113nit '''curr\u0113ns'''''.<ref>Cicero, ''ad Atticum'' 9.2a.3.</ref><br />\"Balbus came to me '''running'''.\"\n\nBoth the future and the perfect participle (but not the present participle) can be used with various tenses of the verb ''esse'' \"to be\" to make a compound tense such as the future-in-the-past or the perfect passive:\n*''E\u014d di\u0113 R\u014dmam '''vent\u016brus erat'''.''<ref>Cicero, ''pro Milone'' 28.</ref><br />\"On that day '''he was going to return''' to Rome.\"\n*'''''Occ\u012bsus est''' \u0101 Th\u0113b\u0101n\u012bs.''<ref>Nepos, ''Lysander'' 3.4.</ref><br />\"'''He was killed''' by the Thebans.\"\n\nThe perfect and future participles can also be used, with or without the verb ''esse'' \"to be\", in indirect speech clauses:\n*''(D\u012bxit e\u014ds) locum facile '''invent\u016br\u014ds''' (esse).''<ref>Nepos, ''Hannibal'' 12.3.</ref><br />\"He said that they were easily '''going to find''' the place / He said that they '''would find''' the place easily.\"\n\nFor uses of the gerundive, see [[Latin syntax#The gerundive]].\n\n====French====\nThere are two basic participles:\n*'''Present active participle''': formed by dropping the ''-ons'' of the ''nous'' form of the present tense of a verb (except with ''\u00eatre'' and ''avoir'') and then adding ''ant'': ''marchant'' \"walking\", ''\u00e9tant'' \"being\", ''ayant'' \"having\".\n*'''Past participle''': formation varies according to verb group: ''vendu'' \"sold\", ''mis'' \"placed\", ''march\u00e9'' \"walked\", ''\u00e9t\u00e9'' \"been\", and ''fait'' \"done\". The sense of the past participle is passive as an adjective and in most verbal constructions with \"avoir\", but active in verbal constructions with \"\u00eatre\", in reflexive constructions, and with some intransitive verbs.<ref>Maurice Grevisse, ''[[Le Bon Usage]]'', 10th edition, \u00a7 776.</ref>\n\nCompound participles are possible:\n*'''Present perfect participle''': ''ayant appel\u00e9'' \"having called\", ''\u00e9tant mort'' \"being dead\"\n*'''Passive perfect participle''': ''\u00e9tant vendu'' \"being sold, having been sold\"\n\nUsage:\n*'''Present participles''' are used as qualifiers as in \"un insecte '''volant'''\" (a flying insect) and in some other contexts. They are never used to form tenses. The present participle is used in subordinate clauses, usually with ''en'': \"Je marche, en parlant\".\n*'''Past participles''' are used as qualifiers for nouns: \"la table '''cass\u00e9e'''\" (the broken table); to form compound tenses such as the perfect \"Vous avez '''dit'''\" (you have said) and to form the passive voice: \"il a \u00e9t\u00e9 '''tu\u00e9'''\" (he/it has been killed).\n\n====Spanish====\nIn Spanish, the so-called present or active participle (''participio activo'' or ''participio de presente'') of a verb is traditionally formed with one of the suffixes ''-ante, -ente'' or ''-iente'', but modern grammar does not consider it a true participle, as such forms usually have the meaning of simple adjectives or nouns: e.g. ''amante'' \"loving\" or \"lover\", ''viviente'' \"living\" or \"live\".\n\nAnother participial form is known as the ''gerundio'', which ends in an (unchanging) suffix ''-ando'', ''-endo'', or ''-iendo''. The gerundio is used in combination with the verb ''estar'' (\"to be\") to make continuous tenses: for example, ''estar haciendo'' means \"to be doing\" (''haciendo'' being the ''gerundio'' of ''hacer'', \"to do\"), and there are related constructions such as ''seguir haciendo'' meaning \"to keep doing\" (''seguir'' being \"to continue\"). Another use is in phrases such as ''vino corriendo'' (\"he/she came running\") and ''lo vi corriendo'' (\"I saw him running\").\n\nThe past participle (''participio pasado'' or ''participio pasivo'') is regularly formed with one of the suffixes ''-ado'' or ''-ido''; but some verbs have an irregular form ending in ''-to'' (e.g. ''escrito, visto, puesto''), or ''-cho'' (e.g. ''dicho, hecho''). The past participle is used generally as an adjective referring to a finished action, in which case its ending changes according to gender and number. At other times is used to form compound tenses (as in English), in which case it is indeclinable. Some examples:\n\nAs an adjective:\n*''las cartas escritas'' \"the written letters\"\n\nTo form compound tenses:\n*''Ha escrito una carta.'' \"She (he, it) has written a letter.\"\n\n===Hellenic languages===\n\n====Ancient Greek====\n{{Main article|Participle (Ancient Greek)}}\nThe [[Ancient Greek]] participle shares in the properties of adjectives and verbs. Like an adjective, it changes form for [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical case|case]], and [[grammatical number|number]]. Like a verb, it has [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[voice (grammar)|voice]], is modified by [[adverb]]s, and can take [[verb argument]]s, including an [[object (grammar)|object]].<ref>{{Smyth|2039}}</ref> Participles are quite numerous in Ancient Greek: a non-defective verb has as many as ten participles.\n\nThere is a form of the participle for every combination of tense (present, aorist, perfect, future) and voice (active, middle, passive).  All participles are based on the stems of the corresponding tenses.

There is no [[consonant mutation|mutation]] in either case. In the passive voice, participles are usually replaced by a compound phrase such as ''wedi cael ei/eu'' (\"having got his/her/their ...ing\") in contemporary Welsh and by the impersonal form in classical Welsh.\n\n===Slavic languages===\n\n====Polish====\nThe Polish word for participle is ''imies\u0142\u00f3w'' ([[plural|pl.]]: ''imies\u0142owy''). There are four types of ''imies\u0142owy'' in two classes:\n\nAdjectival participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przymiotnikowy''):\n* active adjectival participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przymiotnikowy czynny''): ''robi\u0105cy'' \u2013 \"doing\", \"one who does\"\n* passive adjectival participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przymiotnikowy bierny''): ''robiony'' \u2013 \"being done\" (can only be formed off [[transitive verb]]s)\n\nAdverbial participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przys\u0142\u00f3wkowy''):\n* present adverbial participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przys\u0142\u00f3wkowy wsp\u00f3\u0142czesny''): robi\u0105c \u2013 \"doing\", \"while doing\"\n* perfect adverbial participle (''imies\u0142\u00f3w przys\u0142\u00f3wkowy uprzedni''): ''zrobiwszy'' \u2013 \"having done\" (formed in virtually all cases off verbs in their [[perfective aspect|perfective forms]], here denoted by the [[prefix]] ''z-'')\n\nDue to the distinction between adjectival and adverbial participles, in Polish it is practically impossible to make a [[dangling modifier|dangling participle]] in the classical English meaning of the term. For instance, in the sentence:\n\n*I found them hiding in the closet.\n\nit is unclear whether \"I\" or \"they\" were hiding in the closet. In Polish there is a clear distinction:\n\n* ''Znalaz\u0142em ich, chowaj\u0105c si\u0119 w szafie.'' \u2013 ''chowaj\u0105c'' is a present adverbial participle agreeing grammatically with the subject (\"I\")\n* ''Znalaz\u0142em ich chowaj\u0105cych si\u0119 w szafie.'' \u2013 ''chowaj\u0105cych'' is an active adjectival participle agreeing grammatically with the object (\"them\")\n\n====Russian====\nVerb: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250t\u02b2] (to hear, [[imperfective aspect]])\n\n*Present active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250.\u0255\u02d0\u026aj] \"hearing\", \"who hears\" \n*Present passive: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0268\u031e.m\u0268\u031ej] \"being heard\", \"that is heard\", \"audible\" \n*Past active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f.\u0282\u0268\u031ej] \"who heard\", \"who was hearing\" \n*Past passive: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250n.n\u0268\u031ej] \"that was heard\", \"that was being heard\" \n*[[adverbial participle|Adverbial]] present active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250] \"(while) hearing\" \n*Adverbial past active: \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432 [\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f] \" (while) hearing \"\n\nVerb: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250t\u02b2] (to hear, [[perfective aspect]])\n\n*Past active: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f.\u0282\u0268\u031ej] \"who has heard\"\n*Past passive: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250n.n\u0268\u031ej] \"who has been heard\"\n*Adverbial past active: \u0443\u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0432 [\u028a\u02c8s\u026b\u0268.\u0282\u0250f] \"having heard\"\n\nFuture participles formed from perfective verbs are not considered a part of standard language.<ref>[https://helsinki.academia.edu/KseniaShagal/Papers/1572263/Future_participles_in_Russian_Expanding_the_participial_paradigm Shagal (Krapivina), Future participles in Russian: Expanding the participial paradigm]</ref>\n\n====Bulgarian====\nParticiples are adjectives formed from verbs.

The following points may be noted:<ref>[http://www.seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=3 Macedonian Grammar], [[Victor Friedman]]</ref>\n* present active participle: this has transformed into a verbal adverb;\n* present passive participle: there are some isolated cases or remnants of the present passive participle, such as the word \u043b\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c [lakom] (greedy);\n* past active participle: there is only one remnant of the past active participle, which is the word \u0431\u0438\u0432\u0448 [biv\u0161] (former). However, this word is often replaced with the word \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d [porane\u0161en] (former);\n* past passive participle: this has been transformed into a verbal adjective (it behaves like a normal adjective);\n* resultative participle: this has transformed into a verbal l-form (\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043b-\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430). It is not a participle since it doesn't function attributively.\n\n===Baltic languages===\n\n====Lithuanian====\nAmong Indo-European languages, the [[Lithuanian language]] is unique for having fourteen different participial forms of the verb, which can be grouped into five when accounting for inflection by tense. Some of these are also inflected by gender and case. For example, the verb ''eiti'' (\"to go, to walk\") has the active participle forms ''ein\u0105s/einantis'' (\"going, walking\", present tense), ''\u0117j\u0119s'' (past tense), ''eisi\u0105s'' (future tense), ''eidav\u0119s'' (past frequentative tense), the passive participle forms ''einamas'' (\"being walked\", present tense), ''eitas'' (\u201cwalked\u201d past tense), ''eisimas'' (future tense), the adverbial participles ''einant'' (\"while [he, different subject] is walking\" present tense), ''\u0117jus'' (past tense), ''eisiant'' (future tense), ''eidavus'' (past frequentative tense), the semi-participle ''eidamas'' (\"while [he, the same subject] is going, walking\") and the participle of necessity ''eitinas'' (\"that which needs to be walked\"). The active, passive, and the semi-participles are inflected by gender, and the active, passive, and necessity ones are inflected by case.\n\n==Semitic languages==\n\n===Arabic===\n{{Main article|Arabic verbs#Participle|l1=Arabic verbs: Participle}}\nThe [[Arabic grammar#Verbs|Arabic verb]] has two participles: an active participle (\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644) and a passive participle (\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0639\u0648\u0644 ), and the form of the participle is predictable by inspection of the dictionary form of the verb. These participles are inflected for gender, number and case, but not person. Arabic participles are employed syntactically in a variety of ways: as nouns, as adjectives or even as verbs. Their uses vary across [[varieties of Arabic]]. In general the active participle describes a property of the syntactic subject of the verb from which it derives, whilst the passive participles describes the object. For example, from the verb \u0643\u062a\u0628 ''kataba'', the active participle is ''k\u0101tib'' \u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 and the passive participle is ''makt\u016bb'' \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628. Roughly these translate to \"writing\" and \"written\" respectively. However, they have different, derived lexical uses. \u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 ''k\u0101tib'' is further lexicalized as \"writer\", \"author\" and \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 ''makt\u016bb'' as \"letter\".\n\nIn [[Classical Arabic]] these participles do not participate in verbal constructions with auxiliaries the same way as their English counterparts do, and rarely take on a verbal meaning in a sentence (a notable exception being participles derived from [[Verb framing|motion verbs]] as well as participles in [[Qur'anic Arabic]]).  In certain [[dialects of Arabic]] however, it is much more common for the participles, especially the active participle, to have verbal force in the sentence. For example, in dialects of the [[Levant]], the active participle is a structure that describes the state of the syntactic subject after the action of the verb from which it derives has taken place. ''\u02bc\u0100kil'', the active participle of ''\u02bcakala'' (\"to eat\"), describes one's state after having eaten something.  Therefore, it can be used in analogous way to the English [[present perfect]] (for example, ''\u02bcAn\u0101 \u02bc\u0101kil'' \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0622\u0643\u0644 meaning \"I have eaten\", \"I have just eaten\" or \"I have already eaten\"). Other verbs, such as ''r\u0101\u1e25a'' \u0631\u0627\u062d (\"to go\") give a participle (''r\u0101yi\u1e25'' \u0631\u0627\u064a\u062d), which has a progressive (\"is going...\") meaning. The exact tense or continuity of these participles is therefore determined by the nature of the specific verb (especially its [[lexical aspect]] and its [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]]) and the syntactic/semantic context of the utterance. What ties them all together is that they describe the subject of the verb from which they derive. The passive participles in certain dialects can be used as a sort of [[passive voice]], but more often than not, are used in their various lexicalized senses as adjectives or nouns.\n\n==Finno-Ugric languages==\n\n===Finnish===\nFinnish uses six participles to convey different meanings. Below is a table displaying the declension of the participles of the verb '''tappaa''' (to kill).\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Finnish Participles\n!\n! Active\n! Passive\n|-\n! Present\n| tappava || tapettava\n|-\n! Past\n| tappanut\n| tapettu\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Agent\n| tappama-\n|-\n! Negative\n| tappamaton\n|}\n\nThe participles work in the following way:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|tappava\n| '''Present active participle:''' Conveys an ongoing action. Used to omit the use of the relative pronoun ''who'', ''which'' or ''that''. Tappava means \"killing\" as in \"killing machine\". In other words, machine ''that'' kills. It can also work as the subject of the sentence. In other words, tappava can mean \"the one who kills\" or \"he who kills\". Tappava on... = He who kills is...\n|-\n|tapettava\n| '''Present passive participle:''' Conveys possibility and obligation. Possibility as in -able (killable) and obligation as in ''something that has to be killed''. ''Tapettava mies'' can mean both \"the killable man\" (possibility) and \"the man who has to be killed\" (obligation).\n|-\n|tappanut\n| '''Past active participle:''' Used with the verb ''olla'' (to be) to construct the perfect and the past perfect tenses. In English the verb \"to have\" is used to form the perfect and past perfect tense (I '''have'''/'''had''' killed), in Finnish the verb \"to be\" is used instead (min\u00e4 '''olen'''/'''olin''' tappanut). Just like the present active participle, it can also be used as the subject in a sentence, except it conveys the meaning in the past tense. In other words, tappanut can mean \"the one who killed\" or \"he who killed\". Tappanut on... = He who killed is...\n|-\n|tapettu\n| '''Past passive participle:''' A concluded action. Tapettu mies = the killed man.\n|-\n|tappama-\n| '''Agent participle:''' Always used with a possessive suffix. It is used to convey the meaning of the word \"by\" in English, since there is no word for \"by\" in Finnish. H\u00e4nen tappa'''mansa''' mies = The man killed '''by him'''. The tense of the translation depends on the context.\n|-\n|tappamaton\n| '''Negative participle:''' Used to convey impossibility (unkillable) and undoneness (not killed). Tappamaton mies means both \"unkillable man\" and \"man (who is) not killed\".\n|}\n\nEach and every one of these participles can be used as adjectives, which means that some of them can be turned into nouns.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Finnish (adjective)\n| tappava || tapettava || tappamaton\n|-\n! English (adjective)\n| killing || killable || unkillable (possibility) or ''not killed'' (undoneness)\n|-\n! Finnish (noun)\n| tappavuus || tapettavuus || tappamattomuus\n|-\n! English (noun)\n| killingness || killability || unkillability (possibility) or ''lack of killing'' (undoneness)\n|}\n\n==Turkic languages==\n\n===Turkish===\nParticiples are called ''s\u0131fat-fiil'' (lit. adjective-verb) or ''orta\u00e7'' in Turkish.<ref>Ergin 309</ref>\n\nTurkish participles consist of a verb stem and a suffix. Some participles may be conjugated, but some may not. Participles always precede the noun they are defining, as in English.\n\nParticiple suffixes, like many other suffixes in Turkish, change according to the [[vowel harmony]] and [[sandhi]].\n\nThere are eight types of participle suffixes; ''-en'', ''-esi'', ''-mez'', ''-ar'', ''-di(k/\u011fi)'' ''-ecek'' and ''-mi\u015f'' <ref>Ergin 310</ref><ref name=\"y\u0131ld\u0131z\">[http://www.sosbil.aku.edu.tr/dergi/II2/11-Gurer-gulsevin.pdf  D\u00e2sit\u00e2n-\u0131 Sult\u00e2n Mahm\u00fbd Mesnevisi'nde Fiiller, S\u00fcleyman Demirel \u00dcniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi], Osman Y\u0131ld\u0131z, May 2007 (PDF)</ref>\n\n==Austronesian languages==\n\n===Malay and Indonesian===\n{{Main|Malay grammar}}\n\n[[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] use prefixes such as ''di-'' (intentional), ''ter-'' (accidental) or ''sudah''.\n\n==Eskimo-Aleut languages==\n\n===Sireniki Eskimo===\n[[Sireniki Eskimo language]], an extinct [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut language]], has separate sets of ''adverbial participles'' and ''adjectival participles''. Different from in English, adverbial participles are conjugated to reflect the person and number of their implicit subjects; hence, while in English a sentence like \"If ''I'' were a marksman, ''I'' would kill walruses\" requires two full clauses (to distinguish the two verbs' different subjects), in Sireniki Eskimo one of these may be replaced with an adverbial participle (since its conjugation indicates the subject).\n\n==Constructed languages==\n\n===Esperanto===\n{{Main article|Esperanto grammar#Participles|l1=Esperanto grammar: Participles}}\n\n[[Esperanto]] has six different participle conjugations; active and passive for past, present and future. The participles are formed as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Past\n! Present\n! Future\n|-\n| '''Active'''\n| -inta\n| -anta\n| -onta\n|-\n| '''Passive'''\n| -ita\n| -ata\n| -ota\n|}\nFor example, a ''falonta botelo'' is a bottle that will fall or is about to fall. A ''falanta botelo'' is one that is falling through the air. After it hits the floor, it is a ''falinta botelo.'' These examples use the active participles, but the usage of the passive participles is similar. A cake that is going to be divided is a ''dividota kuko''. When it is in the process of being divided, it is a ''dividata kuko''. Having been cut, it is now a ''dividita kuko''.\n\nThese participles can be used in conjunction with the verb to be, ''esti'', forming 18 compound tenses (9 active and 9 passive). However, this soon becomes complicated and often unnecessary, and is only frequently used when rigorous translation of English is required. An example of this would be ''la knabo estos instruita'', or, the boy will have been taught. This example sentence is then in the future anterior.\n\nWhen the suffix ''-o'' is used, instead of ''-a'', then the participle refers to a person. A ''man\u011danto'' is someone who is eating. A ''man\u011dinto'' is someone who ate. A ''man\u011donto'' is someone who will eat. Also, a ''man\u011dito'' is someone who was eaten, a ''man\u011dato'' is someone who is being eaten, and a ''man\u011doto'' is someone who will be eaten.\n\nThese rules hold true for all transitive verbs. Since copular and intransitive verbs do not have passive voice, their participle forms can only be active.\n\nAn informal and unofficial addition to these six are the participles for conditional forms, which use ''-unt-'' and ''-ut-''.  For example, ''parolunto'' refers to someone who would speak (or would have spoken), and a ''leguta libro'' is a book that would be read (or have been read). These unofficial participle forms are however very rarely used in practice, and more often as a linguistic joke than in a serious way.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attributive verb]]\n*[[Gerund]]\n*[[Grammar]]\n*[[Hanging participle]]\n*[[Nonfinite verb]]\n*[[Transgressive (linguistics)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/047.html Participles] from the ''American Heritage Book of English Usage'' (1996).\n*Quirk, R; Greenbaum, S; Leech, G.; Svartvik, J.

When he refused to implicate his benefactor Amin in treason, Obote had him arrested and flown to Khartoum on January 8, 1971, charged with \"crimes against Africa.\"<ref name=2Sudans/><ref name=Birth/> On 18 January 1971, Steiner appeared at a press conference in Khartoum, where he admitted that he worked as a mercenary, but denied having fought for Anyanya, saying he only served the Anyidi Revolutionary Government.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Steiner gave his own assessment of the Anyanya guerrillas, saying they fought well against each other, but less well against the Sudanese Army.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He described Anyanya as riven by factionalism, personality conflicts and an inability to co-ordinate the political and military aspects of the war.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He also stated Anyanya had much difficulty overcoming ethnic conflicts as the guerrillas disliked fighting outside of their home regions and that he prepared several ambushes of the Sudanese that failed when one or more of the \"resistance platoons\" failed to co-ordinate or even to show up at all.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}}\n\nSteiner's trial in Khartoum between 5 August-9 September 1971 attracted international publicity, not the least because of Steiner's tendency to gave rambling speeches before the court and to make bizarre claims.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76-77}} The Muslim Arab government in Khartoum always maintained that the Christian blacks of south Sudan had no grievances, and the rebellion was merely the work of outsiders stirring the southerners up, so putting a mercenary on trial was a great propaganda coup for the Nimeiry regime.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} Ignoring the fact that rebellion had started long before Steiner had arrived in 1969, the Nimeiry regime vastly exaggerated Steiner's role in the war as it portrayed him as the mastermind behind the rebellion who had duped gullible Africans into fighting against Khartoum.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}}  He spent three years in prison, where he was severely tortured, and was eventually sentenced to death by the Sudanese courts, which was commuted to twenty years on \"humanitarian\" grounds.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} The same Israeli agent expressed regret to Martell that he had pressured Lagu to expel Steiner, saying: \"If I had known he would had been tortured like this, I would not had let it happen. What is the point to torture this person? He did nothing bad\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} During his time in Khartoum, he was the subject of an East German documentary.

It seemed to me that he was there building himself a little kingdom\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93}} \n\nReed stated that Steiner claimed to him that he was working for MI6 and the Central Intelligence Agency, but Reed was skeptical of these claims, saying: \"He didn't deliver any goods. Any major Western intelligence agency could at least get him some machine guns or munitions...It was really quite strange. It was quite a pathetic looking place\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93-94}} The locals told Reed that the previous year Steiner had ordered them to build an airfield, saying that \"plane loads of arms and relief aid\" from the West would then be flown in.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Of the airfield that had been built in 1969, Reed stated: \"So the people chopped down the trees and built a grass runway. It was completely overrun with weeds. The people said that no planes had ever come\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Steiner was noted for his eccentric training and leadership methods such as firing his gun near the feet of sentries he caught sleeping at night, making recruits ride leap swings through fires, and making trainees sit in a circle with their feet facing a mortar tube while he fired a round.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} The people of the southern Sudan remembered Steiner as a strange and terrifying character, but he believed he was acting in their best interest, telling one journalist in 1970: \"I'm an extremist. The Africans need my help\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Martell wrote about Steiner: \"He was addicted to the thrill  of combat-or at least to bask in the reputation of that. Coupled with a love of guns and an arrogant political naivety that he could make a change, it was a dangerous mix\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}}\n\nIn late 1969-early 1970, there was heavy fighting as the new Sudanese president, General [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] who just overthrown the previous government in May 1969, ordered an offensive to retake southern Sudan.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} Under the impact of the offensive, Anyidi Revolutionary Government collapsed in April 1970.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The Anyidi Revolutionary Government was cornered between forces of the Nile Provisional Government and another faction loyal to Colonel [[Joseph Lagu]] who like Tafeng wanted to overthrow Muortat.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=80}} Tafeng made a bargain where he disbanded his government and recognized the authority of Lagu, who was hostile towards Steiner.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=80}} After a lull in the spring, the fighting resumed and in September-October 1970 several Anyanya camps were taken by the Sudanese Army.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} Among the camps captured were Tafeng's camp at Morta where Steiner had been based.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} By this point, Steiner was wandering around Southern Sudan aimlessly as the main Anyanya leaders distrusted him.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The British historian [[Edgar O'Ballance]] wrote: \"Steiner had hardly made any impression in the south, which in general seemed embarrassed by his former presence there...\"..{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} \n\nEventually he quarreled with Colonel [[Joseph Lagu]], an Anyanya leader, and was ordered by Lagu to leave the Sudan. Israel was backing the Anyanya rebellion of the black southern Sudanese against the Muslim Arab northerners, and the Israelis had singled out Lagu as the most able of Anyanya leaders.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} The Israelis felt that Steiner was a \"loose cannon\" and objected to a man who spent his youth in the Nazi ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]''.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} One former Israeli agent attached to Anyanya told Martell: \"I told Lagu, either Steiner leaves or we get out\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} In November 1970, Steiner returned to Uganda and was immediately arrested.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Deciding to return to Europe, Steiner stopped in Kampala, Uganda and unwittingly became involved in the power struggle between Amin and President [[Milton Obote]]. When he refused to implicate his benefactor Amin in treason, Obote had him arrested and flown to Khartoum on January 8, 1971, charged with \"crimes against Africa.\"<ref name=2Sudans/><ref name=Birth/> On 18 January 1971, Steiner appeared at a press conference in Khartoum, where he admitted that he worked as a mercenary, but denied having fought for Anyanya, saying he only served the Anyidi Revolutionary Government.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Steiner gave his own assessment of the Anyanya guerrillas, saying they fought well against each other, but less well against the Sudanese Army.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He described Anyanya as riven by factionalism, personality conflicts and an inability to co-ordinate the political and military aspects of the war.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He also stated Anyanya had much difficulty overcoming ethnic conflicts as the guerrillas disliked fighting outside of their home regions and that he prepared several ambushes of the Sudanese that failed when one or more of the \"resistance platoons\" failed to co-ordinate or even to show up at all.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}}\n\nSteiner's trial in Khartoum between 5 August-9 September 1971 attracted international publicity, not the least because of Steiner's tendency to gave rambling speeches before the court and to make bizarre claims.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76-77}} The Muslim Arab government in Khartoum always maintained that the Christian blacks of south Sudan had no grievances, and the rebellion was merely the work of outsiders stirring the southerners up, so putting a mercenary on trial was a great propaganda coup for the Nimeiry regime.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} Ignoring the fact that rebellion had started long before Steiner had arrived in 1969, the Nimeiry regime vastly exaggerated Steiner's role in the war as it portrayed him as the mastermind behind the rebellion who had duped gullible Africans into fighting against Khartoum.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}}  He spent three years in prison, where he was severely tortured, and was eventually sentenced to death by the Sudanese courts, which was commuted to twenty years on \"humanitarian\" grounds.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} The same Israeli agent expressed regret to Martell that he had pressured Lagu to expel Steiner, saying: \"If I had known he would had been tortured like this, I would not had let it happen. What is the point to torture this person? He did nothing bad\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} During his time in Khartoum, he was the subject of an East German documentary. Steiner has denied that the East Germans tortured him, noting that they got him to talk by supplying him with beer (a rarity in the Sudan, which enforces ''sharia'' law and bans alcohol).<ref name=\"Kulke\">{{cite news |last1=Kulke |first1=Ulli |title=Rolf Steiner, ein Welt-Krieger in eigener Mission|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article120818373/Rolf-Steiner-ein-Welt-Krieger-in-eigener-Mission.html |accessdate=14 April 2020 |publisher=Der Welt |date=11 October 2013}}</ref> It was only through pressure from the West German government that he was finally released from prison in March 1974.
