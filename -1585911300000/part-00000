Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs. The SD specification defines a card called '''Thin SD''' with a thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm, but they occur only rarely, as the SDA went on to define even smaller form factors.\n* The card's electrical contacts are recessed beneath the surface of the card, protecting them from contact with a user's fingers.\n* The SD specification envisioned capacities and transfer rates exceeding those of MMC, and both of these functionalities have grown over time. For a comparison table, see [[#Comparison to other flash memory formats|below]].\n* While MMC uses a single pin for data transfers, the SD card added a four-wire bus mode for higher data rates.\n* The SD card added [[Content Protection for Recordable Media]] (CPRM) security circuitry for [[digital rights management]] (DRM) content-protection.\n* Addition of a write-protect notch\n\nFull-size SD cards do not fit into the slimmer MMC slots, and other issues also affect the ability to use one format in a host device designed for the other.\n\n===SDHC===\n[[File:SDHC-Logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) logo; the specification defines cards with a capacity of more than {{No wrap|2 GiB}} up to {{nowrap|32 GiB}}]]\n\nThe Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) format, announced in January 2006 and defined in version 2.0 of the SD specification, supports cards with capacities up to 32&nbsp;GiB (34359738368 bytes).<ref name=\"sdcard_capacity\" /> The SDHC trademark is licensed to ensure compatibility.<ref name=sandisk-sdhc>[http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf What are SDHC, miniSDHC, and microSDHC?] SanDisk.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916035153/http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf |date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSDHC cards are physically and electrically identical to standard-capacity SD cards (SDSC).

Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org}}</ref><ref name=\"sda_logos_2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/pdf/2017SDA_brochure_eng.pdf|title=SD Standards Brochure 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings: the original Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Video Speed Class.\n\n===== Speed Class =====\n'''Speed Class''' ratings 2, 4, and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10&nbsp;MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> By comparison, the older \"\u00d7\" rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).\n\n===== UHS Speed Class =====\nUHS-I and UHS-II cards can use '''UHS Speed Class''' rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance of at least 10&nbsp;MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30&nbsp;MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording [[4K video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/home/New_SDXC_and_SDHC_Memory_Cards_Now_Support_4K2K_Video_11-6-2013_FINAL_2.pdf |title=NEW SDXC AND SDHC MEMORY CARDS SUPPORT 4K2K VIDEO |publisher=SD Association |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> Before November 2013, the rating was branded ''UHS Speed Grade'' and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.\n\nUHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices. The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with [[tapeless camcorder]]s while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos.\n\n===== Video Speed Class =====\n'''Video Speed Class''' defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern [[Multi-level cell|MLC NAND flash]] memory<ref name=\"sd50_video_speed\"/> and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6-90&nbsp;MB/s.<ref name=\"sda_video_speed\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\"/> The graphical symbols use 'V' followed by a number designating write speed (V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90).\n\n===== Comparison =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Comparison of SD card Speed Class ratings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org|accessdate=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Minimum sequential writing speed\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | [[Video format]]{{Efn|The necessary recording and playback speed class requirements may vary by device.}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | UHS Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | Video Speed Class \n! scope=\"col\" | [[Standard-definition television|SD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[High-definition video|HD]]/[[Full HD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[4K resolution|4K]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[8K resolution|8K]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|2 [[MB/s]]}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 2.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 2 (C2)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| rowspan=\"7\" {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" {{No}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|4 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 4.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 4 (C4)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}}  \n| rowspan=\"6\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|6 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (C6)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (V6)}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|10 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (C10)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 1.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 1 (U1)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (V10)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|30 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 3.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 3 (U3)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 30.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 30 (V30)}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|60 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 60.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 60 (V60)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|90 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 90.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 90 (V90)}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==== Application Performance Class ====\n''Application Performance Class'' is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification 5.1 and 6.0 which not only define sequential Reading Speeds but also mandates a minimum [[IOPS]] for reading and writing.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.\n\n====Write-protect notch====\n[[File:SD card unlocked and locked.svg|thumb|Unlocked and locked SD cards]]\n[[File:Sony toughcard notch less design.jpg|thumb|Sony 128GB SF-G Tough Series UHS-II SDXC Memory Card is one of the few cards in the market without a sliding tab on the write protect notch.]]\n\nMost full-size SD cards have a \"mechanical write protect switch\" allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: ''\"It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/index.html|title=Simplified Specifications - SD Association, version 3.10 , Part 1, Physical Layer, section 4.3.6\" Write Protect Management\"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdcard.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref> Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.\n\nThe switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''One-bit SD bus mode:''' Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.\n* '''Four-bit SD bus mode:''' Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.\n\nThe physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two V<sub>SS</sub> (Ground) pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |title=SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 4.10 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232415/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:MMC-SD-miniSD-microSD-Color-Numbers-Names.gif|thumb|upright|Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], SD, miniSD, microSD.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speed|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]].

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hjreggel.net/cardspeed/special-sd.html | contribution = SD Compatibility | title = Card speed \u2013 Card Readers and Memory Cards | date = December 1, 2006 | publisher = HJ Reggel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/33338344/winxp-sp3-cant-read-4gb.aspx |title=WinXP SP3 cannot read 4GB SD card in multicard reader |publisher=Egg head cafe | accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===SDSC cards above 1 GB===\n[[File:Sd4gy crop.jpg|thumb|4&nbsp;GB SDSC card]]\n\nA host device can ask any inserted SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged.

Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs.

Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org}}</ref><ref name=\"sda_logos_2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/pdf/2017SDA_brochure_eng.pdf|title=SD Standards Brochure 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings: the original Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Video Speed Class.\n\n===== Speed Class =====\n'''Speed Class''' ratings 2, 4, and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10&nbsp;MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> By comparison, the older \"\u00d7\" rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).\n\n===== UHS Speed Class =====\nUHS-I and UHS-II cards can use '''UHS Speed Class''' rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance of at least 10&nbsp;MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30&nbsp;MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording [[4K video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/home/New_SDXC_and_SDHC_Memory_Cards_Now_Support_4K2K_Video_11-6-2013_FINAL_2.pdf |title=NEW SDXC AND SDHC MEMORY CARDS SUPPORT 4K2K VIDEO |publisher=SD Association |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> Before November 2013, the rating was branded ''UHS Speed Grade'' and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.\n\nUHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices. The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with [[tapeless camcorder]]s while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos.\n\n===== Video Speed Class =====\n'''Video Speed Class''' defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern [[Multi-level cell|MLC NAND flash]] memory<ref name=\"sd50_video_speed\"/> and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6-90&nbsp;MB/s.<ref name=\"sda_video_speed\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\"/> The graphical symbols use 'V' followed by a number designating write speed (V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90).\n\n===== Comparison =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Comparison of SD card Speed Class ratings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org|accessdate=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Minimum sequential writing speed\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | [[Video format]]{{Efn|The necessary recording and playback speed class requirements may vary by device.}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | UHS Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | Video Speed Class \n! scope=\"col\" | [[Standard-definition television|SD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[High-definition video|HD]]/[[Full HD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[4K resolution|4K]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[8K resolution|8K]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|2 [[MB/s]]}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 2.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 2 (C2)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| rowspan=\"7\" {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" {{No}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|4 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 4.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 4 (C4)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}}  \n| rowspan=\"6\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|6 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (C6)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (V6)}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|10 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (C10)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 1.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 1 (U1)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (V10)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|30 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 3.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 3 (U3)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 30.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 30 (V30)}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|60 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 60.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 60 (V60)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|90 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 90.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 90 (V90)}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==== Application Performance Class ====\n''Application Performance Class'' is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification 5.1 and 6.0 which not only define sequential Reading Speeds but also mandates a minimum [[IOPS]] for reading and writing.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.\n\n====Write-protect notch====\n[[File:SD card unlocked and locked.svg|thumb|Unlocked and locked SD cards]]\n[[File:Sony toughcard notch less design.jpg|thumb|Sony 128GB SF-G Tough Series UHS-II SDXC Memory Card is one of the few cards in the market without a sliding tab on the write protect notch.]]\n\nMost full-size SD cards have a \"mechanical write protect switch\" allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: ''\"It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/index.html|title=Simplified Specifications - SD Association, version 3.10 , Part 1, Physical Layer, section 4.3.6\" Write Protect Management\"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdcard.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref> Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.\n\nThe switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''One-bit SD bus mode:''' Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.\n* '''Four-bit SD bus mode:''' Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.\n\nThe physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two V<sub>SS</sub> (Ground) pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |title=SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 4.10 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232415/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:MMC-SD-miniSD-microSD-Color-Numbers-Names.gif|thumb|upright|Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], SD, miniSD, microSD.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speed|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]]. This lets them operate like the [[hard disk]] of a [[personal computer]]. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system:\n\n* For SDSC cards:\n** Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors<!-- This is the exact condition as per the SD card spec.

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hjreggel.net/cardspeed/special-sd.html | contribution = SD Compatibility | title = Card speed \u2013 Card Readers and Memory Cards | date = December 1, 2006 | publisher = HJ Reggel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/33338344/winxp-sp3-cant-read-4gb.aspx |title=WinXP SP3 cannot read 4GB SD card in multicard reader |publisher=Egg head cafe | accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===SDSC cards above 1 GB===\n[[File:Sd4gy crop.jpg|thumb|4&nbsp;GB SDSC card]]\n\nA host device can ask any inserted SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged.

She was the world's largest ship until the completion of {{RMS|Olympic}} in 1911. ''Mauretania'' became a favourite among her passengers. She captured the Eastbound [[Blue Riband]] on her maiden return voyage in December 1907, then claimed the Westbound Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing during her 1909 season. She held both speed records for 20 years.<ref name=cross41>Maxtone-Graham 1972, pp. 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe ship's name was taken from the ancient Roman province of [[Mauretania]] on the northwest African coast, not the modern [[Mauritania]] to the south.<ref name=maxtone24>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 24.</ref> Similar nomenclature was also employed by ''Mauretania''{{'}}s running mate {{RMS|Lusitania||2}}, which was named after the Roman province directly north of Mauretania, across the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]<ref name=maxtone24/> in Portugal. ''Mauretania'' remained in service until 1934 when Cunard White Star retired her; scrapping commenced in 1935.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Mauretaniastabbs.jpg|thumb|left|''Mauretania'' during a speed trial off [[St. Abbs]], Scotland, 18 September 1907.

With a speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}, she captured the Blue Riband from Cunard Line's {{RMS|Campania||2}} and {{RMS|Lucania||2}}. Germany came to dominate the Atlantic, and by 1906 they had five [[four funnel liner|four-funnel]] [[superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]] in service, four of them owned by [[North German Lloyd]] and part of the so-called \"{{sclass2-|Kaiser|ocean liner|4}}\".\n\nAt around the same time the American financier [[J. P. Morgan]]'s [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] was attempting to monopolise the shipping trade, and had already acquired Britain's other major transatlantic line, [[White Star Line|White Star]].<ref name=cross11>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn the face of these threats the Cunard Line was determined to regain the prestige of dominance in ocean travel not only for the company, but also for the United Kingdom.<ref name=cross11/><ref name=palaces>''Floating Palaces.''

Peskett's original configuration for the ships in 1902 was a three-funnel design, when reciprocating engines were destined to be the powerplant. A giant model of the ships appeared in ''Shipbuilder's'' magazine in this configuration. Cunard decided to change power plants to Parson's new turbine technology, and the ship's design was again modified when Peskett added a fourth funnel to the ship's profile. Construction of the vessel finally began with the laying of the keel in August 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectionsprojects.org.uk/mauretania/story-construction.html|title=Mauretania|website=collectionsprojects.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, ''Mauretania'' was launched by the [[Anne Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe|Duchess of Roxburghe]].<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 25.</ref> At the time of her launch, she was the largest moving structure ever built,<ref name=tynestart>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/mauretania/story-construction.html|title=RMS Mauretania Construction|publisher=Tyne and Wear Archives Service|accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref> and slightly larger in gross tonnage than ''Lusitania''. The main visual differences between ''Mauretania'' and ''Lusitania'' were that ''Mauretania'' was five feet longer and had different vents.<ref>Layton 2007, p. 44.</ref> ''Mauretania'' also had two extra stages of turbine blades in her forward turbines, making her slightly faster than ''Lusitania''. ''Mauretania'' and ''Lusitania'' were the only ships with direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s to hold the Blue Riband; in later ships, reduction-geared turbines were mainly used.<ref>Williams, Trevor. (1982) A short history of twentieth-century technology.

The ship's interior was designed by [[Harold Peto]], architect, and her public rooms were fitted out by two notable London design houses \u2013 Ch. Mellier & Sons and Turner and Lord,<ref name=tynefit>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/mauretania/story-fitting%20out.html|title=RMS Mauretania Fitting Out|publisher=Tyne and Wear Archives Service|accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 31.</ref> with twenty-eight different types of wood, along with marble, tapestries, and other furnishings such as the stunning octagon table in the smoking room.<ref name=tynefit/><ref name=maxtone33>Maxtone-Graham 1972, pp. 33\u201336.</ref> Wood panelling for her first class public rooms was supposedly carved by three hundred craftsmen from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] but this seems unlikely, unnecessary and was probably executed by the yard or subcontracted, as were the majority of the second and third class areas.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 33.</ref> The multi-level first-class dining saloon of straw oak was decorated in [[Francis I style]] and topped by a large dome [[skylight (window)|skylight]].<ref name=maxtone33/> A series of elevators, then a rare new feature for liners, with grilles composed of the relatively new lightweight aluminum, were installed next to ''Mauretania''{{'}}s walnut grand staircase.<ref name=maxtone33/> A new feature was the Verandah Caf\u00e9 on the boat deck, where passengers were served beverages in a weather-protected environment, although this was enclosed within a year as it proved unrealistic.<ref name=tynefit/>\n\n==Comparison with the ''Olympic'' class==\nThe [[White Star Line]]'s {{sclass-|Olympic|ocean liner|0}} vessels were almost {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} longer and slightly wider than ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''. This made the White Star vessels about 15,000 [[gross register tonnage|gross register tons]] larger than the Cunard vessels. Both ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' were launched and had been in service for several years before ''Olympic'', ''Titanic'' and ''Britannic'' were ready for the North Atlantic run. Although significantly faster than the ''Olympic'' class would be, the speed and port turnaround times of Cunard's vessels was not sufficient to allow the line to run a weekly two-ship transatlantic service from each side of the Atlantic. A third ship was needed for a weekly service, and in response to White Star's announced plan to build the three ''Olympic''-class ships, Cunard ordered a third ship: {{RMS|Aquitania|3=2}}. Like {{RMS|Olympic||2}}, Cunard's ''Aquitania'' had a lower service speed, but was a larger and more luxurious vessel.\n\nBecause of their increased size the ''Olympic''-class liners could offer many more amenities than ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''. Both ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' offered swimming pools, [[Turkish bath]]s, a gymnasium, a [[squash court]], large reception rooms, \u00c0 la Carte restaurants separate from the dining saloons, and many more staterooms with private bathroom facilities than their two Cunard rivals.\n\nHeavy vibrations as a by-product of the four [[steam turbine]]s on ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' plagued both ships throughout their careers. When ''Lusitania'' sailed at top speed the vibrations were so severe that Second and Third Class sections of the ship could become uninhabitable.<ref>Archibald, Rick & Ballard, Robert.''The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard,'' Thunder Bay Press: 2005; p. 46.</ref> In contrast, the ''Olympic''-class liners utilized two traditional [[reciprocating engine]]s and only one turbine for the central propeller, which greatly reduced vibration. Because of their greater tonnage and wider beam, the ''Olympic''-class liners were also more stable at sea and less prone to rolling. ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' both featured straight prows in contrast to the angled prows of the ''Olympic'' liners. Designed so that the ships could plunge through a wave rather than crest it, the unforeseen consequence was that the Cunard liners would pitch forward alarmingly, even in calm weather, allowing huge waves to splash the bow and forward part of the superstructure.<ref>Archibald, Rick & Ballard, Robert.\"The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard,\" Thunder Bay Press: 2005; pp. 51-52.</ref>\n\n[[File:RMS Olympic & RMS Mauretania.jpg|thumb|White Star's ''Olympic'' (foreground) and Cunard's ''Mauretania'' (background)]]\nThe vessels of the ''Olympic'' class also differed from ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' in the way in which they were compartmented below the waterline. The White Star vessels were divided by transverse watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]]. While ''Lusitania'' also had transverse bulkheads, it also had longitudinal bulkheads running along the ship on each side, between the boiler and engine rooms and the coal bunkers on the outside of the vessel. The British commission that had investigated the sinking of {{RMS|Titanic||2}} in 1912 heard testimony on the flooding of coal bunkers lying outside longitudinal bulkheads. Being of considerable length, when flooded, these could increase the ship's list and \"make the lowering of the boats on the other side impracticable\"{{sfn|Titanic Inquiry}} \u2014 and this was precisely what later happened with ''Lusitania''. Furthermore, the ship's [[ship stability|stability]] was insufficient for the bulkhead arrangement used: flooding of only three coal bunkers on one side could result in negative [[metacentric height]].{{sfn|Layton|2010|page=55}} On the other hand, ''Titanic'' was given ample stability and sank with only a few degrees list, the design being such that there was very little risk of unequal flooding and possible capsize.{{sfn|Hackett|Bedford|1996|page=171}}\n\n''Lusitania'' did not carry enough lifeboats for all her passengers, officers and crew on board at the time of her maiden voyage (actually carrying four lifeboats fewer than ''Titanic'' would carry in 1912). This was a common practice for large passenger ships at the time, since the belief was that in busy shipping lanes help would always be nearby and the few boats available would be adequate to ferry all aboard to rescue ships before a sinking. After ''Titanic'' sank, ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' would be equipped with only an additional six more [[clinker (boat building)|clinker-built]] wooden boats under [[davit]]s, making for a total of 22 boats rigged in davits. The rest of their lifeboat accommodations were supplemented with 26 collapsible lifeboats, 18 stored directly beneath the regular lifeboats and eight on the after deck. The collapsibles were built with hollow wooden bottoms and canvas sides, and needed assembly in the event they had to be used.{{sfn|Simpson|1972|page=159}}\n\nThis contrasted with ''Olympic'' and {{ship|HMHS|Britannic||2}} which received a full complement of lifeboats all rigged under davits. This difference would have been a major contributor to the high loss of life involved with ''Lusitania''{{'}}s sinking, since there was not sufficient time to assemble collapsible boats or life-rafts, had it not been for the fact that the ship's severe listing made it impossible for lifeboats on the port side of the vessel to be lowered, and the rapidity of the sinking did not allow the remaining lifeboats that could be directly lowered (as these were rigged under davits) to be filled and launched with passengers. When ''Britannic'', working as a hospital ship during [[World War I]], sank in 1916 after hitting a mine in the Kea channel the already davited boats were swiftly lowered saving nearly all on board, but the ship took nearly three times as long to sink as ''Lusitania'' and thus the crew had more time to evacuate passengers.\n\n==Early career (1906\u20131914)==\n[[File:Launch Party - Mauretania.jpg|thumb|left|''Mauretania''{{'}}s official launch party, 20 September 1906]]\n[[File:Mauretania.jpg|thumb|''Mauretania'' on 17 September 1907 approaching the mouth of the [[River Tyne]] and the open sea]]\n[[File:Mauretania cutaway view.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of ''Mauretania'']]\n''Mauretania'' departed [[Liverpool]] on her [[maiden voyage]] on 16 November 1907 under the command of Captain John Pritchard, and on the return voyage (30 November\u20135 December 1907) captured the record for the fastest eastbound crossing of the Atlantic,<ref name=cross41/> with an average speed of {{convert|23.69|kn}}.<ref name=cross41/> On 23 December 1907, ''Mauretania'' was again at New York City and moored to Pier 54 in the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] when a [[squall]] with high winds struck, causing mooring posts on Pier 54 to give way. ''Mauretania'' went partially adrift, and her [[Bow (ship)|bow]] swung around and struck several [[barge]]s which were bringing her coal and taking off ashes; the barges ''Roan'' and ''Tomhicken'' and the boats ''Eureka 32'' and ''Eureka 36'' were damaged and the barge ''Ellis P.

Published by Patrick Stephens, 1970 (p. 207).</ref> until the end of the war,<ref name=tynewar/> but the vessel's name was never changed by Cunard. Starting in March 1918, ''Mauretania'' received two forms of [[dazzle camouflage]], a type of abstract colour scheming designed by [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] in 1917 in an effort to confuse enemy ships. The first camouflage scheme, applied early in March 1918, was curvilinear in nature and largely broad areas of olive with blacks, greys and blues. The second scheme was the more geometric design commonly referred to as \"dazzle\"; this design, applied by July 1918, was mostly several dark blues and greys with some black. After her war service, she was repainted in a drab grey scheme and finally full Cunard livery by the middle of 1919.\n\n==Post-war career (1919\u20131934)==\n[[File:Verandah Caf\u00e9 - Mauretania.jpg|thumb|left|Verandah Caf\u00e9 on the boat deck.]]''Mauretania'' returned to civilian service on 21 September 1919.

[[Cunard Line|Cunard]] noticed that ''Mauretania'' struggled to maintain her regular Atlantic service speed. Although the ship's service speed had improved and it now burned only {{convert|750|ST}} of oil per 24 hours, compared to {{convert|1000|ST}} of coal previously, it was not operating at her pre-war service speeds.

Cunard decided that the ship's once revolutionary turbines were in desperate need of an overhaul.<ref name=tynefinal/> In 1923, a major refitting was begun in Southampton. ''Mauretania''{{'}}s turbines were dismantled. Halfway through the overhaul, the shipyard workers went on strike and the work was halted, so Cunard had the ship towed to [[Cherbourg]], France, where the work was completed at another shipyard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectionsprojects.org.uk/mauretania/story-final.html|title=Mauretania|website=collectionsprojects.org.uk}}</ref> In May 1924, the ship returned to Atlantic service.<ref name=tynefinal/>\n\n[[File:RMS Mauretania Second Class Smoking Room.jpg|thumb|left|''Mauretania''{{'}}s Second Class Smoking Room.]]\nIn 1928 ''Mauretania'' was refurbished with a new interior design and in the next year her speed record was broken by a German liner, {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}},<ref name=maxtone255>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 255.</ref> with a speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. On 27 August, [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] permitted the former ocean greyhound to have one final attempt to recapture the record from the newer German liner. She was taken out of service and her engines were adjusted to produce more power to give a higher service speed; however, this was still not enough.

Peskett's original configuration for the ships in 1902 was a three-funnel design, when reciprocating engines were destined to be the powerplant. A giant model of the ships appeared in ''Shipbuilder's'' magazine in this configuration. Cunard decided to change power plants to Parson's new turbine technology, and the ship's design was again modified when Peskett added a fourth funnel to the ship's profile. Construction of the vessel finally began with the laying of the keel in August 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectionsprojects.org.uk/mauretania/story-construction.html|title=Mauretania|website=collectionsprojects.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1906, ''Mauretania'' was launched by the [[Anne Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe|Duchess of Roxburghe]].<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 25.</ref> At the time of her launch, she was the largest moving structure ever built,<ref name=tynestart>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/mauretania/story-construction.html|title=RMS Mauretania Construction|publisher=Tyne and Wear Archives Service|accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref> and slightly larger in gross tonnage than ''Lusitania''. The main visual differences between ''Mauretania'' and ''Lusitania'' were that ''Mauretania'' was five feet longer and had different vents.<ref>Layton 2007, p. 44.</ref> ''Mauretania'' also had two extra stages of turbine blades in her forward turbines, making her slightly faster than ''Lusitania''. ''Mauretania'' and ''Lusitania'' were the only ships with direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s to hold the Blue Riband; in later ships, reduction-geared turbines were mainly used.<ref>Williams, Trevor. (1982) A short history of twentieth-century technology.

The ship's interior was designed by [[Harold Peto]], architect, and her public rooms were fitted out by two notable London design houses \u2013 Ch. Mellier & Sons and Turner and Lord,<ref name=tynefit>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tyneandweararchives.org.uk/mauretania/story-fitting%20out.html|title=RMS Mauretania Fitting Out|publisher=Tyne and Wear Archives Service|accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref><ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 31.</ref> with twenty-eight different types of wood, along with marble, tapestries, and other furnishings such as the stunning octagon table in the smoking room.<ref name=tynefit/><ref name=maxtone33>Maxtone-Graham 1972, pp. 33\u201336.</ref> Wood panelling for her first class public rooms was supposedly carved by three hundred craftsmen from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] but this seems unlikely, unnecessary and was probably executed by the yard or subcontracted, as were the majority of the second and third class areas.<ref>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 33.</ref> The multi-level first-class dining saloon of straw oak was decorated in [[Francis I style]] and topped by a large dome [[skylight (window)|skylight]].<ref name=maxtone33/> A series of elevators, then a rare new feature for liners, with grilles composed of the relatively new lightweight aluminum, were installed next to ''Mauretania''{{'}}s walnut grand staircase.<ref name=maxtone33/> A new feature was the Verandah Caf\u00e9 on the boat deck, where passengers were served beverages in a weather-protected environment, although this was enclosed within a year as it proved unrealistic.<ref name=tynefit/>\n\n==Comparison with the ''Olympic'' class==\nThe [[White Star Line]]'s {{sclass-|Olympic|ocean liner|0}} vessels were almost {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} longer and slightly wider than ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''. This made the White Star vessels about 15,000 [[gross register tonnage|gross register tons]] larger than the Cunard vessels. Both ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' were launched and had been in service for several years before ''Olympic'', ''Titanic'' and ''Britannic'' were ready for the North Atlantic run. Although significantly faster than the ''Olympic'' class would be, the speed and port turnaround times of Cunard's vessels was not sufficient to allow the line to run a weekly two-ship transatlantic service from each side of the Atlantic. A third ship was needed for a weekly service, and in response to White Star's announced plan to build the three ''Olympic''-class ships, Cunard ordered a third ship: {{RMS|Aquitania|3=2}}. Like {{RMS|Olympic||2}}, Cunard's ''Aquitania'' had a lower service speed, but was a larger and more luxurious vessel.\n\nBecause of their increased size the ''Olympic''-class liners could offer many more amenities than ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''. Both ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' offered swimming pools, [[Turkish bath]]s, a gymnasium, a [[squash court]], large reception rooms, \u00c0 la Carte restaurants separate from the dining saloons, and many more staterooms with private bathroom facilities than their two Cunard rivals.\n\nHeavy vibrations as a by-product of the four [[steam turbine]]s on ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' plagued both ships throughout their careers. When ''Lusitania'' sailed at top speed the vibrations were so severe that Second and Third Class sections of the ship could become uninhabitable.<ref>Archibald, Rick & Ballard, Robert.''The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard,'' Thunder Bay Press: 2005; p. 46.</ref> In contrast, the ''Olympic''-class liners utilized two traditional [[reciprocating engine]]s and only one turbine for the central propeller, which greatly reduced vibration. Because of their greater tonnage and wider beam, the ''Olympic''-class liners were also more stable at sea and less prone to rolling. ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' both featured straight prows in contrast to the angled prows of the ''Olympic'' liners. Designed so that the ships could plunge through a wave rather than crest it, the unforeseen consequence was that the Cunard liners would pitch forward alarmingly, even in calm weather, allowing huge waves to splash the bow and forward part of the superstructure.<ref>Archibald, Rick & Ballard, Robert.\"The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard,\" Thunder Bay Press: 2005; pp. 51-52.</ref>\n\n[[File:RMS Olympic & RMS Mauretania.jpg|thumb|White Star's ''Olympic'' (foreground) and Cunard's ''Mauretania'' (background)]]\nThe vessels of the ''Olympic'' class also differed from ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' in the way in which they were compartmented below the waterline. The White Star vessels were divided by transverse watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]]. While ''Lusitania'' also had transverse bulkheads, it also had longitudinal bulkheads running along the ship on each side, between the boiler and engine rooms and the coal bunkers on the outside of the vessel. The British commission that had investigated the sinking of {{RMS|Titanic||2}} in 1912 heard testimony on the flooding of coal bunkers lying outside longitudinal bulkheads. Being of considerable length, when flooded, these could increase the ship's list and \"make the lowering of the boats on the other side impracticable\"{{sfn|Titanic Inquiry}} \u2014 and this was precisely what later happened with ''Lusitania''. Furthermore, the ship's [[ship stability|stability]] was insufficient for the bulkhead arrangement used: flooding of only three coal bunkers on one side could result in negative [[metacentric height]].{{sfn|Layton|2010|page=55}} On the other hand, ''Titanic'' was given ample stability and sank with only a few degrees list, the design being such that there was very little risk of unequal flooding and possible capsize.{{sfn|Hackett|Bedford|1996|page=171}}\n\n''Lusitania'' did not carry enough lifeboats for all her passengers, officers and crew on board at the time of her maiden voyage (actually carrying four lifeboats fewer than ''Titanic'' would carry in 1912). This was a common practice for large passenger ships at the time, since the belief was that in busy shipping lanes help would always be nearby and the few boats available would be adequate to ferry all aboard to rescue ships before a sinking. After ''Titanic'' sank, ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'' would be equipped with only an additional six more [[clinker (boat building)|clinker-built]] wooden boats under [[davit]]s, making for a total of 22 boats rigged in davits. The rest of their lifeboat accommodations were supplemented with 26 collapsible lifeboats, 18 stored directly beneath the regular lifeboats and eight on the after deck. The collapsibles were built with hollow wooden bottoms and canvas sides, and needed assembly in the event they had to be used.{{sfn|Simpson|1972|page=159}}\n\nThis contrasted with ''Olympic'' and {{ship|HMHS|Britannic||2}} which received a full complement of lifeboats all rigged under davits. This difference would have been a major contributor to the high loss of life involved with ''Lusitania''{{'}}s sinking, since there was not sufficient time to assemble collapsible boats or life-rafts, had it not been for the fact that the ship's severe listing made it impossible for lifeboats on the port side of the vessel to be lowered, and the rapidity of the sinking did not allow the remaining lifeboats that could be directly lowered (as these were rigged under davits) to be filled and launched with passengers. When ''Britannic'', working as a hospital ship during [[World War I]], sank in 1916 after hitting a mine in the Kea channel the already davited boats were swiftly lowered saving nearly all on board, but the ship took nearly three times as long to sink as ''Lusitania'' and thus the crew had more time to evacuate passengers.\n\n==Early career (1906\u20131914)==\n[[File:Launch Party - Mauretania.jpg|thumb|left|''Mauretania''{{'}}s official launch party, 20 September 1906]]\n[[File:Mauretania.jpg|thumb|''Mauretania'' on 17 September 1907 approaching the mouth of the [[River Tyne]] and the open sea]]\n[[File:Mauretania cutaway view.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of ''Mauretania'']]\n''Mauretania'' departed [[Liverpool]] on her [[maiden voyage]] on 16 November 1907 under the command of Captain John Pritchard, and on the return voyage (30 November\u20135 December 1907) captured the record for the fastest eastbound crossing of the Atlantic,<ref name=cross41/> with an average speed of {{convert|23.69|kn}}.<ref name=cross41/> On 23 December 1907, ''Mauretania'' was again at New York City and moored to Pier 54 in the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] when a [[squall]] with high winds struck, causing mooring posts on Pier 54 to give way.

Published by Patrick Stephens, 1970 (p. 207).</ref> until the end of the war,<ref name=tynewar/> but the vessel's name was never changed by Cunard. Starting in March 1918, ''Mauretania'' received two forms of [[dazzle camouflage]], a type of abstract colour scheming designed by [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] in 1917 in an effort to confuse enemy ships. The first camouflage scheme, applied early in March 1918, was curvilinear in nature and largely broad areas of olive with blacks, greys and blues. The second scheme was the more geometric design commonly referred to as \"dazzle\"; this design, applied by July 1918, was mostly several dark blues and greys with some black. After her war service, she was repainted in a drab grey scheme and finally full Cunard livery by the middle of 1919.\n\n==Post-war career (1919\u20131934)==\n[[File:Verandah Caf\u00e9 - Mauretania.jpg|thumb|left|Verandah Caf\u00e9 on the boat deck.]]''Mauretania'' returned to civilian service on 21 September 1919.

[[Cunard Line|Cunard]] noticed that ''Mauretania'' struggled to maintain her regular Atlantic service speed. Although the ship's service speed had improved and it now burned only {{convert|750|ST}} of oil per 24 hours, compared to {{convert|1000|ST}} of coal previously, it was not operating at her pre-war service speeds. On one crossing in 1922 the ship managed an average speed of only {{convert|19|kn}}. It was during these years her promenade was enclosed. Cunard decided that the ship's once revolutionary turbines were in desperate need of an overhaul.<ref name=tynefinal/> In 1923, a major refitting was begun in Southampton. ''Mauretania''{{'}}s turbines were dismantled. Halfway through the overhaul, the shipyard workers went on strike and the work was halted, so Cunard had the ship towed to [[Cherbourg]], France, where the work was completed at another shipyard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectionsprojects.org.uk/mauretania/story-final.html|title=Mauretania|website=collectionsprojects.org.uk}}</ref> In May 1924, the ship returned to Atlantic service.<ref name=tynefinal/>\n\n[[File:RMS Mauretania Second Class Smoking Room.jpg|thumb|left|''Mauretania''{{'}}s Second Class Smoking Room.]]\nIn 1928 ''Mauretania'' was refurbished with a new interior design and in the next year her speed record was broken by a German liner, {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}},<ref name=maxtone255>Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 255.</ref> with a speed of {{convert|28|kn}}. On 27 August, [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] permitted the former ocean greyhound to have one final attempt to recapture the record from the newer German liner. She was taken out of service and her engines were adjusted to produce more power to give a higher service speed; however, this was still not enough. ''Bremen'' simply represented a new generation of ocean liners that were far more powerful and technologically advanced than the aging Cunard liner.<ref name=maxtone255/> Even though ''Mauretania'' did not beat her German rival, the ship lost by just a fraction after decades of design improvement and beat all her own previous speed records both east and westbound. In 1929 ''Mauretania'' collided with a train ferry near [[Robbins Reef Light]].

Consequently new radiometric units for [[radiation protection]] were defined which took this into account.  In 1953 the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) recommended the rad, equal to 100 erg/g, as the unit of measure of the new radiation quantity [[absorbed dose]].

One Gray is equal to 1 joule/kg (i.e. 100 rad). Additionally, a new quantity, [[Kerma (physics)|Kerma]], was defined for air ionisation as the exposure quantity for instrument calibration, and from this the [[absorbed dose]] can be calculated using known coefficients for specific target materials.

As the science of radiation dosimetry developed, this was seen as a serious shortcoming.\n\nIn 1940, Louis Harold Gray, who had been studying the effect of neutron damage on human tissue, together with [[William Valentine Mayneord]] and the radiobiologist John Read, published a paper in which a unit of measure, dubbed the \"''gram roentgen''\" (symbol: gr) defined as \"that amount of neutron radiation which produces an increment in energy in unit volume of tissue equal to the increment of energy produced in unit volume of water by one roentgen of radiation\"<ref name=\"Gupta2009\">{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=S.

This body, initially known as the \"Commission for the System of Units\", renamed in 1964 as the \"Consultative Committee for Units\" (CCU), was responsible for overseeing the development of the [[International System of Units]] (SI).<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/ccu/\n|title = CCU: Consultative Committee for Units\n|publisher = [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM)\n|accessdate = 2012-05-18}}</ref> At the same time it was becoming increasingly obvious that the definition of the roentgen was unsound, and in 1962 it was redefined.<ref>{{cite book\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IEhJpyEBKYIC&pg=PA554&lpg=PA554&dq=roentgen+1925+1937+1962+ionisation#v=onepage&q=roentgen%201925%201937%201962%20ionisation&f=false\n|title = The Dental Assistant\n|first1 = Pauline C\n|last1 = Anderson\n|first2 = Alice E\n|last2 = Pendleton\n|edition = 7th\n|isbn = 0-7668-1113-1\n|publisher = Delmar\n|chapter = 14 Dental Radiography\n|page = 554|year = 2000\n}}</ref>\nThe CCU decided to define the SI unit of absorbed radiation in terms of energy per unit mass, which in MKS units was J/kg.

The definition of the roentgen had had the attraction of being relatively simple to define for photons in air, but the gray is independent of the primary ionizing radiation type, and can be used for both kerma and absorbed dose in a wide range of matter.<ref name=Lovell3>{{cite book\n|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lK48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=roentgen+defined#v=onepage&q=roentgen%20defined&f=false\n|title = An introduction to Radiation Dosimetry\n|first1 = S\n|last1 = Lovell\n|year = 1979\n|chapter = 3.

The protagonist is Julia Martin, Rhys's fictional counterpart. Julia's three romantic figures Rhys calls \"Mr\" (Mr Mackenzie, Mr Horsfield and Mr James).\n\nThe title is a reversal of premise: Mr Mackenzie has left Julia Martin rather than vice-versa.

Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face [[Duel|with her glove]] and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after exiting Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quay des Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel. Julia read most of the time.

The protagonist is Julia Martin, Rhys's fictional counterpart. Julia's three romantic figures Rhys calls \"Mr\" (Mr Mackenzie, Mr Horsfield and Mr James).\n\nThe title is a reversal of premise: Mr Mackenzie has left Julia Martin rather than vice-versa. Themes include the lot of the outsider, the plight of the underdog, rich versus poor, female alienation, loneliness, destitution, death, grief, nostalgia for childhood and the quest for love.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellown|first=Elgin W.|date=1972|title=Character and Themes in the Novels of Jean Rhys|journal=Contemporary Literature|volume=13|issue=4|pages=458\u2013475|doi=10.2307/1207442|jstor=1207442|issn=0010-7484}}</ref> The novel is in three parts''',''' each subdivided into numbered, titled chapters.\n\n== Plot ==\n'''Part One''' \n\nFrom her cheap hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, Julia Martin inhabits ''[[Rive Gauche]]'' Paris, lunching alone in a German restaurant in the [[rue de la Huchette]], drinking [[Pernod Ricard|Pernod]], wine and anything else. Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face [[Duel|with her glove]] and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after leaving Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quay des Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel. Julia read most of the time.

It is terrible, but it is superb.\"<ref>West, Rebecca, ''The Pursuit of Misery in Some New Novels'', Books of the Day, The Daily Telegraph, 30 January 1931, 7</ref>\n\n[[Gerald Gould]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' called the novel: \"A hard, clean, dry, desperate book, so rigid in its economy that its impressiveness seems almost contemptuous.\" Deeming it not a \"pleasant\" novel, Gould wrote \"it has more important merits.\" He concluded: \"Of its kind, and within its limits, this book is a flawless work of art.\"<ref>Gould, Gerald, ''All Sorts of Societies'', New Novels, The Observer 7289, 8 February 1931</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis|title=The mirror image: The representation of social roles for women in novels by Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton and Jean Rhys|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/nl/publications/the-mirror-image(843bf106-13d1-4fb0-b3e0-146f6b1fd32d).html|publisher=University of Groningen|date=2011|language=English|first=G.

It is no defect in the work\". Impressed by the economy of Rhys's style, he added: \"Julia\u2019s existence and the existence of those with whom she came in contact are somehow made meaningful by these very meaningless odds and ends of observation.\"<ref>Stone, Geoffrey, ''Bookman'', 74, New York, September 1931, 84</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[Carole Angier|Angier, Carole]], ''Jean Rhys: Life and Work'', London, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, 1990\n* Pizzichini, Lilian, ''The Blue Hour: A Life of Jean Rhys'', New York, W.

({{lang-de|Duala}}) is the largest city in [[Cameroon]] and its ecpital. It is also the capital of Cameroon's [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral Region]].

Consequently, it handles most of the country's major exports, such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]], timber, metals and fruits. As from 2018, the city and its surrounding area had an estimated population of 2,768,400.<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Cameroon-Cities.html</ref> The city sits on the estuary of [[Wouri River]] and its climate is [[tropical]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Douala|History of Cameroon|Kamerun}}\n\nThe first [[Europe]]ans to visit the area were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in about 1472. At the time, the estuary of [[Wouri River]] was known as the Rio dos Camar\u00f5es (Shrimp River). By 1650, it had become the site of a town formed by immigrants, said to have arrived from Congo, who spoke the [[Duala language]]. During the 18th century it was the center of the [[transatlantic slave trade]].\n\nIn 1826<ref>Notes from Richard Mother Jackson published in R.-P. Bouchaud 1948 and 1952.</ref> Douala appeared to be made of four different villages located in four specific locations: the village of Deido (Dido), of Akwa, of Njo and Hickory-town (today Bonaberi, located on the other side of Wouri River).\n\n[[File:SMS OLGA bei der Beschie\u00dfung von Hickorytown (Duala), Kamerun, Dezember 1884.jpg|thumb|The German corvette {{SMS|Olga}} at the bombardment of Hickorytown, Cameroon (today Duala) on December 21, 1884]]\nBetween 1884 and 1895 the city was a German protectorate.<ref> Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Douala Douala], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>\nThe colonial politics focused on commerce and some exploration of the unoccupied territories. In 1885, [[Alfred Saker]] organized the first mission of the British Baptist Church. In the same year the city known as Kamerun was renamed Douala and became the capital of the territory until 1902, when the capital was moved to [[Bu\u00e9a]].\n\nIn 1907 the Ministry of Colonies was established and Douala had 23,000 citizens.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\">Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le (2010). ''Suites architecturales: Kinshasa, Douala, Dakar''. \u00c9pinal: Association VAA, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] in 1919, the German colonial territories became French and British protectorates. France received a mandate to administer Douala. A treaty was signed with the local chiefs.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1946, it was the capital of Cameroon.<ref> Mark Dike DeLancey, Mark W. Delancey, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2019, p. 176</ref> In 1955 the city had over 100,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn 1960 Cameroon became independent and it became a federal republic, with its capital in [[Yaound\u00e9]]. Douala became the major economic city. In 1972 the federal republic became a unified state. Douala then had a population of around 500,000.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, in Cameroon the struggle for liberalization and [[Multi-party system|multi-partitism]] grew. Between May and December 1991, Douala was at the center of the civil disobedience campaign called the ghost town operation (''ville morte'') during which economic activities shut down to make the country ungovernable and to force the government to allow multi-partitism and freedom of expression.<ref>Edmond Kamguia Koumchou (2003), ''Le Journalisme du Carton Rouge''.

It was renamed Douala in 1907 after the name of the natives known as Dua ala Ijaws (Njos), and became part of French Cameroon in 1919.

Akwa is Douala's business district and Bonanjo its administrative district. ''Plateau Joss'' is the name used historically for the current district of Akwa. The name of the districts refer to the Douala lineage, as well as the neighborhoods. For example, Akwa was historically divided between Bell and Deido into Bonadibong, Bonamilengue, Boneleke, Bonalembe, Bonejang, Bonamuti, Bonabekombo, Bonaboijan, and Bonakuamuang; the prefix \"bona\" means \"descendant of\".\n* [[Ball, Douala|Bali]], housing area located near Bonanjo administrative area.\n* [[B\u00e9panda]] is a very densely populated  neighbourhood. It is probably the most inhabited area of the city with lots of inhabitants coming from West Africa and from all parts of the country. The seat of the University of Douala and an important telecommunication centre of the Cameroon telecommunications are located there.\n* [[Deido]] is a historical neighbourhood located in the north central part of the city. It includes one of the main junctions of the city known as Le Rond-Point De\u00efdo and the symbol of the city \u201cthe Njounjou\u201d (\u201cthe monster\u201d).\n* [[Bonaberi]] is located on the right of Wouri River. It is primarily an industrial neighborhood but is gradually becoming a mixed area including more residential and commercial areas. It is connected by the two only bridges of the city. It is also the main opening toward the western anglophone area of the country.\n* [[Bonapriso]] is one of the wealthiest area of the city and even of the country. Historically a residential neighbourhood, it has become a mixed area including  commercial galleries, restaurants and shops.\n* [[Bonanjo]] is the administrative neighborhood, with many large administrations, larger companies and banks offices, with higher buildings than the rest of the city\n* [[Bonamoussadi]] is the main housing area located in the northern part of the city. In a first time very residential, it has recently witnessed a significant surge in the installation of malls, supermarkets, restaurants and even night clubs.\n* [[Kotto, Douala|Kotto]] is a modern residential neighbourhood next to Bonamoussadi. It developed in the early 1980s with the housing projects of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re du Cameroun (SIC) and is now the prime area for the small but increasing  middle and upper classes of the city.\n* [[New Bell, Douala|New Bell]] is an historical neighbourhood of the city. It was founded in the early 20th century with the expropriation by the Germans of the natives Duala people from the plateau Joss. It is known for housing since then newcomers in the city from all parts of the country and even from abroad (mainly west Africa). It today a very populous neighbourhood with very tough conditions. Two of the main markets of the city (Central market and March\u00e9 Nkololoun) are in the area.\n* [[Bassa, Douala|Bassa]] is a vast area in the eastern part of the city. It is a mixed area including  many neighborhoods (some wealthier than others) such as Logbaba, Ndogpassi, Cit\u00e9 des Palmiers, PK 8 and many others. It also includes one of the two major industrial zones of the city (the other being in Bonaberi).\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Ars&Urbis International Workshop - Emiliano Gandolfi 176.JPG|300px|thumb|right|[[Palace of the Kings Bell]]]]\nAccording to Jacques Soulillou,<ref>Jacques Soulillou (1989), ''Douala, un si\u00e8cle en images''. Paris: L'Harmattan, p. 9.</ref> historical images of Douala document the areas of Akwa (Plateau Joss) and the port between 1860 and 1960, while the districts of Bonaberi, Deido and New Bell have almost no images. The archives which provide documentation about the city are based in Paris,<ref>French national archives, Section Outre-mer and D\u00e9partment des Estampes; Documentation Fran\u00e7ais, Phototh\u00e8que Afrique; Archives des P\u00e8res du Saint-Esprit; Archives des Missions des \u00c9glises \u00c9vangeliques; Agence France Press.</ref> Basel,<ref>Archives of Mission 21.</ref> Hamburg,<ref>Welwirtschafsvelten; Deutsch Afrika Linien.</ref> Potsdam,<ref>Staatliche Archivverwaltung.</ref> Douala<ref>Archive Photo Prunet.</ref> and Yaound\u00e9.<ref>Goethe Institut.</ref>\n\nIn 1896 a first urban plan of the city was developed during the German colonial period. The plan included a [[Former general Hospital of Douala|hospital]], the [[Old German government headquarters in Douala|governor residency]], the palace of justice, the [[Former police station of Douala|police station]], administrative buildings and buildings for the port and customs (among those the [[Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House in Douala|Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House]]). The [[Bonakouamouang Chimney]] also dates back to this period. In 1904 construction of the [[Villa Mandessi Bell]] was begun. In 1905 the [[Palace of the Kings Bell|palace of the King Manga Ndumbe Bell]] (also called la Pagode) was built, and in 1906 the general plan of Gross Douala was established. In 1914 the large population living in Bonanjo was moved to the new estate of Neue Bell (New Bell).\n\nBetween 1925 and 1930, during the French colonial period, the [[Chamber of Commerce (Douala 1927-1928)|chamber of commerce]], the [[Former palace of Justice of Douala|new palace of justice]], the new railway station, the [[vault of the Kings Bell]] and the catholic [[Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, Douala|cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul]] were built. Constructions were intensified between 1930 and 1955 and in 1955 the bridge on Wouri River was built. In 1935 the [[Mausoleum of the Kings Akwa]] was constructed. In 1947 the [[Temple of the Centenary in Douala|Temple of the Centenary]] was built. In 1959 a new city plan was designed (Plan Dorian); according to Dani\u00e8le Diwouta-Kotto,<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> this plan is still influencing Douala's urban development. After the independence of 1960 a new development and urban plan were established. In 1998 a research prepared the diagnostic for the 2015 horizon. In 2005 a new development and urban plan was designed and routes and public canalizations were reestablished and created. In the same year the Project Sawa-Beach was  launched. Since 1888, terracotta bricks have been  produced in Douala.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nThe publication ''Suites architecturales''<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> focuses on heritage and reappropriation in the architecture of Douala, and it presents some of the characteristics of the buildings and architecture of Douala after its independence. Among those buildings are the casino, the show-room La Meublerie, the exhibition hall Cami-Toyota, [[Union Bank of Cameroon]], Immeuble Hollando, the Baptist church, Immeuble Victoria, headquarters of CA-SCB, [[doual'art|espace doual'art]], and Orange Flagship. The [[Palace Dika Akwa Mukanda]] was built in 1990.\n\nAlong the city's main thoroughfare lie some of Cameroon's best restaurants, coffee houses and French-style [[patisserie]]s; along the waterfront, many bars and bistros may be found, commanding views of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and nearby [[mangrove]] swamps.  Many of these are frequented by the city's large [[expatriate]] population, mainly French or Lebanese, most of whom work in the [[petroleum industry]].\n\n== Culture ==\n* [[Douala Maritime Museum]], Museum showcasing the rich maritime history of Douala. The building is shaped like a boat (however the museum only occupy 400 m2 of the building). It is located in the administrative area [[Bonanjo]]\n* [[Doual'art]], an art gallery/center\n* [[La Nouvelle Libert\u00e9]], a 12m piece from [[Joseph Francis Sum\u00e9gn\u00e9]] inaugurated in 2007. A permanent monumental sculpture made with recycled material located at a main roundabout in Douala. It is 12 meters high with a wingspan of 5 meters.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Douala]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Evangelical Church of Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Presbyterian Church in Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Union of Baptist Churches in Cameroon]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Integrity for All]] ([[Christian Missionary Fellowship and Associated Churches]]), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon ([[Assemblies of God]]).<ref> J.

In recent years there has been a surge in the number of private schools. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It is interesting to note that there is also a large, informal educational sector that caters to a huge part of the population, mostly individuals with a primary school certificate or those with no education at all. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} This form of education is common in sectors like cloth manufacturing, bread making, construction, security, and car repairing. Individuals from these informal sectors are by far the most visibly deprived in neighborhoods such as Ndokoti, Bepanda, Village, Logbaba.\n\nThe city of Douala is home to a number of higher education institutions, including the [[University of Douala]].<ref>Presidential act n\u00b0 93/030 of 19 January 1993.</ref>There are also a number of professional schools, the most prominent one being the Douala Maritime institute. Douala has an [[aviation school]] called [[CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Gare de Bessengu\u00e9 2.JPG|thumb|Gare de Bessengu\u00e9, Douala's train station]]\nDouala is linked by [[Camrail|rail]] to [[Yaound\u00e9]], [[Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9]], [[Kumba]] and [[Nkongsamba]]. Douala has a fairly developed road network compared to other cities in Cameroon. However many of the city's roads have decayed due to years of neglect and corruption. Efforts have recently been made to renovate the city's roads, especially in the most deprived neighborhoods. In spite of the numerous domestic and international investments, the roads remain in deplorable state largely due to embezzlement and corruption. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[tram]] network is planned for Douala, with the first line projected to open in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/douala-tram-project-poised-to-launch.html|title=Douala tram project poised to launch|date=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Douala International Airport]] is located in the eastern part of the city. There are direct flights to several European cities, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and [[Istanbul]]. Regional and continental destinations include [[Abidjan]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Dakar]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Kinshasa]], [[Lagos]], [[Malabo]], and [[Nairobi]]. The airport is the busiest in the [[CEMAC]] area and is the hub for Cameroon's national carrier, Camairco. The airport is in dire need of renovations due to poor circulation and old infrastructure.\n\nThe [[seaport]] has {{convert|8.5|m|abbr=off}} of [[Draft (ship)|draft]].\n\n== Economy ==\nDouala is a city with a modest oil resource in Africa, but is in excellent agricultural condition, therefore it has one of best economies in Africa. However, it also faces some problems like other underdeveloped countries such as heavy civil service and bad climate (flood, tornado, storm) to business.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nMain economic parameters are:\n\n*'''GDP:''' $42.2 billion (2006 est.):\n* '''GDP growth rate''': 4.1% (2006 est.)\n* '''Exports-partners''': Spain 17.3%, Italy 13.8%, France 9.5%, South Korea 8.1%, UK 8.1%, Netherlands 7.9%, Belgium 4.9%, US 4.3% (2005)\n*'''Imports - partners''': France 21%, Nigeria 15%, Belgium 6.3%, China 5.6%, US 5.1%, Thailand 4.5%, Germany 4.2% (2005)\n\n=== Wealth and poverty ===\nEven though Douala is the economic center of Cameroon, a large percentage of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. Recent data shows that about thirty percent of the population lives in poverty (Avameg, Inc). While the aforementioned percentage is doubled for rural regions, poverty is a growing problem for Douala due to its steadily increasing population. Unlike the rural populations of Cameroon that can grow their own foods to lessen their expenses, Douala locals are disadvantaged by living in the port city where there are not many opportunities for monetary gain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Cameroon.html|title=Cameroon|website=www.nationsencyclopedia.com|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== People ==\n* [[Louis Brody]] (1892\u20131951), German actor\n* Prince [[Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell]] (1927\u20132012), chief of Douala<ref>{{cite web|title=Cameroun : qui \u00e9tait Son Altesse Royale le Prince Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell ?|url=http://www.afrik.com/cameroun-qui-etait-son-altesse-royale-le-prince-rene-douala-manga-bell|website=afrik.com|language=fr|date=4 January 2013}}.</ref> \n* [[Francis Bebey]] (1929\u20132002), author \n* [[Manu Dibango]] (1933\u20132020), musician, saxophonist and singer, world jazz, ethno-jazz.\n* [[Jean-Pierre Dikongu\u00e9 Pipa]] (1940\u2013), cineast\n* [[Patrick Baudry]] (1946\u2013), second French [[astronaut]] and first astronaut of an African country\n* [[Nton\u00e8 Nton\u00e8 Fritz]] (1954\u2013), politician\n* [[\u00c9lise Mballa]] (1961\u2013), dancer\n* [[Maka Kotto]] (1961\u2013), Canadian politician\n* [[Ang\u00e8le Etoundi Essamba]] (1962\u2013), photograph\n* [[Petit Pays]] (1967\u2013), singer, dancer, author\n* [[Blaise Bang]] (1968\u2013), artist\n* [[Hemley Boum]] (1973\u2013), writer\n* [[Achillek\u00e0 Komguem]] (1973\u2013), artist\n* [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pierre Wom\u00e9]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Killamel]] (1984\u2013), rap dancer\n* [[V\u00e9ronique Mang]] (1984\u2013), sport\n* Vital Mevengue (1978\u2014)\n* [[Paul-Georges Ntep]] (1992\u2013), footballer\n* [[Samuel Eto'o]] (1981\u2013), footballer\n* [[Narcisse Mouelle Kombi]](1962\u2013 ), writer and politician\n* [[Christian Ngan]] (1983\u2013 ), entrepreneur, business man and financier\n* [[Marc Kibong Mbamba]] (1988\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pascal Siakam]] (1994\u2013 ), basketball player - 2019 NBA Champion\n* [[Ibrahim Amadou]] (1993\u2013), footballer\n* [[Fidele Ntie-Kang]] (1976-), chemist\n* [[Elsa Kwin]], singer and competitor on [[The Voice Afrique Francophone]]\n* [[Kareyce Fotso]] (2010-), Cameroonian singer\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nDoula is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Strasbourg]], France\n*{{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Akhisar]], Turkey\n*{{flagicon|Senegal}} [[Dakar]], Senegal\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], United States\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Philadelphia]], United States\n*{{flagicon|Namibia}} [[Windhoek]],  Namibia\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of colonial governors of Cameroon]]\n* [[Timeline of Douala]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{See also|Timeline of Douala#Bibliography|l1=Bibliography of the history of Douala}}\n* {{in lang|en}} Brooke, James (1987). \"Informal Capitalism Grows in Cameroon.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

It is also the capital of Cameroon's [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral Region]]. Home to Central Africa's largest [[port]] and its major international airport, [[Douala International Airport]] (DLA), it is the commercial and economic capital of Cameroon and the entire [[Economic Community of Central African States|CEMAC]] region comprising Gabon, Congo, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Cameroon. Consequently, it handles most of the country's major exports, such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]], timber, metals and fruits. As from 2018, the city and its surrounding area had an estimated population of 2,768,400.<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Cameroon-Cities.html</ref> The city sits on the estuary of [[Wouri River]] and its climate is [[tropical]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Douala|History of Cameroon|Kamerun}}\n\nThe first [[Europe]]ans to visit the area were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in about 1472. At the time, the estuary of [[Wouri River]] was known as the Rio dos Camar\u00f5es (Shrimp River). By 1650, it had become the site of a town formed by immigrants, said to have arrived from Congo, who spoke the [[Duala language]]. During the 18th century it was the center of the [[transatlantic slave trade]].\n\nIn 1826<ref>Notes from Richard Mother Jackson published in R.-P. Bouchaud 1948 and 1952.</ref> Douala appeared to be made of four different villages located in four specific locations: the village of Deido (Dido), of Akwa, of Njo and Hickory-town (today Bonaberi, located on the other side of Wouri River).\n\n[[File:SMS OLGA bei der Beschie\u00dfung von Hickorytown (Duala), Kamerun, Dezember 1884.jpg|thumb|The German corvette {{SMS|Olga}} at the bombardment of Hickorytown, Cameroon (today Duala) on December 21, 1884]]\nBetween 1884 and 1895 the city was a German protectorate.<ref> Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Douala Douala], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>\nThe colonial politics focused on commerce and some exploration of the unoccupied territories. In 1885, [[Alfred Saker]] organized the first mission of the British Baptist Church. In the same year the city known as Kamerun was renamed Douala and became the capital of the territory until 1902, when the capital was moved to [[Bu\u00e9a]].\n\nIn 1907 the Ministry of Colonies was established and Douala had 23,000 citizens.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\">Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le (2010). ''Suites architecturales: Kinshasa, Douala, Dakar''. \u00c9pinal: Association VAA, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] in 1919, the German colonial territories became French and British protectorates. France received a mandate to administer Douala. A treaty was signed with the local chiefs.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1946, it was the capital of Cameroon.<ref> Mark Dike DeLancey, Mark W. Delancey, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2019, p. 176</ref> In 1955 the city had over 100,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn 1960 Cameroon became independent and it became a federal republic, with its capital in [[Yaound\u00e9]]. Douala became the major economic city. In 1972 the federal republic became a unified state. Douala then had a population of around 500,000.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, in Cameroon the struggle for liberalization and [[Multi-party system|multi-partitism]] grew. Between May and December 1991, Douala was at the center of the civil disobedience campaign called the ghost town operation (''ville morte'') during which economic activities shut down to make the country ungovernable and to force the government to allow multi-partitism and freedom of expression.<ref>Edmond Kamguia Koumchou (2003), ''Le Journalisme du Carton Rouge''. Douala: Editions l'Etincelle d'Afrique.</ref>\n\n=== Name ===\nWith the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 15th century, the area was known as ''Rio dos Camar\u00f5es''.

It was renamed Douala in 1907 after the name of the natives known as Dua ala Ijaws (Njos), and became part of French Cameroon in 1919. Many of the Ijaw (Njo) natives migrated to the Niger Delta in Nigeria during the Portuguese era.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Pont sur le Wouri.JPG|thumb|Bridge over the Wouri River]]\nThe city is located on the banks of the [[Wouri River]], the two sides linked by [[Wouri River#Bridge|Bonaberi Bridge]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nDouala features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''), with relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year, though the city experiences somewhat cooler temperatures in July and August.

Akwa is Douala's business district and Bonanjo its administrative district. ''Plateau Joss'' is the name used historically for the current district of Akwa. The name of the districts refer to the Douala lineage, as well as the neighborhoods. For example, Akwa was historically divided between Bell and Deido into Bonadibong, Bonamilengue, Boneleke, Bonalembe, Bonejang, Bonamuti, Bonabekombo, Bonaboijan, and Bonakuamuang; the prefix \"bona\" means \"descendant of\".\n* [[Ball, Douala|Bali]], housing area located near Bonanjo administrative area.\n* [[B\u00e9panda]] is a very densely populated  neighbourhood. It is probably the most inhabited area of the city with lots of inhabitants coming from West Africa and from all parts of the country. The seat of the University of Douala and an important telecommunication centre of the Cameroon telecommunications are located there.\n* [[Deido]] is a historical neighbourhood located in the north central part of the city. It includes one of the main junctions of the city known as Le Rond-Point De\u00efdo and the symbol of the city \u201cthe Njounjou\u201d (\u201cthe monster\u201d).\n* [[Bonaberi]] is located on the right of Wouri River. It is primarily an industrial neighborhood but is gradually becoming a mixed area including more residential and commercial areas. It is connected by the two only bridges of the city. It is also the main opening toward the western anglophone area of the country.\n* [[Bonapriso]] is one of the wealthiest area of the city and even of the country. Historically a residential neighbourhood, it has become a mixed area including  commercial galleries, restaurants and shops.\n* [[Bonanjo]] is the administrative neighborhood, with many large administrations, larger companies and banks offices, with higher buildings than the rest of the city\n* [[Bonamoussadi]] is the main housing area located in the northern part of the city. In a first time very residential, it has recently witnessed a significant surge in the installation of malls, supermarkets, restaurants and even night clubs.\n* [[Kotto, Douala|Kotto]] is a modern residential neighbourhood next to Bonamoussadi. It developed in the early 1980s with the housing projects of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re du Cameroun (SIC) and is now the prime area for the small but increasing  middle and upper classes of the city.\n* [[New Bell, Douala|New Bell]] is an historical neighbourhood of the city. It was founded in the early 20th century with the expropriation by the Germans of the natives Duala people from the plateau Joss. It is known for housing since then newcomers in the city from all parts of the country and even from abroad (mainly west Africa). It today a very populous neighbourhood with very tough conditions. Two of the main markets of the city (Central market and March\u00e9 Nkololoun) are in the area.\n* [[Bassa, Douala|Bassa]] is a vast area in the eastern part of the city. It is a mixed area including  many neighborhoods (some wealthier than others) such as Logbaba, Ndogpassi, Cit\u00e9 des Palmiers, PK 8 and many others. It also includes one of the two major industrial zones of the city (the other being in Bonaberi).\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Ars&Urbis International Workshop - Emiliano Gandolfi 176.JPG|300px|thumb|right|[[Palace of the Kings Bell]]]]\nAccording to Jacques Soulillou,<ref>Jacques Soulillou (1989), ''Douala, un si\u00e8cle en images''.

The plan included a [[Former general Hospital of Douala|hospital]], the [[Old German government headquarters in Douala|governor residency]], the palace of justice, the [[Former police station of Douala|police station]], administrative buildings and buildings for the port and customs (among those the [[Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House in Douala|Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House]]). The [[Bonakouamouang Chimney]] also dates back to this period. In 1904 construction of the [[Villa Mandessi Bell]] was begun. In 1905 the [[Palace of the Kings Bell|palace of the King Manga Ndumbe Bell]] (also called la Pagode) was built, and in 1906 the general plan of Gross Douala was established. In 1914 the large population living in Bonanjo was moved to the new estate of Neue Bell (New Bell).\n\nBetween 1925 and 1930, during the French colonial period, the [[Chamber of Commerce (Douala 1927-1928)|chamber of commerce]], the [[Former palace of Justice of Douala|new palace of justice]], the new railway station, the [[vault of the Kings Bell]] and the catholic [[Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, Douala|cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul]] were built. Constructions were intensified between 1930 and 1955 and in 1955 the bridge on Wouri River was built. In 1935 the [[Mausoleum of the Kings Akwa]] was constructed. In 1947 the [[Temple of the Centenary in Douala|Temple of the Centenary]] was built. In 1959 a new city plan was designed (Plan Dorian); according to Dani\u00e8le Diwouta-Kotto,<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> this plan is still influencing Douala's urban development. After the independence of 1960 a new development and urban plan were established. In 1998 a research prepared the diagnostic for the 2015 horizon. In 2005 a new development and urban plan was designed and routes and public canalizations were reestablished and created. In the same year the Project Sawa-Beach was  launched. Since 1888, terracotta bricks have been  produced in Douala.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nThe publication ''Suites architecturales''<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> focuses on heritage and reappropriation in the architecture of Douala, and it presents some of the characteristics of the buildings and architecture of Douala after its independence. Among those buildings are the casino, the show-room La Meublerie, the exhibition hall Cami-Toyota, [[Union Bank of Cameroon]], Immeuble Hollando, the Baptist church, Immeuble Victoria, headquarters of CA-SCB, [[doual'art|espace doual'art]], and Orange Flagship. The [[Palace Dika Akwa Mukanda]] was built in 1990.\n\nAlong the city's main thoroughfare lie some of Cameroon's best restaurants, coffee houses and French-style [[patisserie]]s; along the waterfront, many bars and bistros may be found, commanding views of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and nearby [[mangrove]] swamps.  Many of these are frequented by the city's large [[expatriate]] population, mainly French or Lebanese, most of whom work in the [[petroleum industry]].\n\n== Culture ==\n* [[Douala Maritime Museum]], Museum showcasing the rich maritime history of Douala. The building is shaped like a boat (however the museum only occupy 400 m2 of the building). It is located in the administrative area [[Bonanjo]]\n* [[Doual'art]], an art gallery/center\n* [[La Nouvelle Libert\u00e9]], a 12m piece from [[Joseph Francis Sum\u00e9gn\u00e9]] inaugurated in 2007. A permanent monumental sculpture made with recycled material located at a main roundabout in Douala. It is 12 meters high with a wingspan of 5 meters.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Douala]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Evangelical Church of Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Presbyterian Church in Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Union of Baptist Churches in Cameroon]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Integrity for All]] ([[Christian Missionary Fellowship and Associated Churches]]), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon ([[Assemblies of God]]).<ref> J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, \u2018\u2018Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices\u2019\u2019, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 484-486</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main article|Education in Cameroon}}\nAs in most large cities in Cameroon there are several [[Nursery school|nursery]], [[Primary school|primary]], [[Secondary school|secondary]] and [[high school]]s in the city. In recent years there has been a surge in the number of private schools. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It is interesting to note that there is also a large, informal educational sector that caters to a huge part of the population, mostly individuals with a primary school certificate or those with no education at all. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} This form of education is common in sectors like cloth manufacturing, bread making, construction, security, and car repairing. Individuals from these informal sectors are by far the most visibly deprived in neighborhoods such as Ndokoti, Bepanda, Village, Logbaba.\n\nThe city of Douala is home to a number of higher education institutions, including the [[University of Douala]].<ref>Presidential act n\u00b0 93/030 of 19 January 1993.</ref>There are also a number of professional schools, the most prominent one being the Douala Maritime institute. Douala has an [[aviation school]] called [[CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Gare de Bessengu\u00e9 2.JPG|thumb|Gare de Bessengu\u00e9, Douala's train station]]\nDouala is linked by [[Camrail|rail]] to [[Yaound\u00e9]], [[Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9]], [[Kumba]] and [[Nkongsamba]]. Douala has a fairly developed road network compared to other cities in Cameroon. However many of the city's roads have decayed due to years of neglect and corruption. Efforts have recently been made to renovate the city's roads, especially in the most deprived neighborhoods. In spite of the numerous domestic and international investments, the roads remain in deplorable state largely due to embezzlement and corruption. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[tram]] network is planned for Douala, with the first line projected to open in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/douala-tram-project-poised-to-launch.html|title=Douala tram project poised to launch|date=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Douala International Airport]] is located in the eastern part of the city. There are direct flights to several European cities, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and [[Istanbul]]. Regional and continental destinations include [[Abidjan]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Dakar]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Kinshasa]], [[Lagos]], [[Malabo]], and [[Nairobi]]. The airport is the busiest in the [[CEMAC]] area and is the hub for Cameroon's national carrier, Camairco. The airport is in dire need of renovations due to poor circulation and old infrastructure.\n\nThe [[seaport]] has {{convert|8.5|m|abbr=off}} of [[Draft (ship)|draft]].\n\n== Economy ==\nDouala is a city with a modest oil resource in Africa, but is in excellent agricultural condition, therefore it has one of best economies in Africa. However, it also faces some problems like other underdeveloped countries such as heavy civil service and bad climate (flood, tornado, storm) to business.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nMain economic parameters are:\n\n*'''GDP:''' $42.2 billion (2006 est.):\n* '''GDP growth rate''': 4.1% (2006 est.)\n* '''Exports-partners''': Spain 17.3%, Italy 13.8%, France 9.5%, South Korea 8.1%, UK 8.1%, Netherlands 7.9%, Belgium 4.9%, US 4.3% (2005)\n*'''Imports - partners''': France 21%, Nigeria 15%, Belgium 6.3%, China 5.6%, US 5.1%, Thailand 4.5%, Germany 4.2% (2005)\n\n=== Wealth and poverty ===\nEven though Douala is the economic center of Cameroon, a large percentage of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. Recent data shows that about thirty percent of the population lives in poverty (Avameg, Inc). While the aforementioned percentage is doubled for rural regions, poverty is a growing problem for Douala due to its steadily increasing population. Unlike the rural populations of Cameroon that can grow their own foods to lessen their expenses, Douala locals are disadvantaged by living in the port city where there are not many opportunities for monetary gain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Cameroon.html|title=Cameroon|website=www.nationsencyclopedia.com|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== People ==\n* [[Louis Brody]] (1892\u20131951), German actor\n* Prince [[Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell]] (1927\u20132012), chief of Douala<ref>{{cite web|title=Cameroun : qui \u00e9tait Son Altesse Royale le Prince Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell ?|url=http://www.afrik.com/cameroun-qui-etait-son-altesse-royale-le-prince-rene-douala-manga-bell|website=afrik.com|language=fr|date=4 January 2013}}.</ref> \n* [[Francis Bebey]] (1929\u20132002), author \n* [[Manu Dibango]] (1933\u20132020), musician, saxophonist and singer, world jazz, ethno-jazz.\n* [[Jean-Pierre Dikongu\u00e9 Pipa]] (1940\u2013), cineast\n* [[Patrick Baudry]] (1946\u2013), second French [[astronaut]] and first astronaut of an African country\n* [[Nton\u00e8 Nton\u00e8 Fritz]] (1954\u2013), politician\n* [[\u00c9lise Mballa]] (1961\u2013), dancer\n* [[Maka Kotto]] (1961\u2013), Canadian politician\n* [[Ang\u00e8le Etoundi Essamba]] (1962\u2013), photograph\n* [[Petit Pays]] (1967\u2013), singer, dancer, author\n* [[Blaise Bang]] (1968\u2013), artist\n* [[Hemley Boum]] (1973\u2013), writer\n* [[Achillek\u00e0 Komguem]] (1973\u2013), artist\n* [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pierre Wom\u00e9]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Killamel]] (1984\u2013), rap dancer\n* [[V\u00e9ronique Mang]] (1984\u2013), sport\n* Vital Mevengue (1978\u2014)\n* [[Paul-Georges Ntep]] (1992\u2013), footballer\n* [[Samuel Eto'o]] (1981\u2013), footballer\n* [[Narcisse Mouelle Kombi]](1962\u2013 ), writer and politician\n* [[Christian Ngan]] (1983\u2013 ), entrepreneur, business man and financier\n* [[Marc Kibong Mbamba]] (1988\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pascal Siakam]] (1994\u2013 ), basketball player - 2019 NBA Champion\n* [[Ibrahim Amadou]] (1993\u2013), footballer\n* [[Fidele Ntie-Kang]] (1976-), chemist\n* [[Elsa Kwin]], singer and competitor on [[The Voice Afrique Francophone]]\n* [[Kareyce Fotso]] (2010-), Cameroonian singer\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nDoula is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Strasbourg]], France\n*{{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Akhisar]], Turkey\n*{{flagicon|Senegal}} [[Dakar]], Senegal\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], United States\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Philadelphia]], United States\n*{{flagicon|Namibia}} [[Windhoek]],  Namibia\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of colonial governors of Cameroon]]\n* [[Timeline of Douala]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{See also|Timeline of Douala#Bibliography|l1=Bibliography of the history of Douala}}\n* {{in lang|en}} Brooke, James (1987). \"Informal Capitalism Grows in Cameroon.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.
