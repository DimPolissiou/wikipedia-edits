[73]\n\n\"Mister grotesque\" (the [[deputy]] [[Aldo Iv\u00e1n D\u00e1vila Morales]])\n\nAfter the deputy Aldo D\u00e1vila indicated that there have already been several deaths from atypical pneumonia in national hospitals, \"since they have received multiple calls from the health areas\" and that they could be COVID-19, [74] but it was not\u00a0 The tests have been carried out on them, the president, during the press conference of March 28, confirmed that the number of people infected by COVID-19 reached 34, of which 10 are already recovered. [75] He continued to express the\u00a0 President, now visibly angry, his rejection of the deputy's statements that \"he is not a doctor\" and instead of naming him by his name and surnames, he referred to him as \"Mister Grim Reaper\", and rebuked him saying that \"with that guy\u00a0 the only thing it causes is to scare the population more. \u201d The president read the list of cases diagnosed as atypical pneumonia and detailed hospital by hospital the number of patients, reporting that\u00a0 27 atypical pneumonias have occurred so far in March in the 38 hospitals, but this condition is totally different from the coronavirus;\u00a0 Of these 27 cases of atypical pneumonias, one person died and had a coronavirus swab, but it was negative, so the information provided by the deputy from Winaq was not only alarming but false, and was not\u00a0 He rules out that he had the intention of gaining prominence rather than generating panic.\n\nDeputy D\u00e1vila has earned the animosity of the Executive for his lackluster watering (not to say ill-mannered) during interpellations to government ministers.\u00a0 So rude has been the way in which the deputy D\u00e1vila rebukes the ministers, that the president issued instructions to the officials to call the deputies to sanity or otherwise abandon the summons.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[2020 in Central

{"title_page": "History of Guam", "text_new": " \n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=March 2011}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}\n}}\nThe '''history of Guam''' involves phases including the early arrival of [[Austronesian people]] known today as the [[Chamorros]] around 2000 BC, the development of \"pre-contact\" society, [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish Empire|colonization]] in the 17th century and the present [[United States|American]] rule of the island since the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. [[Guam|Guam's]] history of [[colonialism]] is the longest among the Pacific islands.\n\n==Guam prior to European contact==\n[[File:Gadao Guam.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Chief [[Gadao]] is featured in many legends about Guam before European colonization.]]\n\n===Migrations===\nIt is believed that Guam was first discovered by seafaring people who migrated from [[Southeast Asia]] around 2000 BC.\n<blockquote>The original inhabitants of Guam are believed to be descendants of [[Austronesian people]] originating from [[Southeast Asia]] as early as 2000 BC, having linguistic and cultural similarities to Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. These people evolved into the Chamorro people. They flourished as an advanced, horticultural and hunting society. They were expert seafarers and skilled craftsmen familiar with intricate weaving and detailed pottery who built unique houses and canoes suited to this region of the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guam-online.com/history/history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103071923/http://www.guam-online.com/history/history.htm |archive-date=2012-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMost of what is known about Pre-Contact (\"Ancient\") [[Chamorros]] comes from legends and myths, archaeological evidence, [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] accounts, and observations from visiting scientists like [[Otto von Kotzebue]] and [[Louis de Freycinet]].\n\n===Ancient Chamorro society===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 250\n| image1 = Ladrones - Hunter from Marianas -Boxer Codex (1590).jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] Hunter with Spear, as depicted in the [[Boxer Codex]] (1590) of the [[Philippines]]\n| image2 = Hunter from Marianas 2 - Boxer Codex (1590).jpg\n| caption2 = [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] Hunter with Bow, as depicted in the [[Boxer Codex]] (1590) of the [[Philippines]]\n}}\nWhen Europeans first arrived on Guam, Chamorro society roughly fell into three classes: matao (upper class), achaot (middle class), and mana'chang (lower class). The matao were located in the coastal [[Villages of Guam|villages]], which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds while the mana'chang were located in the interior of the island. Matao and mana'chang rarely communicated with each other, and matao often used achaot as a go-between.\n\nThere were also \"makhanas\" (shamans) and \"suruhanus\" (herb doctors), skilled in healing and medicine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9r0a2ww8KLcC&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Ancient Chamorro Society|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence J.|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=9781880188057|language=en}}</ref>Belief in spirits of ancient Chamorros called ''[[Taotao Mona]]'' still persists as remnant of pre-European society. Early European explorers noted the Chamorros' fast sailing vessels used for [[trade|trading]] with other islands of [[Micronesia]].\n\n===Latte===\nThe \"[[Latte Stones|latte stones]]\" familiar to Guam residents and visitors alike were in fact a recent development in Pre-Contact Chamorro society. The latte stone consists of a head and a base shaped out of limestone. Like the [[Easter Island]] statues, there is plenty of speculation over how this was done by a society without machines or metal, but the generally accepted view is that the head and base were etched out of the ground by sharp adzes and picks (possibly with the use of fire), and carried to the assembly area by an elaborate system of ropes and logs. The latte stone was used as a part of the raised foundation for a magalahi (matao chief) house, although they may have also been used for canoe sheds.\n\nArchaeologists using carbon-dating have broken Pre-Contact Guam (i.e. Chamorro) history into three periods: \"Pre-Latte\" (BC 2000? to AD 1) \"Transitional Pre-Latte\" (AD 1 to AD 1000), and \"Latte\" (AD 1000 to AD 1521). Archaeological evidence also suggests that Chamorro society was on the verge of another transition phase by 1521, as latte stones became bigger.\n\nAssuming the stones were used for chiefly houses, it can be argued that Chamorro society was becoming more stratified, either from population growth or the arrival of new people. The theory remains tenuous, however, due to lack of evidence, but if proven correct, will further support the idea that Pre-Contact Chamorros lived in a vibrant and dynamic environment.\n\n==Spanish era==\n[[File:Reception of the Manila Galleon by the Chamorro in the Ladrones Islands, ca. 1590.jpg|thumb|360x360px|Reception of the [[Manila galleon|Manila Galleon]] by the [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] in the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones Islands]], ca. 1590 [[Boxer Codex]]]]\n\n=== Magellan's first encounter with Guam ===\n[[File:Hernando de Magallanes del museo Madrid Fix.jpg|thumb|212x212px|[[Ferdinand Magellan]], Portuguese navigator who was the first European to visit Guam (March 6, 1521) while commanding the fleet that circumnavigated the globe]]\nThe first known contact between [[Guam]] and [[Western Europe]] occurred when a Spanish expedition led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese explorer sailing for the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Spain]], arrived with his 3-ship fleet in Guam on March 6, 1521 after a long voyage across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, from Spain. History credits the village of [[Umatac, Guam|Umatac]] as his landing place, but drawings from the navigator's diary suggest that Magellan may have landed in [[Tumon]] in northern Guam. The expedition had started out in Spain with five ships.

Magellan was eventually able to obtain rations and offered iron, a highly prized material, in exchange for fresh fruits, vegetables, and water.

Quipuha granted the lands on which the first Catholic Church in Guam, the Dulce Nombre de Maria {Sweet Name of Mary} Cathedral Basilica, was constructed in 1669. The original cathedral was destroyed during [[World War II]] and the present Cathedral, was constructed on the original site in 1955. Chief Quipuha died in 1669 but his policy of allowing the Spanish to establish a base on Guam had important consequences for the future of the island. It also facilitated the Manila [[Galleon trade]].\n\nA few years later, Jesuit priest [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]] and his assistant, [[Pedro Calungsod]], were brutally killed by Chief Mata'pang of Tomhom (Tumon), allegedly for baptizing the Chief's baby girl without the Chief's consent. This was in April 1672. Many Chamorros at the time believed baptisms killed babies: because priests would baptize infants already near death (in the belief that this was the only way to save such children's souls), baptism seemed to many Chamorros to be the cause of death.{{r|Rodgers}}{{rp|49}} San Vitores carried out his mission in a peaceful manner, preaching Christianity and moral values to the indigenous population. So when San Vitores was assassinated by Mata'pang, the Spanish forces attempted to capture the guilty. This led to a number of battles in which many Spanish and Chamorros died. Mata'pang himself was killed in a final battle on the Island of Rota in 1680.<ref name=\"Guam Online\" />\n\nDuring the course of the Spanish administration of Guam, lower birth rates and diseases reduced the population from 12,000{{r|Rodgers}}{{rp|47}} to roughly 5,000 by 1741{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. After 1695, Chamorros settled in five villages: [[Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a]], [[Agat, Guam|Agat]], [[Umatac]], [[Chalan Pago-Ordot, Guam|Pago]], and [[Fena, Guam|Fena]]. During this historical period, Spanish language and customs were introduced in the island and [[Catholicism]] became the predominant religion. The Spanish built infrastructures such as roads and ports, as well as schools and hospitals. Spanish and Filipinos, mostly men, increasingly intermarried with the Chamorros, particularly the new cultured or \"high\" people (''manak'kilo'') or gentry of the towns. In 1740, Chamorros of the Northern Mariana Islands, except [[Rota (island)|Rota]], were moved from some of their home islands to Guam. Documents from the Spanish period are the only historical sources about colonial and pre-colonial times in the island. As in the Philippines, Spanish scholars wrote about Chamorro culture and language, including dictionaries and anthropological reports which are of great historical value today.\n\nThe Galleon Era ended in 1815 following the [[Mexican Independence]]. Guam later was host to a number of scientists, voyagers, and whalers from Russia, France, and England who also provided detailed accounts of the daily life on Guam under Spanish rule. Through the Spanish colonial period, Guam inherited food, language, and surnames from Spain and [[Spanish America]].<ref name=\"Ms.G\">[Christina Gumatatotato Lecture], World History and Geography.</ref>\n\n==American era==\n\n===Capture of Guam===\n[[File:Piti 1900.jpg|middle|thumb|350px|The [[Villages of Guam|village]] of [[Piti, Guam|Piti]] shortly after Guam's capture by the Americans.\n]]\n[[File:Naval Governor of Guam, attends Arbor Day exercises at the Governor's Palace, c 1930.jpg|thumb|290px|Commander [[Willis W.

The Japanese immediately renamed the island \"Omiya Jima\" (Great Shrine Island).<ref>http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/wapa/guides/first/sec4.htm,retrieved 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nThe Japanese military occupation of Guam lasted from 1941 to 1944.<ref>Wakako Higuchi, ''The Japanese Administration of Guam, 1941-1944: A Study of Occupation and Integration Policies, with Japanese Oral Histories'' (Jefferson  McFarland, 2013); [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38466  online review]</ref> It was a coercive experience for the Chamorro people, whose loyalty to the United States became a point of contention with the Japanese. Several American servicemen remained on the island, however, and were hidden by the Chamorro people. All of these servicemen were found and executed by Japanese forces in 1942; only one escaped.\n\nThe second [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Battle of Guam]] began on July 21, 1944 with American troops landing on western side of the island after several weeks of pre-invasion bombardment by the U.S. Navy. After several weeks of heavy fighting, Japanese forces officially surrendered on August 10, 1944.\n\nGuam was subsequently converted into a forward operations base for the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Airfields were constructed in the northern part of the island (including [[Andersen Air Force Base]]), the island's pre-WWII [[Naval Base Guam|Naval Station]] was expanded, and numerous facilities and supply depots were constructed throughout the island.\n\nGuam's two largest pre-war communities (Sumay and [[Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a]]) were virtually destroyed during the 1944 battle. Many Chamorro families lived in temporary re-settlement camps near the beaches before moving to permanent homes constructed in the island's outer villages. Guam's southern villages largely escaped damage, however.\n\n===Self-determination===\nThe immediate years after [[World War II]] saw the [[United States armed forces|U.S. Navy]] attempting to resume its predominance in Guam affairs. This eventually led to resentment, and thus increased political pressure from Chamorro leaders for greater autonomy.\n\nThe result was the [[Guam Organic Act of 1950]] which established Guam as an unincorporated [[organized territory]] of the United States and, for the first time in Guam history, provided for a civilian government.\n\nThe [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], section 307, granted [[U.S. citizenship]] to \"all persons born in the island of Guam on or after April 11, 1899. In the 1960s, the island's required [[security clearance]] for visitors was lifted.\n\nOn September 11, 1968, eighteen years after passage of the Organic Act, Congress passed the \"[[Elective Governor Acts of 1968|Elective Governor Act]]\" (Public Law 90-497), which allowed the people of Guam to elect their own governor and lieutenant governor. Nearly four years later, Congress passed the \"Guam-Virgin Islands Delegate\" Act that allowed for one Guam delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The delegate has a voice in debates and a vote in committees, but no vote on the floor of the House.\n\nAlthough Public Law 94-584 established the formation of a \"locally drafted\" constitution (later known as the \"Guam Constitution\"), the proposed document was rejected by Guam residents in an [[Guamanian constitutional referendum, 1979|August 4, 1979 referendum]].\n\nIn the meantime, Guam's local government had formed several political status commissions to address possible options for self-determination. The following year after passage of the Guam Delegate Act saw the creation of the \"Status Commission\" by the Twelfth Guam Legislature.\n\nThis was followed by the establishment of the \"Second Political Status Commission\" in 1975 and the Guam \"Commission on Self-Determination\" (CSD) in 1980. The Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature established the \"Commission on Decolonization\" in 1996 to enhance CSD's ongoing studies of various political status options and public education campaigns.\n\nThese efforts enabled the CSD, barely two years after its creation, to organize a [[Guamanian status referendum, January 1982|status referendum]] on January 12, 1982. 49% of voters chose a closer relationship with the United States via [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]].\n\nTwenty-six percent voted for Statehood, while ten percent voted for the Status Quo (as an Unincorporated territory). A [[Guamanian status referendum, September 1982|subsequent run-off referendum]] held between Commonwealth and Statehood saw 73% of Guam voters choosing Commonwealth over Statehood (27%). Today, Guam remains an unincorporated territory despite referendums and a United Nations mandate to establish a permanent status for the island.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Contemporary Guam===\n[[File:Apra Harbor.jpg|left|thumb|290px|Guam contains several [[military base]]s including the [[U.S. Navy|United States Naval]] Station on the [[Point Udall (Guam)|Orote]] Peninsula shown here.]]\n\nGuam's [[U.S. military]] installations remain among the most strategically vital in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. When the [[United States]] closed its [[United States Navy|Naval]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] bases in the [[Philippines]] after the expiration of their leases in the early 1990s, many of the forces stationed there were relocated to Guam.\n\nThe removal of Guam's security clearance by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 allowed for the development of a [[tourism]] industry. The island's rapid economic development was fueled both by rapid growth in this industry as well as increased U.S. Federal Government spending during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn August 6, 1997, [[Korean Air Flight 801]], a Boeing 747-300 bound for Guam crashed into Nimitz Hill while on final approach to the airport, killing 228 of the 254 people on board.\n<ref>https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0001.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjXw4GchcLhAhWsZd8KHaMqDvYQFjACegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw2wCTFtrQhr7MTJi5nicNROhe</ref>\n\nThe Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which hit Japan particularly hard, severely affected Guam's tourism industry. Military cutbacks in the 1990s also disrupted the island's economy. Economic recovery was further hampered by devastation from Supertyphoons [[Typhoon Paka|Paka]] in 1997 and [[Typhoon Pongsona|Pongsona]] in 2002, as well as the effects of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on tourism.\n\nThere are signs that Guam is recovering from these setbacks. The increased arrivals of Japanese tourists reflect that country's economic recovery, as well as Guam's enduring appeal as a weekend tropical retreat. U.S. military spending has dramatically increased as part of the [[War on Terrorism]].\n\nRecent proposals to strengthen U.S. military facilities, including negotiations to transfer 8,000 [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] from [[Okinawa]], also indicate a renewed interest in Guam by the U.S. military. American forces were originally scheduled to relocate from Okinawa to Guam beginning in 2012 or 2013. However, that has been set back due to budget constrains and local resistance to the additional military presence.\n\n\"Cosmopolitan\" Guam poses particular challenges for Chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity in the face of [[acculturation]]. The increasing numbers of Chamorros, especially Chamorro youth, relocating to the U.S. Mainland has further complicated both the definition and preservation of Chamorro identity.\n\n==See also==\n{{Main article|Historical outline of Guam}}\n\n* [[Guam]]\n* [[Villages of Guam]]\n* [[San Vitores]]\n* [[Chief Kepuha]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Robert F.

The latte stone consists of a head and a base shaped out of limestone. Like the [[Easter Island]] statues, there is plenty of speculation over how this was done by a society without machines or metal, but the generally accepted view is that the head and base were etched out of the ground by sharp adzes and picks (possibly with the use of fire), and carried to the assembly area by an elaborate system of ropes and logs. The latte stone was used as a part of the raised foundation for a magalahi (matao chief) house, although they may have also been used for canoe sheds.\n\nArchaeologists using carbon-dating have broken Pre-Contact Guam (i.e. Chamorro) history into three periods: \"Pre-Latte\" (BC 2000? to AD 1) \"Transitional Pre-Latte\" (AD 1 to AD 1000), and \"Latte\" (AD 1000 to AD 1521). Archaeological evidence also suggests that Chamorro society was on the verge of another transition phase by 1521, as latte stones became bigger.\n\nAssuming the stones were used for chiefly houses, it can be argued that Chamorro society was becoming more stratified, either from population growth or the arrival of new people. The theory remains tenuous, however, due to lack of evidence, but if proven correct, will further support the idea that Pre-Contact Chamorros lived in a vibrant and dynamic environment.\n\n==Spanish era==\n[[File:Reception of the Manila Galleon by the Chamorro in the Ladrones Islands, ca. 1590.jpg|thumb|360x360px|Reception of the [[Manila galleon|Manila Galleon]] by the [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] in the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones Islands]], ca. 1590 [[Boxer Codex]]]]\n\n=== Magellan's first encounter with Guam ===\n[[File:Hernando de Magallanes del museo Madrid Fix.jpg|thumb|212x212px|[[Ferdinand Magellan]], Portuguese navigator who was the first European to visit Guam (March 6, 1521) while commanding the fleet that circumnavigated the globe]]\nThe first known contact between [[Guam]] and [[Western Europe]] occurred when a Spanish expedition led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese explorer sailing for the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Spain]], arrived with his 3-ship fleet in Guam on March 6, 1521 after a long voyage across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, from Spain.

Quipuha granted the lands on which the first Catholic Church in Guam, the Dulce Nombre de Maria {Sweet Name of Mary} Cathedral Basilica, was constructed in 1669. The original cathedral was destroyed during [[World War II]] and the present Cathedral, was constructed on the original site in 1955. Chief Quipuha died in 1669 but his policy of allowing the Spanish to establish a base on Guam had important consequences for the future of the island. It also facilitated the Manila [[Galleon trade]].\n\nA few years later, Jesuit priest [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]] and his assistant, [[Pedro Calungsod]], were brutally killed by Chief Mata'pang of Tomhom (Tumon), allegedly for baptizing the Chief's baby girl without the Chief's consent. This was in April of 1672. Many Chamorros at the time believed baptisms killed babies: because priests would baptize infants already near death (in the belief that this was the only way to save such children's souls), baptism seemed to many Chamorros to be the cause of death.{{r|Rodgers}}{{rp|49}} San Vitores carried out his mission in a peaceful manner, preaching Christianity and moral values to the indigenous population.

Mata'pang himself was killed in a final battle on the Island of Rota in 1680.<ref name=\"Guam Online\" />\n\nDuring the course of the Spanish administration of Guam, lower birth rates and diseases reduced the population from 12,000{{r|Rodgers}}{{rp|47}} to roughly 5,000 by 1741{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

During this historical period, Spanish language and customs were introduced in the island and [[Catholicism]] became the predominant religion. The Spanish built infrastructures such as roads and ports, as well as schools and hospitals. Spanish and Filipinos, mostly men, increasingly intermarried with the Chamorros, particularly the new cultured or \"high\" people (''manak'kilo'') or gentry of the towns. In 1740, Chamorros of the Northern Mariana Islands, except [[Rota (island)|Rota]], were moved from some of their home islands to Guam. Documents from the Spanish period are the only historical sources about colonial and pre-colonial times in the island. As in the Philippines, Spanish scholars wrote about Chamorro culture and language, including dictionaries and anthropological reports which are of great historical value today.\n\nThe Galleon Era ended in 1815 following the [[Mexican Independence]]. Guam later was host to a number of scientists, voyagers, and whalers from Russia, France, and England who also provided detailed accounts of the daily life on Guam under Spanish rule. Through the Spanish colonial period, Guam inherited food, language, and surnames from Spain and [[Spanish America]].<ref name=\"Ms.G\">[Christina Gumatatotato Lecture], World History and Geography.</ref>\n\n==American era==\n\n===Capture of Guam===\n[[File:Piti 1900.jpg|middle|thumb|350px|The [[Villages of Guam|village]] of [[Piti, Guam|Piti]] shortly after Guam's capture by the Americans.\n]]\n[[File:Naval Governor of Guam, attends Arbor Day exercises at the Governor's Palace, c 1930.jpg|thumb|290px|Commander [[Willis W.

The Japanese immediately renamed the island \"Omiya Jima\" (Great Shrine Island).<ref>http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/wapa/guides/first/sec4.htm,retrieved 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nThe Japanese military occupation of Guam lasted from 1941 to 1944.<ref>Wakako Higuchi, ''The Japanese Administration of Guam, 1941-1944: A Study of Occupation and Integration Policies, with Japanese Oral Histories'' (Jefferson  McFarland, 2013); [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38466  online review]</ref> It was a coercive experience for the Chamorro people, whose loyalty to the United States became a point of contention with the Japanese. Several American servicemen remained on the island, however, and were hidden by the Chamorro people. All of these servicemen were found and executed by Japanese forces in 1942; only one escaped.\n\nThe second [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Battle of Guam]] began on July 21, 1944 with American troops landing on western side of the island after several weeks of pre-invasion bombardment by the U.S. Navy. After several weeks of heavy fighting, Japanese forces officially surrendered on August 10, 1944.\n\nGuam was subsequently converted into a forward operations base for the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Airfields were constructed in the northern part of the island (including [[Andersen Air Force Base]]), the island's pre-WWII [[Naval Base Guam|Naval Station]] was expanded, and numerous facilities and supply depots were constructed throughout the island.\n\nGuam's two largest pre-war communities (Sumay and [[Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a]]) were virtually destroyed during the 1944 battle. Many Chamorro families lived in temporary re-settlement camps near the beaches before moving to permanent homes constructed in the island's outer villages. Guam's southern villages largely escaped damage, however.\n\n===Self-determination===\nThe immediate years after [[World War II]] saw the [[United States armed forces|U.S. Navy]] attempting to resume its predominance in Guam affairs. This eventually led to resentment, and thus increased political pressure from Chamorro leaders for greater autonomy.\n\nThe result was the [[Guam Organic Act of 1950]] which established Guam as an unincorporated [[organized territory]] of the United States and, for the first time in Guam history, provided for a civilian government.\n\nThe [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], section 307, granted [[U.S. citizenship]] to \"all persons born in the island of Guam on or after April 11, 1899. In the 1960s, the island's required [[security clearance]] for visitors was lifted.\n\nOn September 11, 1968, eighteen years after passage of the Organic Act, Congress passed the \"[[Elective Governor Acts of 1968|Elective Governor Act]]\" (Public Law 90-497), which allowed the people of Guam to elect their own governor and lieutenant governor. Nearly four years later, Congress passed the \"Guam-Virgin Islands Delegate\" Act that allowed for one Guam delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The delegate has a voice in debates and a vote in committees, but no vote on the floor of the House.\n\nAlthough Public Law 94-584 established the formation of a \"locally drafted\" constitution (later known as the \"Guam Constitution\"), the proposed document was rejected by Guam residents in an [[Guamanian constitutional referendum, 1979|August 4, 1979 referendum]].\n\nIn the meantime, Guam's local government had formed several political status commissions to address possible options for self-determination. The following year after passage of the Guam Delegate Act saw the creation of the \"Status Commission\" by the Twelfth Guam Legislature.\n\nThis was followed by the establishment of the \"Second Political Status Commission\" in 1975 and the Guam \"Commission on Self-Determination\" (CSD) in 1980. The Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature established the \"Commission on Decolonization\" in 1996 to enhance CSD's ongoing studies of various political status options and public education campaigns.\n\nThese efforts enabled the CSD, barely two years after its creation, to organize a [[Guamanian status referendum, January 1982|status referendum]] on January 12, 1982. 49% of voters chose a closer relationship with the United States via [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]].\n\nTwenty-six percent voted for Statehood, while ten percent voted for the Status Quo (as an Unincorporated territory). A [[Guamanian status referendum, September 1982|subsequent run-off referendum]] held between Commonwealth and Statehood saw 73% of Guam voters choosing Commonwealth over Statehood (27%). Today, Guam remains an unincorporated territory despite referendums and a United Nations mandate to establish a permanent status for the island.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Contemporary Guam===\n[[File:Apra Harbor.jpg|left|thumb|290px|Guam contains several [[military base]]s including the [[U.S. Navy|United States Naval]] Station on the [[Point Udall (Guam)|Orote]] Peninsula shown here.]]\n\nGuam's [[U.S. military]] installations remain among the most strategically vital in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. When the [[United States]] closed its [[United States Navy|Naval]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] bases in the [[Philippines]] after the expiration of their leases in the early 1990s, many of the forces stationed there were relocated to Guam.\n\nThe removal of Guam's security clearance by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 allowed for the development of a [[tourism]] industry. The island's rapid economic development was fueled both by rapid growth in this industry as well as increased U.S. Federal Government spending during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn August 6, 1997, [[Korean Air Flight 801]], a Boeing 747-300 bound for Guam crashed into Nimitz Hill while on final approach to the airport, killing 228 of the 254 people on board.\n<ref>https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0001.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjXw4GchcLhAhWsZd8KHaMqDvYQFjACegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw2wCTFtrQhr7MTJi5nicNROhe</ref>\n\nThe Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which hit Japan particularly hard, severely affected Guam's tourism industry. Military cutbacks in the 1990s also disrupted the island's economy. Economic recovery was further hampered by devastation from Supertyphoons [[Typhoon Paka|Paka]] in 1997 and [[Typhoon Pongsona|Pongsona]] in 2002, as well as the effects of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on tourism.\n\nThere are signs that Guam is recovering from these setbacks. The increased arrivals of Japanese tourists reflect that country's economic recovery, as well as Guam's enduring appeal as a weekend tropical retreat. U.S. military spending has dramatically increased as part of the [[War on Terrorism]].\n\nRecent proposals to strengthen U.S. military facilities, including negotiations to transfer 8,000 [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] from [[Okinawa]], also indicate a renewed interest in Guam by the U.S. military. American forces were originally scheduled to relocate from Okinawa to Guam beginning in 2012 or 2013. However, that has been set back due to budget constrains and local resistance to the additional military presence.\n\n\"Cosmopolitan\" Guam poses particular challenges for Chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity in the face of [[acculturation]]. The increasing numbers of Chamorros, especially Chamorro youth, relocating to the U.S. Mainland has further complicated both the definition and preservation of Chamorro identity.\n\n==See also==\n{{Main article|Historical outline of Guam}}\n\n* [[Guam]]\n* [[Villages of Guam]]\n* [[San Vitores]]\n* [[Chief Kepuha]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Robert F.

The Lesser Antilles are at the outer edge of the [[Caribbean Plate]], and Guadeloupe is part of the outer arc of the [[Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc]]. Many of the islands were formed as a result of the [[subduction]] of [[oceanic crust]] of the Atlantic Plate under the [[Caribbean Plate]] in the [[Lesser Antilles subduction zone]]. This process is ongoing and is responsible for volcanic and earthquake activity in the region. Guadeloupe was formed from multiple volcanoes, of which only la Soufriere is not extinct.<ref name=\"jussieu\">{{cite web |title=Guadeloupe |url=http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/~beaudu/download/2004_Komorowski_VHA.pdf |website=Institut de physique du globe de Paris |publisher=Universite de Paris |accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref> Its last eruption was in 1976, and led to the evacuation of the southern part of Basse-Terre. 73,600 people were displaced over a course of three and a half months following the eruption.\n\n[[K\u2013Ar dating]] indicates that the three northern [[massif]]s on [[Basse-Terre Island]] are 2.79 million years old.

Popular music artists and bands such as [[Experience 7]], [[Francky Vincent]], [[Kassav']] (which included Patrick St-Eloi, and Gilles Floro) embody the more traditional music styles of the island, whilst other musical artists such as the punk band The Bolokos [https://www.rci.fm/guadeloupe/infos/Culture/Bolokos-veritable-succes-pour-les-guadeloupeens-au-festival-anglais-Rebellion (1)] or Tom Frager focus on more international genres such as [[Rock music|rock]] or [[reggae]].

One of the first known composers of African origin was born in Guadeloupe, [[Chevalier de Saint-Georges|Le Chevalier de Saint-Georges]], a contemporary of [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and a celebrated figure in Guadeloupe.

This nine-stage, four-day event attracts competitors from around the world (mostly Caribbeans, Americans, and Europeans). The Karujet, generally made up of seven races around the island, has an established reputation as one of the most difficult championships in which to compete.\n\nThe [[Route du Rhum]] is one of the most prominent nautical French sporting events, occurring every four years.\n\nBodybuilder [[Serge Nubret]] was born in [[Anse-Bertrand]], [[Grande-Terre]], representing the French state in various bodybuilding competitions throughout the 1960s and 1970s including the [[International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness|IFBB]]'s [[Mr. Olympia]] contest, taking 3rd place every year from 1972 to 1974, and 2nd place in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getbig.com/results/e-mroly.htm|title=Mr. Olympia Contest Results|website=www.getbig.com}}</ref> Bodybuilder [[Marie Mahabir|Marie-Laure Mahabir]] also hails from Guadeloupe.\n\nThe country has also a passion for cycling.

The Lesser Antilles are at the outer edge of the [[Caribbean Plate]], and Guadeloupe is part of the outer arc of the [[Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc]].

This process is ongoing and is responsible for volcanic and earthquake activity in the region.
