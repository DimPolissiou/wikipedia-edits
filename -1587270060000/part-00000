The town was re-peopled and ruled by [[Chauhan]]s around thirteenth century. At the start of the seventeenth century, the [[Palanpur State]] was taken over by Jhalori dynasty of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] (Lohani, Bihari Pathan) tribe which was founded in 1373 and ruled from [[Jalore|Jhalor]]. The dynasty came  into historical prominence during the period of instability that followed the demise of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] in the early 18th century. It was overrun soon afterwards by the [[Maratha]]s; the Lohanis followed the trend of seeking recourse in the [[British East India Company]] against them and finally entered the [[subsidiary alliance]] system in 1817, along with all other neighbouring states, becoming a [[British protectorate]] governed by [[Palanpur Agency]]. After [[independence of India]] in 1947, Palanpur State was dissolved in 1949 and merged with [[Union of India]] as a part of [[Bombay State]].

Once, when hunting Malik Mujahid Khan was surprised and carried prisoner to [[Sirohi]]. He was treated with great kindness, given a palace to live in, and as much luxury as he choose. In revenge of his capture, Maliks Mina and Piara, the leader of his forces, ravaged the Sirohi districts, and one night making their way to the palace where Malik Mujahid was confined, found him enjoying the society of courtesans. He refused to leave the lady and the Maliks returned disappointed. Shortly after, the succeeded in capturing Kunvar Mandan, the heir to Sirohi, while he was sitting at night over a forest pool waiting for game. Threatening to make the Kunvar a Muslim, the Jhaloris so frightened the Rao of Sirohi, that he not only set Malik Mujahid free but ceded to him the district of Virgam. After ruling at Jhalor for five years Malik Mujahid died in 1509 (915 H.). While Mujahid was in captivity at Sirohi, Malik Hetam Khan ruled in Jhalor. After Mujahid Khan's death, Sultan [[Mahmud Begada]] entrusted the rule of [[Jalore|Jhalor]] and [[Sanchore|Sachor]] to Shah Jiva, son of Balu Khan. Dying in 1512 (918 H.), he was succeeded by Malik Ali Sher, son of Budhan Khan Jhalori. During Malik Ali Sher's rule, the [[Rathore|Rathod]]s of [[Mandore|Mandovar]] in [[Malwa]] advanced against Jhalor, forced their way close to the city, and were with difficulty driven back, after a three days fight.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=319}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\nDying in 1525 (931 H.), Ali Sher was followed by his son Malik Sikandar Khan, who, like his father, suffered from the attacks of his Hindu neighbours.

In 1555 (962 H.), five years after the death of Ghazni Khan, Fateh Khan [[Baloch tribe|Baloch]] of [[Tervada]] and [[Radhanpur]], one of the most powerful of the Gujarat nobles, marched against Jhalor. Maliks Khanji and Khuram Khan joined battle with the Baloch force before Jhalor. But, in spite of the greatest bravery on the part of its defenders, Jhalor was taken and Khuram Khan slain.

After Pahar Khan came his uncle Malik Firoz Khan, also called Kamal Khan, a distinguished soldier, who, and his son Malik Mujahid Khan, greatly enlarged the family estate, and, it is said, obtained the title of Nawab.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=320}}<ref name=\"roy\"/> He constructed Mansarovar, a lake dedicated to his queen Manbai Jadeja in 1628.\n\nUnder Mughal prince [[Murad Baksh]], Mujahid Khan was, in 1654, appointed governor, ''faujdar'', of [[Anhilwad Patan]]. Twenty years later (1674) his father Kamal Khan, who had been removed from the government of Palanpur, was restored to his former post. In 1697, Mujahid Khan was sent to levy the capitation tax from the Hindus of Palanpur and Jhalor, and, in 1699, the government of Jhalor and Sachor was taken from him and given to [[Ajit Singh of Marwar|Ajitsing Rathod of Jodhpur]] ; Jhalor was never recovered, and from that time the headquarters of the family had been at Palanpur. Rajgadhi, the residence of queens, was built in 1697. Dying without male issue, Mujahid was succeeded by his brother Salim Khan, and he, in 1700, by his son Kamal Khan. Kamal Khan conducted the affairs of the chiefdom prosperously, and was succeeded in 1708 by his son Firoz Khan also called Ghazni Khan.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=320}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\nAbout eight years later (1716) Ajitsing Rathod of Jodhpur was chosen Viceroy of Gujarat, and, as he passed from Jhalor to Ahmedabad, Firoz Khan went to meet him, and in return for an offer of service, received the Sirohi district of Dantavada. In the anarchy that prevailed about this time (1720), the Jhaloris turned their thoughts to gain independence. On the death of Firoz Khan (about 1722) his two sons Kamal Khan and Karimdad Khan struggled for the chiefship. Karimdad Khan won in the end and put his brother to death. During his viceroyalty of Gujarat, Karimdad accompanied [[Abhai Singh of Marwar|Rathod Abhaysing]], Maharaja of Jodhpur, in his expedition against Sirohi, and won Palanpur, [[Dhanera]], Malana, Surbakri, Dabela, Roh, and Sarotra from Sirohi.

On Pahar Khan's death his uncle Bahadur Khan, son of Firoz Khan, succeeded and continued in the chiefship till 1768. In 1753 Bahadur Khan was forced by Patel Vithal Sakdev to agree to a yearly payment of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), and five years later (1758), the Peshwa's deputy, [[Sadashivrao Bhau|Sadashiv Ramchandra]], compelled him to pay a tribute of \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000).{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=321}}<ref name=\"roy\"/> In 1750 (Samvat 1806), Bahadur Khan built a brick and mortar city-wall, the ''Nagarkot'' of Palanpur.

The gateways of the city-walls were Delhi Darwaja, Gathaman Darwaja, Malan Darwaja, Mira Darwaja, Virbai Darwaja, Salempura Darwaja, Sadarpur Darwaja or Shimla Darwaja. Only Mira Darwaja survives today.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Salim Khan. Bahadur Khan drove Chauhan Jetmalji of Dhema out of [[Tharad]] and held this estate until dispossessed by Nawab Kamal-ud-din Khan Babi, commonly known as Jawan Mard Khan II of [[Radhanpur State]]. Salim Khan ruled till 1781, when he died and was succeeded by his son Sher Khan, who killed his brothers fearing that they might compete with him for the chiefship. Sher Khan died without male issue in 1788 or 1791. He was probably poisoned by his sister. On his death his sister Sona Bubu, who had married into the Babi family, raised her son Mubariz Khan to the chiefship. The nobles displeased at her conduct, revolted and dethroning Mubariz Khan placed Shamsher Khan on the throne. Firoz Khan, son of Fateh Khan, the grandson of Firoz Khan, now preferred his claim, and, the old vassals rallying round him, gained the chiefship in 1794. The state was, in 1809, brought in contact with the [[British East India Company]], when an agreement was entered into by the chief to pay the [[Gaekwad]] a yearly tribute of \u00a34375 (Babashai Rs. 50,001). For some years, the chief power had been in the hands of a faction of Sindhi Jamadars, who, in 1812, under the suspicion that he was about to reduce their power, murdered Firoz Khan, when out hunting.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=321}} They offered the succession to his only son Fateh Khan, then thirteen years old.

It was also arranged that Shamsher Khan should manage the state and give his daughter in marriage to Fateh Khan. The constant tussle between uncle and nephew resulted in the negotiation between two mediated by the British but later when the negotiations were left by both, British force led by Colonel Elrington attacked Palanpur on 10 October 1817. Shamsher Khan with the Palanpur troops attacked the force, and after a slight skirmish retreated inside the walls. The town was then assaulted and carried.

He refused to leave the lady and the Maliks returned disappointed. Shortly after, the succeeded in capturing Kunvar Mandan, the heir to Sirohi, while he was sitting at night over a forest pool waiting for game. Threatening to make the Kunvar a Muslim, the Jhaloris so frightened the Rao of Sirohi, that he not only set Malik Mujahid free but ceded to him the district of Virgam. After ruling at Jhalor for five years Malik Mujahid died in 1509 (915 H.). While Mujahid was in captivity at Sirohi, Malik Hetam Khan ruled in Jhalor. After Mujahid Khan's death, Sultan [[Mahmud Begada]] entrusted the rule of [[Jalore|Jhalor]] and [[Sanchore|Sachor]] to Shah Jiva, son of Balu Khan. Dying in 1512 (918 H.), he was succeeded by Malik Ali Sher, son of Budhan Khan Jhalori. During Malik Ali Sher's rule, the [[Rathore|Rathod]]s of [[Mandore|Mandovar]] in [[Malwa]] advanced against Jhalor, forced their way close to the city, and were with difficulty driven back, after a three days fight.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=319}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\nDying in 1525 (931 H.), Ali Sher was followed by his son Malik Sikandar Khan, who, like his father, suffered from the attacks of his Hindu neighbours. In 1542 (949 H.), [[Maldeo Rathore|Rao Maldev]] of [[Jodhpur State]] besieged, took, and plundered Jhalor, and, in the next year (1543), took plundered Sachor. Dying in 1548 (955 H), Malik Sikandar was succeeded by Malik Ghazni Khan, son of Hetam Khan, who, during a reign of two years, restored the power of the Jhalori family, and was succeeded by Malik Khanji, a man of great bravery and of prodigious personal strength. In 1555 (962 H.), five years after the death of Ghazni Khan, Fateh Khan [[Baloch tribe|Baloch]] of [[Tervada]] and [[Radhanpur]], one of the most powerful of the Gujarat nobles, marched against Jhalor. Maliks Khanji and Khuram Khan joined battle with the Baloch force before Jhalor. But, in spite of the greatest bravery on the part of its defenders, Jhalor was taken and Khuram Khan slain. For fifteen years Baloch held Jhalor. Then, 1570 (977 H.), Malik Khanji, gathering some followers, came against the city and won it back.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=319}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\nMalik Khanji died in 1576 (984 H.). He left two sons Ghazni Khan and Firoz Khan, and a daughter named Tarabai. He was succeeded by Ghazni Khan, who, according to the [[Mirat-i-Ahmadi]], served the state with 7000 horse. Attempting to raise north Gujarat on behalf of Sultan Muzaffar of [[Gujarat Sultanate]], he was imprisoned by [[Akbar]]'s order, but, afterwards submitting, was in 1589-90 reinstated at Jhalor. Seven years later (1597), according to the Palanpur records, Ghazni Khan driving back an invasion of the Afghan tribes, received the title of Diwan and the government of [[Lahore]].{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=320}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\n====Palanpur State====\n{{for|overview|Palanpur State}}\n[[File:Palanpuragency.png|thumb|Map of Palanpur State area in 1922]]\n[[File:Jorawar Palce Aerial View Palanpur Gujarat 1936.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of Jorawar Palace, 1936]]\nDuring his rule Ghazni Khan's brother, Malik Firoz Khan took Palanpur and [[Deesa]], establishing himself at Palanpur. Ghazni Khan, dying in 1614 (1023 H.), was succeeded by his son Pahar Khan, who, found guilty of [[matricide]], was, in 1616, by the Emperor's orders, trampled to [[Execution by elephant|death by an elephant]]. After Pahar Khan came his uncle Malik Firoz Khan, also called Kamal Khan, a distinguished soldier, who, and his son Malik Mujahid Khan, greatly enlarged the family estate, and, it is said, obtained the title of Nawab.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=320}}<ref name=\"roy\"/> He constructed Mansarovar, a lake dedicated to his queen Manbai Jadeja in 1628.\n\nUnder Mughal prince [[Murad Baksh]], Mujahid Khan was, in 1654, appointed governor, ''faujdar'', of [[Anhilwad Patan]]. Twenty years later (1674) his father Kamal Khan, who had been removed from the government of Palanpur, was restored to his former post. In 1697, Mujahid Khan was sent to levy the capitation tax from the Hindus of Palanpur and Jhalor, and, in 1699, the government of Jhalor and Sachor was taken from him and given to [[Ajit Singh of Marwar|Ajitsing Rathod of Jodhpur]] ; Jhalor was never recovered, and from that time the headquarters of the family had been at Palanpur. Rajgadhi, the residence of queens, was built in 1697. Dying without male issue, Mujahid was succeeded by his brother Salim Khan, and he, in 1700, by his son Kamal Khan. Kamal Khan conducted the affairs of the chiefdom prosperously, and was succeeded in 1708 by his son Firoz Khan also called Ghazni Khan.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=320}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\nAbout eight years later (1716) Ajitsing Rathod of Jodhpur was chosen Viceroy of Gujarat, and, as he passed from Jhalor to Ahmedabad, Firoz Khan went to meet him, and in return for an offer of service, received the Sirohi district of Dantavada. In the anarchy that prevailed about this time (1720), the Jhaloris turned their thoughts to gain independence. On the death of Firoz Khan (about 1722) his two sons Kamal Khan and Karimdad Khan struggled for the chiefship. Karimdad Khan won in the end and put his brother to death. During his viceroyalty of Gujarat, Karimdad accompanied [[Abhai Singh of Marwar|Rathod Abhaysing]], Maharaja of Jodhpur, in his expedition against Sirohi, and won Palanpur, [[Dhanera]], Malana, Surbakri, Dabela, Roh, and Sarotra from Sirohi. Dying about 1730 he was succeeded by his son Pahar Khan, who ruled until about 1744, when he died without male issue.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=321}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\n[[File:Mira Gate, Palanpur.jpg|thumb|Mira Gate, the only surviving gate of city walls built by Bahadur Khan (1743 - 1768)]]\nDuring Pahar Khan's rule, in 1736, Kantaji Kadam and [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] made a sudden attack on north Gujarat and plundered Palanpur, when the chief agreed to pay a tribute of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). On Pahar Khan's death his uncle Bahadur Khan, son of Firoz Khan, succeeded and continued in the chiefship till 1768. In 1753 Bahadur Khan was forced by Patel Vithal Sakdev to agree to a yearly payment of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), and five years later (1758), the Peshwa's deputy, [[Sadashivrao Bhau|Sadashiv Ramchandra]], compelled him to pay a tribute of \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000).{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=321}}<ref name=\"roy\"/> In 1750 (Samvat 1806), Bahadur Khan built a brick and mortar city-wall, the ''Nagarkot'' of Palanpur. It was 3 miles round, 17 to 20 feet high and 6 feet broad with seven bastioned gateways,and, at the corners, round towers armed with guns. The gateways of the city-walls were Delhi Darwaja, Gathaman Darwaja, Malan Darwaja, Mira Darwaja, Virbai Darwaja, Salempura Darwaja, Sadarpur Darwaja or Shimla Darwaja. Only Mira Darwaja survives today.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Salim Khan. Bahadur Khan drove Chauhan Jetmalji of Dhema out of [[Tharad]] and held this estate until dispossessed by Nawab Kamal-ud-din Khan Babi, commonly known as Jawan Mard Khan II of [[Radhanpur State]]. Salim Khan ruled till 1781, when he died and was succeeded by his son Sher Khan, who killed his brothers fearing that they might compete with him for the chiefship. Sher Khan died without male issue in 1788 or 1791. He was probably poisoned by his sister. On his death his sister Sona Bubu, who had married into the Babi family, raised her son Mubariz Khan to the chiefship. The nobles displeased at her conduct, revolted and dethroning Mubariz Khan placed Shamsher Khan on the throne. Firoz Khan, son of Fateh Khan, the grandson of Firoz Khan, now preferred his claim, and, the old vassals rallying round him, gained the chiefship in 1794. The state was, in 1809, brought in contact with the [[British East India Company]], when an agreement was entered into by the chief to pay the [[Gaekwad]] a yearly tribute of \u00a34375 (Babashai Rs. 50,001). For some years, the chief power had been in the hands of a faction of Sindhi Jamadars, who, in 1812, under the suspicion that he was about to reduce their power, murdered Firoz Khan, when out hunting.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=321}} They offered the succession to his only son Fateh Khan, then thirteen years old. Fateh Khan, by the advice of his mother, refused the offer, and requested the British and Gaekwads for help and protection from his father's murderers. On this the Jamadars seized and imprisoned him, and raised his uncle Shamsher Khan, then chief of the districts of Deesa and Dhanera, to the chiefship.{{sfn | ''Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha'' | 2015 |page=321-322}}<ref name=\"roy\"/>\n\n[[File:Palanpur Agency British India 1896.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Map of the [[Palanpur Agency]]]]\n[[File:Taley Mohammed Khan Bahadur - Nawab of Palanpur.jpg|thumb|Tale Muhammad Khan Bahadur, Nawab of Palanpur|left]]\n\nBritish Captain Carnac, the Resident at [[Baroda State]], with the British and Gaekwad forces under the command of General Holmes, proceeded to Palanpur. Fateh Khan and Samsher Khan both surrendered to the force and Jamadars fled the town. On 22 December 1813, Fateh Khan was invested with the chiefship of Palanpur, and Shamsher Khan, having no issue, adopted him, and, except a small provision for a son of his own should one be born, made him heir to all his possessions including Deesa and Dhanera. It was also arranged that Shamsher Khan should manage the state and give his daughter in marriage to Fateh Khan. The constant tussle between uncle and nephew resulted in the negotiation between two mediated by the British but later when the negotiations were left by both, British force led by Colonel Elrington attacked Palanpur on 10 October 1817. Shamsher Khan with the Palanpur troops attacked the force, and after a slight skirmish retreated inside the walls. The town was then assaulted and carried. Shamsher Khan and his followers retired to the hills taking Fateh Khan with them. Being pursued, Shamsher Khan took refuge in [[Nimaj]] (Neemuch), and Fateh Khan returned to Palanpur and accepted British [[suzerainty]]. He entered the [[subsidiary alliance]] system in 1817 becoming a [[British protectorate]]. Captain Miles was appointed as a British political agent under [[Palanpur Agency]].

Indiana stayed loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and Steele joined the 12th Indiana Regiment in the [[Union Army]] as a volunteer on May 2, 1861. He later transferred to the [[101st Regiment Indiana Infantry|101st Indiana Regiment]], in which he served until the conclusion of the war. Steele served under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in his famous [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. Following the [[Carolinas Campaign]] and the end of the war, Steele was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in July 1865.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in the Union's favor and with the United States restored, Steele transferred from the volunteer army to the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. Steele was promoted to the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] and served in the [[14th U.S. Infantry]]. His commission lasted for ten years, from February 23, 1866, to February 1876.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Pach Brothers - Benjamin Harrison.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Benjamin Harrison]] appointed Steele Governor of Oklahoma Territory.]]\nFollowing his retirement from the army, Steele returned to Indiana, where he settled in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]] and established a business that engaged in agricultural pursuits and pork packing. Steele's loyalty to the Union led him to join the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. He became active in local politics and gained enough support to win the race to serve as a Congressman from Indiana's 11th District in 1880. Steele was inaugurated on March 4, 1883. He retained his post for eight years, winning reelection in 1882, 1884, and 1886.\n\nAfter officially leaving office on March 3, 1889, Steele returned home to Marion. Within a year's time, on May 2, 1890, the western portion of the unorganized territory of modern-day [[Oklahoma]] became the [[Oklahoma Territory]]. Upon hearing reports of disorder and chaos in the new territory, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] wanted a former [[officer (armed forces)|military officer]] to serve as the territory's first governor. Harrison appointed Steele to the office,<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OK085.html Oklahoma Territory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122835/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OK085.html |date=November 14, 2011 }}, Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 15, 2013)</ref> and on May 22, 1890, Steele was inaugurated in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]], Oklahoma Territory.\n\n===Governor of Oklahoma Territory===\nImmediately upon entering office, Governor Steele declared a [[state of emergency]] throughout the Territory. This allowed him to best use his experience as a military officer. Steele supplemented the orderly processes of government for the Territory's disorderly situation. Unfortunately for the Governor, much of his time was occupied with a dispute with the [[Oklahoma Territory#Legislative branch|Oklahoma Territorial Legislature]]. The Legislature wanted to move the capital from Guthrie, first to [[Oklahoma City]] then to [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma|Kingfisher]]. All of these bills were vetoed by the Governor.\n\nSteele also urged the creation of a public school system and universities of higher education in the Territory. Through his work, the Legislature approved and established two universities: one in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] and another in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]]. The Norman Territorial University would become [[University of Oklahoma]], with the Stillwater A&M College becoming [[Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]].\n\nAfter only seventeen months in office, Governor Steele resigned the governorship effective October 18, 1891. In his place, President Harrison appointed [[Abraham Jefferson Seay]] to the governorship. [[Robert Martin (Oklahoma)|Robert Martin]], Secretary of Oklahoma Territory, served as Acting Governor from October 18, 1891, until February 1892, when Governor Seay took the oath of office.\n\n===National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Marion Branch===\nReturning to Marion, Steele remained a private citizen until he reentered state politics in 1894 when he was elected to once again represent Indiana's 11th District in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. His term officially began on March 4, 1895.\n\nWhile in the House, Steele served as the Chairman for the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Manufactures]], during the [[57th United States Congress]]. Steele remained in office as a Congressman until 1903, after serving eight years.\n\nThe existence of the Marion Branch was due, in great part to the leadership of George Steele, Sr. of Marion, who represented the 11th Congressional District of Indiana from 1880 to 1890. During his last term, he introduced legislation to establish a branch home in Grant County in the fiftieth session of congress, the measure coming up in December, and for seven months he watched the proceedings. The bill was approved by an Act of Congress and signed by President Grover Cleveland on July 23, 1888, entitled: \"An Act to authorize the location of a Branch Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Grant County, Indiana, and For Other Purposes\".\n\nApproval of Steele's bill was received with great enthusiasm in Marion, where the local newspaper predicted that the expenditure for the branch would total at least $500,000. News of the bills passing was favorably received in Grant County and on July 30, 1888 a celebration took place and it was estimated that the streets of Marion were thronged with the largest assemblage ever reported in Marion.<ref>Historical Files, Indiana Room of the Marion Public Library: Marion Daily Chronicle, The Soldiers' Home, October 8, 1888</ref> In early 1890 Steele became the first President of the First National Bank in Marion. However, at the request of President Benjamin Harrison, he took the position of governor of the Oklahoma Territory from mid 1890 to late 1891. Upon his return to Marion in 1894, he was elected Congressional representative for four more terms. Steele also served on the Board of Managers of the National Military Home at Marion from April 21, 1890, to December 10, 1904.  On December 11, 1904, Steele became the third director of the Marion Branch, moving to the Director's House on the grounds and serving until his retirement on May 31, 1915.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nSteele once again returned to life as private citizen in Marion. At the age of 83, Steele died on July 12, 1922 in Marion. He is buried there in Odd Fellows Cemetery.\n\nSteele's most enduring legacy would not be found in his home state of Indiana or in national politics, but in Oklahoma. He instituted Oklahoma Territory's first public school system, as well as to help establish Oklahoma's premier universities: University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University. One observer noted his tenure as Governor: \"He was a most capable executive and his unafraid service to the territory must not be minimized.\"<ref>Dan W. Peery, \"George W.

Steele was also the first [[Governor of Oklahoma Territory|Governor]] of [[Oklahoma Territory]] and was instrumental in developing the state's public education system and its two largest universities.\n\n==Early life and the American Civil War==\n[[File:Sherman sea 1868.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Steele served in Sherman's March to the Sea.]]\nSteele was born to Asbury and Marie Louise Steele in [[Fayette County, Indiana]], on December 13, 1839. He received an education from Indiana's [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system and then earned a law degree from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~oknowata/steele.htm\n|title= George Washington Steele|publisher= Ancestry.com |accessdate= October 10, 2012}}</ref> Following the completion of his education, Steele passed the [[bar exam]] and set up a practice in [[Hartford City, Indiana]].<ref>Everett, Dianna.

Indiana stayed loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and Steele joined the 12th Indiana Regiment in the [[Union Army]] as a volunteer on May 2, 1861. He later transferred to the [[101st Regiment Indiana Infantry|101st Indiana Regiment]], in which he served until the conclusion of the war. Steele served under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in his famous [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. Following the [[Carolinas Campaign]] and the end of the war, Steele was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in July 1865.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in the Union's favor and with the United States restored, Steele transferred from the volunteer army to the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. Steele was promoted to the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] and served in the [[14th U.S. Infantry]]. His commission lasted for ten years, from February 23, 1866, to February 1876.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Pach Brothers - Benjamin Harrison.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Benjamin Harrison]] appointed Steele Governor of Oklahoma Territory.]]\nFollowing his retirement from the army, Steele returned to Indiana, where he settled in [[Marion, Indiana|Marion]] and established a business that engaged in agricultural pursuits and pork packing. Steele's loyalty to the Union led him to join the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. He became active in local politics and gained enough support to win the race to serve as a Congressman from Indiana's 11th District in 1880. Steele was inaugurated on March 4, 1883. He retained his post for eight years, winning reelection in 1882, 1884, and 1886.\n\nAfter officially leaving office on March 3, 1889, Steele returned home to Marion. Within a year's time, on May 2, 1890, the western portion of the unorganized territory of modern-day [[Oklahoma]] became the [[Oklahoma Territory]]. Upon hearing reports of disorder and chaos in the new territory, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] wanted a former [[officer (armed forces)|military officer]] to serve as the territory's first governor. Harrison appointed Steele to the office,<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OK085.html Oklahoma Territory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122835/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OK085.html |date=November 14, 2011 }}, Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 15, 2013)</ref> and on May 22, 1890, Steele was inaugurated in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]], Oklahoma Territory.\n\n===Governor of Oklahoma Territory===\nImmediately upon entering office, Governor Steele declared a [[state of emergency]] throughout the Territory. This allowed him to best use his experience as a military officer. Steele supplemented the orderly processes of government for the Territory's disorderly situation. Unfortunately for the Governor, much of his time was occupied with a dispute with the [[Oklahoma Territory#Legislative branch|Oklahoma Territorial Legislature]]. The Legislature wanted to move the capital from Guthrie, first to [[Oklahoma City]] then to [[Kingfisher, Oklahoma|Kingfisher]]. All of these bills were vetoed by the Governor.\n\nSteele also urged the creation of a public school system and universities of higher education in the Territory. Through his work, the Legislature approved and established two universities: one in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] and another in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]]. The Norman Territorial University would become [[University of Oklahoma]], with the Stillwater A&M College becoming [[Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]].\n\nAfter only seventeen months in office, Governor Steele resigned the governorship effective October 18, 1891. In his place, President Harrison appointed [[Abraham Jefferson Seay]] to the governorship. [[Robert Martin (Oklahoma)|Robert Martin]], Secretary of Oklahoma Territory, served as Acting Governor from October 18, 1891, until February 1892, when Governor Seay took the oath of office.\n\n===National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Marion Branch===\nReturning to Marion, Steele remained a private citizen until he reentered state politics in 1894 when he was elected to once again represent Indiana's 11th District in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. His term officially began on March 4, 1895.\n\nWhile in the House, Steele served as the Chairman for the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Manufactures]], during the [[57th United States Congress]]. Steele remained in office as a Congressman until 1903, after serving eight years.\n\nThe existence of the Marion Branch was due, in great part to the leadership of George Steele, Sr. of Marion, who represented the 11th Congressional District of Indiana from 1880 to 1890. During his last term, he introduced legislation to establish a branch home in Grant County in the fiftieth session of congress, the measure coming up in December, and for seven months he watched the proceedings. The bill was approved by an Act of Congress and signed by President Grover Cleveland on July 23, 1888, entitled: \"An Act to authorize the location of a Branch Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Grant County, Indiana, and For Other Purposes\".\n\nApproval of Steele's bill was received with great enthusiasm in Marion, where the local newspaper predicted that the expenditure for the branch would total at least $500,000. News of the bills passing was favorably received in Grant County and on July 30, 1888 a celebration took place and it was estimated that the streets of Marion were thronged with the largest assemblage ever reported in Marion.<ref>Historical Files, Indiana Room of the Marion Public Library: Marion Daily Chronicle, The Soldiers' Home, October 8, 1888</ref> In early 1890 Steele became the first President of the First National Bank in Marion. However, at the request of President Benjamin Harrison, he took the position of governor of the Oklahoma Territory from mid 1890 to late 1891. Upon his return to Marion in 1894, he was elected Congressional representative for four more terms. Steele also served on the Board of Managers of the National Military Home at Marion from April 21, 1890, to December 10, 1904.  On December 11, 1904, Steele became the third director of the Marion Branch, moving to the Director's House on the grounds and serving until his retirement on May 31, 1915.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nSteele once again returned to life as private citizen in Marion. At the age of 83, Steele died on July 12, 1922 in Marion. He is buried there in Odd Fellows Cemetery.\n\nSteele's most enduring legacy would not be found in his home state of Indiana or in national politics, but in Oklahoma. He instituted Oklahoma Territory's first public school system, as well as to help establish Oklahoma's premier universities: University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University. One observer noted his tenure as Governor: \"He was a most capable executive and his unafraid service to the territory must not be minimized.\"<ref>Dan W. Peery, \"George W.

Starting off as a place for house shows for youth and by youth, it is billed as a [[drug-free]], positive environment that encourages expression and youth culture. Skrappy's specializes in live music, music and art classes, visual art, printing, photography, writing, publishing, activism, organizing, [[civic engagement]] and empowerment, and as an open drop in - providing food, clothing and other services.\n\n== History (1995-2005) ==\n\nSkrappy's has existed in some capacity since 1995, when it was founded by current proprietor, Kathy Wooldridge. In addition to hosting national bands (such as [[Botch (band)|Botch]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Give Up the Ghost (band)|Give Up the Ghost]]), a wide variety of local Tucson artists and small bands have played nearly nightly since its inception. As an alcohol-free haven, teens can listen to music and socialize. Over the years the service offerings have grown and expanded along with the networking. Besides the regular live shows featuring a mix of local and touring bands for which it is best known, Skrappy's offers job opportunities, drug counseling, classes and emergency clothing, blankets and shelter. Since 2002, Skrappy's has operated under the umbrella of [[Our Family Services]] (formally known as Our Town Family Center), a community service-based nonprofit social services providing agency. Skrappy's is nationally recognized as a model of positive youth development and civic engagement and offers a variety of programs from dance, film-making and art classes to health fairs and a host of volunteering opportunities.\n\nMore than a place for music - Skrappy's is a youth community; a safe, positive, drug and alcohol free environment where young people can freely express themselves through music, theatre, art, journalism, dance, and lifestyles. Skrappy's encourages youth to embrace who they are and helps them achieve their goals. Young people involved at Skrappy's learn valuable life and social skills. Whether they are helping run the center, playing in a band or participating in a class activity, they increase their self-esteem, refine leadership skills and strengthen their sense of community. Skrappy's is based on a \"do-it-yourself\" ethic, where young people have ownership of the program. It is a place to be heard, a place to grow, a place where young people give each other the support, acceptance, love and family structure that may be missing in their lives. Skrappy's was founded in the mid-1990s by a group of youth and adults dedicated to a dream of establishing a regular venue for underground or independent music in Tucson, Arizona. As a music venue, Skrappy's saw the rise of many Tucson native bands such as [[The Bled]], '''Versus the Mirror''', '''Blues''', '''The American Black Lung''', '''Line of Fire''', '''The Mean Reds''', '''Beyond the Citadel of Coup de Grace''' and many others.\n\n== Skrappy's involvement ==\n\n=== Art Classes at Old Pueblo Children's Academy ===\n\nIn January 2006, youth from Skrappy's began volunteering at Old Pueblo Children's Academy which is a kindergarten through eighth grade charter school. Originally, youth would go to the school once a week and work with two grades at a time, using art as a means to teach creative expression, conflict resolution, listening and communication skills. In August 2006, youth began volunteering there twice a week. It is an excellent opportunity for the youth to give back to some of the neediest sectors of the community. The students form trusting relationships with the volunteers and learn important life skills, while the volunteers gain valuable training in mentoring, communication, patience, being part of a community, as well as career training for those interested in education or social services.\n\n=== Project Contact ===\n\nThis is a program funded in part by the United States Department of Health and Human Services through the Arizona Family Planning Council that offers pregnancy testing, birth control, STI and [[HIV]] testing and [[emergency contraception]]. Three times a year, Project Contact puts on an event at Skrappy's offering free STI and HIV testing. The events educate youth on family planning, physical and emotional health, and connects them to further resources as well as giving them a chance to discuss openly and in a mature way issues that in other places are considered taboo.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130715012913/http://skrappys.net/\n\n=== Wrap It Up Jam ===\n\nOnce a year in the month of December, Planned Parenthood and Skrappy's hosts the Wrap It Up Jam in recognition of [[World AIDS Day]]. Free STI and HIV testing are offered, along with emergency contraception. The event educates youth on personal health and tolerance. By opening dialogue, it helps to make youth more conscientious and responsible world citizens.\n\n=== Project Safe Place ===\n\n\n\nSkrappy's is one of many sites in [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] for [[National Safe Place|Safe Place]], the national runaway prevention and intervention program for those under 18 and in crisis.  During the month of November, Skrappy's hosts an event in honor of National Runaway Prevention Month. Although the event changes yearly (2007 was youth art, musical performances, and movie screenings), the focus is on bringing to light the issue of youth runaways and homelessness. The youth involved come together from a variety of organizations to promote awareness of a prevalent problem and the myriad causes that lead to it.\n\n=== Volunteering with Community Service Youth ===\n\nAs a volunteer at Skrappy's, there are many opportunities to assist with the daily activities of this downtown youth-run activity and performing arts center. To socialize and receive help with connecting with community services. Depending on the age and availability of youth, these could include assisting in the caf\u00e9, charging front door during shows, security, sound managing, stage managing, band booking, helping with civic or after-school activities, and mentoring other youth.\n\nSkrappy's provides an excellent opportunity for kids on probation or who have community service to learn responsibility, life skills, and proper work ethic while at the same time exposing them to an alternative way to spend their time even after their service is over. Community service youth have the opportunity to volunteer in any of the aforementioned areas and can come out of it with the same life and career skills as other youth. These youth become connected to the Skrappy's community and in turn become connected to the larger community.\n\nThe youth at Skrappy's learn numerous life and job skills, leadership and social skills, how to research, communication skills, self-esteem, conflict resolution, educational opportunities, parenting skills, mentoring, volunteering in their communities, the arts, freedom of expression and passion through voice, friendship, youth and adult relationships, customer service, basic bookkeeping, inventory, responsibility, and employment. In the end they become proactive citizens involved in their community.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130715012913/http://skrappys.net/\n\n=== Closing of locations ===\n\nIn 2002, on the brink of closure, Skrappy's was temporarily relocated about two miles south of its 201 E. Broadway Blvd. location, behind a bread factory in an industrial area of Tucson. In 2003, a public grant allowed the venue to continue its existence at its original location. In 2005, Skrappy's was nearly shut down when a fight broke out after a show due to the actions of a few [[Friends Stand United|FSU]] members, resulting in a man's death along with injuries to others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/business/128282 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120546/http://www.azstarnet.com/business/128282 |archivedate=2007-09-29 }} Arizona Daily Star</ref> City officials were quick to come to the venue's rescue, and another grant allowed it to continue its existence. Since opening in 1995, Skrappy's has been in over five locations with Broadway being its longest place of headquarters.\n\n== Skrappy's (2006-) ==\nIn 2006, more than 16,000 young people walked through Skrappy's doors seeking self-expression, community engagement and a safe, stimulating, drug and alcohol-free environment. About 4,800 of those received services from Our Family's outreach staff in the form of food, clothing or referrals to other resources in the community. In 2006, more than 29,000 at-risk children, youth, families, seniors and disabled adults used the services which include counseling, education, housing, mediation and help for people in crisis. Aside from hosting shows, Skrappy's involved teens in break dancing classes, film and theater projects, training in art, karate, literacy, [[GPS]] mapping, sewing and fashion design. Skrappy's in effect became an urban park and after-school program deserving of public support. Skrappy's continued to have its usual shows until winter of that year when they were given a 90-day eviction notice. Their stay extended until the summer of 2007 with their last show at 201 E. Broadway Blvd in August. They moved out in September to [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]]' basement down the street and continued to provide services, but stopped doing shows. Skrappy's had the opportunity to move back to the industrial area near the bread factory on 17th street as a permanent location, but because of the lack of parking spaces required by the city and an unwelcoming neighborhood for youth, Skrappy's had no choice but to stay at Big Brothers Big Sisters. As a music venue, Skrappy's is an important pillar of Tucson's music scene and from a youth perspective, much of the scene's development has been focused around Skrappy's.\n\nIn 2008, Skrappy's found what seemed to be a home at 91 E. Toole Avenue, but because the building was not up to code and as a result, Skrappy's was homeless again. But the team of Skrappy's still did projects outside of a building, meeting at the houses of team members, collaborating with the University of Arizona and city officials of Tucson.\n\nAs of January 2009, Skrappy's relocated to 191 E. Toole Avenue in downtown Tucson, Arizona where it is in the development of construction - hoping to begin classes early in the summer and begin booking for shows late summer/early fall 2009.\n\n=== Skrappy's Tucson Youth Collective ===\n\nSkrappy's is now synonymous with Tucson Youth Collective (TYC), a board of youth making choices for the youth of Tucson. It is also a group of projects such as:\n\n'''Staples and Stitches''': Skrappy's all-ages venue's design school aimed at teaching basic sewing skills and D.I.Y. design to youth. With Staples and Stitches, there is an opportunity to learn the skills to enable them to make their own clothing, design and create themselves in every way possible and  feels that real fashion does not need to be dictated by Vogue magazine, seasons, trends, size, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Staples and Stitches was founded by [[Liz Albert]] in 2008 as a part of Skrappy's.\n\n'''Skrap Yard Recordings''': a recording studio used by Skrappy's to record bands, founded in 2007 by Michael Patton (not the well-known singer, [[Mike Patton]]) with Kathy Wooldridge.\n\n'''Desert Distro''': A D.I.Y. distribution center of records, CDs, clothing, movies and more. Desert Distro was founded by Chris Coco in 2008 as a part of Skrappy's Tucson Youth Collective.\n\nThere will be more classes and places of interest gathered for TYC throughout 2009 such as art karate, breakdancing, film classes and much more.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.skrappystyc.org/ Skrappy's official website]\n* [http://myspace.com/skrappys Skrappy's myspace]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/skrapyardrecording TYC: Skrap Yard Recordings]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/staplesandstitchesdiy TYC: Staples and Stitches]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/desertdistro TYC: Desert Distro]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120546/http://www.azstarnet.com/business/128282 Arizona Daily Star article about Skrappy's]\n    https://web.archive.org/web/20130715012913/http://skrappys.net/\n{{coord missing|Arizona}}\n{{Music venues of Arizona}}\n\n[[Category:Music venues in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Tucson, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Tucson, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Music venues completed in 1995]]\n[[Category:1995 establishments in Arizona]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Venue\n| name             = Skrappy's Tucson Youth Collective\n| image            = [[File:2006frontofskrappys.jpg|200px]]\n| image_caption    = \n| nickname         = Skrappy's\n| location         = [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]]\n| type             = [[Music venue]] and [[recreation center]]\n| genres           = [[Punk rock|Punk]]<br />[[Hardcore punk|Hardcore]]<br />[[Heavy Metal Music|Metal]]<br />[[Ska]]<br />[[Emo]]\n| opened           = 1995\n| renovated        = 2002\n| relocated        = 2009\n| expanded         = 2009 \n| capacity         = 50 (as of January 2009)\n| promotions       = \n| owner            = [[Kathy Wooldridge]]\n| former_names     = Skrappy's Tucson Youth Center\n| seating_type     = \n| seating_capacity = \n| website       = http://skrappystyc.org/<br/> https://myspace.com/skrappys<br/>https://web.archive.org/web/20130715012913/http://skrappys.net/\n}}\n\n'''Skrappy's''' is a youth-run, youth-oriented [[performing arts]] and after-school center as well as an all ages [[music venue]], performance space and community hub located in downtown [[Tucson, Arizona]].

The students form trusting relationships with the volunteers and learn important life skills, while the volunteers gain valuable training in mentoring, communication, patience, being part of a community, as well as career training for those interested in education or social services.\n\n=== Project Contact ===\n\nThis is a program funded in part by the United States Department of Health and Human Services through the Arizona Family Planning Council that offers pregnancy testing, birth control, STI and [[HIV]] testing and [[emergency contraception]]. Three times a year, Project Contact puts on an event at Skrappy's offering free STI and HIV testing. The events educate youth on family planning, physical and emotional health, and connects them to further resources as well as giving them a chance to discuss openly and in a mature way issues that in other places are considered taboo.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130715012913/http://skrappys.net/\n\n=== Wrap It Up Jam ===\n\nOnce a year in the month of December, Planned Parenthood and Skrappy's hosts the Wrap It Up Jam in recognition of [[World AIDS Day]]. Free STI and HIV testing are offered, along with emergency contraception. The event educates youth on personal health and tolerance. By opening dialogue, it helps to make youth more conscientious and responsible world citizens.\n\n=== Project Safe Place ===\n\n\n\nSkrappy's is one of many sites in [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] for [[National Safe Place|Safe Place]], the national runaway prevention and intervention program for those under 18 and in crisis.  During the month of November, Skrappy's hosts an event in honor of National Runaway Prevention Month. Although the event changes yearly (2007 was youth art, musical performances, and movie screenings), the focus is on bringing to light the issue of youth runaways and homelessness. The youth involved come together from a variety of organizations to promote awareness of a prevalent problem and the myriad causes that lead to it.\n\n=== Volunteering with Community Service Youth ===\n\nAs a volunteer at Skrappy's, there are many opportunities to assist with the daily activities of this downtown youth-run activity and performing arts center. To socialize and receive help with connecting with community services. Depending on the age and availability of youth, these could include assisting in the caf\u00e9, charging front door during shows, security, sound managing, stage managing, band booking, helping with civic or after-school activities, and mentoring other youth.\n\nSkrappy's provides an excellent opportunity for kids on probation or who have community service to learn responsibility, life skills, and proper work ethic while at the same time exposing them to an alternative way to spend their time even after their service is over. Community service youth have the opportunity to volunteer in any of the aforementioned areas and can come out of it with the same life and career skills as other youth. These youth become connected to the Skrappy's community and in turn become connected to the larger community.\n\nThe youth at Skrappy's learn numerous life and job skills, leadership and social skills, how to research, communication skills, self-esteem, conflict resolution, educational opportunities, parenting skills, mentoring, volunteering in their communities, the arts, freedom of expression and passion through voice, friendship, youth and adult relationships, customer service, basic bookkeeping, inventory, responsibility, and employment. In the end they become proactive citizens involved in their community.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130715012913/http://skrappys.net/\n\n=== Closing of locations ===\n\nIn 2002, on the brink of closure, Skrappy's was temporarily relocated about two miles south of its 201 E. Broadway Blvd. location, behind a bread factory in an industrial area of Tucson. In 2003, a public grant allowed the venue to continue its existence at its original location. In 2005, Skrappy's was nearly shut down when a fight broke out after a show due to the actions of a few [[Friends Stand United|FSU]] members, resulting in a man's death along with injuries to others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/business/128282 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120546/http://www.azstarnet.com/business/128282 |archivedate=2007-09-29 }} Arizona Daily Star</ref> City officials were quick to come to the venue's rescue, and another grant allowed it to continue its existence. Since opening in 1995, Skrappy's has been in over five locations with Broadway being its longest place of headquarters.\n\n== Skrappy's (2006-) ==\nIn 2006, more than 16,000 young people walked through Skrappy's doors seeking self-expression, community engagement and a safe, stimulating, drug and alcohol-free environment. About 4,800 of those received services from Our Family's outreach staff in the form of food, clothing or referrals to other resources in the community. In 2006, more than 29,000 at-risk children, youth, families, seniors and disabled adults used the services which include counseling, education, housing, mediation and help for people in crisis. Aside from hosting shows, Skrappy's involved teens in break dancing classes, film and theater projects, training in art, karate, literacy, [[GPS]] mapping, sewing and fashion design. Skrappy's in effect became an urban park and after-school program deserving of public support. Skrappy's continued to have its usual shows until winter of that year when they were given a 90-day eviction notice. Their stay extended until the summer of 2007 with their last show at 201 E. Broadway Blvd in August. They moved out in September to [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]]' basement down the street and continued to provide services, but stopped doing shows. Skrappy's had the opportunity to move back to the industrial area near the bread factory on 17th street as a permanent location, but because of the lack of parking spaces required by the city and an unwelcoming neighborhood for youth, Skrappy's had no choice but to stay at Big Brothers Big Sisters. As a music venue, Skrappy's is an important pillar of Tucson's music scene and from a youth perspective, much of the scene's development has been focused around Skrappy's.\n\nIn 2008, Skrappy's found what seemed to be a home at 91 E. Toole Avenue, but because the building was not up to code and as a result, Skrappy's was homeless again. But the team of Skrappy's still did projects outside of a building, meeting at the houses of team members, collaborating with the University of Arizona and city officials of Tucson.\n\nAs of January 2009, Skrappy's relocated to 191 E. Toole Avenue in downtown Tucson, Arizona where it is in the development of construction - hoping to begin classes early in the summer and begin booking for shows late summer/early fall 2009.\n\n=== Skrappy's Tucson Youth Collective ===\n\nSkrappy's is now synonymous with Tucson Youth Collective (TYC), a board of youth making choices for the youth of Tucson. It is also a group of projects such as:\n\n'''Staples and Stitches''': Skrappy's all-ages venue's design school aimed at teaching basic sewing skills and D.I.Y. design to youth. With Staples and Stitches, there is an opportunity to learn the skills to enable them to make their own clothing, design and create themselves in every way possible and  feels that real fashion does not need to be dictated by Vogue magazine, seasons, trends, size, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Staples and Stitches was founded by [[Liz Albert]] in 2008 as a part of Skrappy's.\n\n'''Skrap Yard Recordings''': a recording studio used by Skrappy's to record bands, founded in 2007 by Michael Patton (not the well-known singer, [[Mike Patton]]) with Kathy Wooldridge.\n\n'''Desert Distro''': A D.I.Y. distribution center of records, CDs, clothing, movies and more. Desert Distro was founded by Chris Coco in 2008 as a part of Skrappy's Tucson Youth Collective.\n\nThere will be more classes and places of interest gathered for TYC throughout 2009 such as art karate, breakdancing, film classes and much more.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.skrappystyc.org/ Skrappy's official website]\n* [http://myspace.com/skrappys Skrappy's myspace]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/skrapyardrecording TYC: Skrap Yard Recordings]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/staplesandstitchesdiy TYC: Staples and Stitches]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/desertdistro TYC: Desert Distro]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120546/http://www.azstarnet.com/business/128282 Arizona Daily Star article about Skrappy's]\n    https://web.archive.org/web/20130715012913/http://skrappys.net/\n{{coord missing|Arizona}}\n{{Music venues of Arizona}}\n\n[[Category:Music venues in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Tucson, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Tucson, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Music venues completed in 1995]]\n[[Category:1995 establishments in Arizona]]\n", "name_user": "MB", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix infobox image syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skrappys"}

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations.

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955. Philanthropist Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which only served the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 9, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a [[bookmobile]] to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962, the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee had been desegregated by 1958, yet it would be several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's, Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and social groups, as well as, public and private businesses throughout Florida and the nation.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Carrie Meek - James N.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee, which only served the black community, became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 9, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services, the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a [[bookmobile]] to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962, the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee had been desegregated by 1958, yet it would be several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's, Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In 1891 Sherwood was proclaimed a local government area, being part of the Yeerongpilly Division established by Xlll the Divisional Board Act of 1879, which instituted local government to sparsely populated districts of Queensland. \nThe future Sherwood Shire contained an area of 22 square miles. The most northerly landmark, Oxley Point (Chelmer), was on the Brisbane River, 5 miles southwest of Brisbane. Reaching this point by the Brisbane River, involved a journey of twelve miles. The northern and western boundaries of the shire were the Brisbane River from the mouth of Oxley Creek to Woogaroo Creek in the south-west with Oxley Creek forming the eastern boundary.  The southern boundary was the upper reaches of the Oxley creek proceeding in a south-easterly direction to a point 1 mile above the mouth of Woogaroo Creek to its junction with the Brisbane River.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189286|title=Suburban Conservatism in the Sherwood Shire, 1891-1920|last1=Fones|first1=Ralph|date=1 January 1993|website=UQ eSpace|publisher=The University of Queensland|format=PDF|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> \n== Early History == \n==== Brisbane River ====\nThree shipwrecked and disoriented ticket of leave convicts, [[Thomas Pamphlett|Pamphlet]], Finnegan and Parsons in June 1823 were walking and were diverted by the river to the mouth of Oxley Creek. The discovery of two native canoes allowed them to cross the river and journey downstream.  [[John Oxley]] in December 1823 named the creek \u2018Canoe Creek\u2019 in recognition of the discovery, but in time it was renamed [[Oxley Creek]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nDuring the 1820s, the river was used by convicts to convey limestone from Limestone Hill ([[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]) to the penal settlement at [[Brisbane]]. From 1842, the river was the regular means of transport between Brisbane and Ipswich. The [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]] caused delays to laden vessels until the tide rose sufficiently to pass. From the 1860s, local selectors transported produce by river to Ipswich and Brisbane with tide times influencing the lifestyle of the early farmers. The steamer, \u2018The Fairy\u2019, provided a daily service between Brisbane and Oxley Point (Chelmer) until 1875, when it sank when colliding with another vessel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122071002 |title=THE SINKING OF THE FAIRY. |newspaper=[[Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald And General Advertiser]] |location=Queensland, Australia |date=22 April 1875 |access-date=17 March 2020 |page=4 |via=Trove }}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:StateLibQld_1_132532_Swimmers_cooling_off_in_the_Brisbane_River_at_Chelmer.jpg|thumb|StateLibQld 1 132532 Swimmers cooling off in the Brisbane River at Chelmer]]\n[[File:Major A.

Alexander Boyd, a farmer on Oxley Creek between 1864 and 1870, documented the common occurrence of high floods.The 1893 flood peaked 48 feet above the low tide mark at the Oxley Creek mouth, while upstream, the water rose 20 to 30 feet. The flooded Brisbane River destroyed houses, outbuildings along with farm animals destroying the railway bridge at Oxley Point. As a result of the flood, there was created a beach at Oxley Point, known as \u2018The Sands\u2019 becoming a popular swimming area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanehistory.com/1893_brisbane_flood_intro.html|title=The 1893 flood|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 183451 Rural scene in Oxley Road, Chelmer, Brisbane, in 1906.jpg|thumb|Chelmer Swamp and Oxley Road]]\n\n==== Land Features ====\nSeveral hills, part of a system of low ridges extending from Spring Mountain sixteen miles to the south-west, ranged from 100 to 200 feet.

From these hills, several seasonal steams coursed towards Oxley Creek forming swamps and lagoons. The largest of these swamps was situated south of Oxley Point in present day [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]. In the 1940s it was designated a municipal rubbish dump and the swamp was filled in. It lay where the current sporting grounds are now situated on the eastern side of the Chelmer Station. The hills and ridges on the southern boundary fed other streams such as Bullock Head Creek and Sandy Creek which combined to form Wolston Creek.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nExplorers and early selectors in the area recorded descriptions of the original flora. Oxley\u2019s made account of rich brush along the river, and the settlers of the 1860s referred to the dense scrub which clothed the river and creek banks and giant fig trees grew abundantly. The land\u2019s natural features influenced the lifestyle of the local Aborigines being from Jagarra tribe. This tribe\u2019s habitat lay along the Brisbane River, westwards almost to the Great Dividing Range. They referred to the land on either side of Oxley Creek as Bennawarra. The wildlife of swamps and attracted a section of the tribe known as Yerongapan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n  \nOccasionally, white contact with Aborigines led to clashes. In 1828, at Seventeen Mile Rocks, Aborigines attacked a boat from Limestone Hill, (Ipswich), killing a soldier and a convict. ln 1832, there was a massacre of a convict fishing party on the Brisbane River. By the 1860s, hostilities had ceased in the local area with white settlers being permitted to witness a [[corroboree]] near Oxley Creek. Early selectors found evidence of Aboriginal sites, believing a circular floating island in the large Oxley Point (Chelmer) swamp was a [[Bora (Australian)|bora ring]]. There were other reported areas used as borra rings one being between the Anglican Cemetery and Oxley Creek, and on the site of the [[Corinda railway station]].

Between 1825 and 1829, convicts quarried a portion of Corinda Hill for [[sandstone]], which was used in the construction of the [[Commissariat Store, Brisbane|Commissariat]] and [[The Old Windmill, Brisbane|Windmill]] in the penal colony. This quarry is located at the western point of Quarry Street. In 1851, Thomas Boyland leased land of what became the Shire, where he grazed cattle and sheep. The land became to then be known as Boyland\u2019s Pocket. After Queensland became a colony in 1859, Boyland declined and offer to purchase the land.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Corinda_to_Chelmer_Initial_Landowners_1860s.jpg|thumb|Corinda to Chelmer Initial Landowners 1860s]]\nIn May 1860, the land was subdivided into 25 portions. Each portion averaged 60 acres and initially sold for \u00a31 an acre, the area being eventually known as Oxley West. Between 1861 and 1864, 96 portions of land, were offered for sale in the area known as [[Oxley, Queensland|Oxley]]. In 1851, Lands Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Simpson leased 5,500 acres of land in the south-western section and purchased 640 acres where he erected his home [[Wolston House]], near Wolston Creek. After using the property as a horse stud, he returned to England in 1860 after the death of his nephew, James Ommaney, killed when thrown from a horse while riding on the Wolston property. A hill close to where the fatality occurred was named Mt. Ommaney.

There were three categories of land purchasers during the 1860s: the speculators the immigrant; and immigrants arriving after most of the land had been sold. Speculators included Governor Bowen\u2019s secretary, [[John Bramston (Australian politician)|John Bramston]], who purchased land at Oxley Point and [[Charles Blakeney (politician)|Charles Blakeney]], Frank McDougall and [[Arnold Wienholt]], who served in either the upper or lower houses of the colonial legislature during the 1860s, but did not reside locally.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral immigrants paid their fare to Australia from Britain and on arrival received land orders which equaled the cost of their fares. However, the [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4604131 initial price of land], \u00a31 per acre rose to \u00a33, then to \u00a36, thereby reducing the purchasing power of land orders. Original land purchasers such as Alexander Boyd, William Gray and [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur Francis]] settled on or near elevated land now known as Corinda Hill.\nDespite their farming intentions, Boyd, Gray and Francis lacked experience. Having persevered, their contribution lay outside the local area: Boyd, a school inspector; Gray, a Congregational minister; and Francis, a magistrate. Other original land purchasers being the Strong and Orr families, (Oxley West), and the Lucock and Brodie families, (Oxley), continued to earn their living in the local area as farmers. They instead chose the fertile river and creek flats.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe third category of land purchaser acquired their land from either speculators or selectors. The Berry and [[Sinnamon Farm|Sinnamon]] families who financed their trip from Northern Ireland, initially worked for original settlers, William Gray and William Dart.

Only half the acreage under cane was harvested, because of the effect of severe winters and accompanying frosts. By 1874 however, a disease [[Puccinia melanocephala|referred to as rust]], caused problems having devastated cane crops in Southern Queensland and consequently cane farming in the Oxley Creek district waned. Local farmers, like Joseph Tainton depended on reliable cereal crops and by the 1890s, farmers had added [[Dairy|dairying]] to their activities, continuing into the early 1900s.

Thomas Berry senior noted the hot summer of 1863, when the temperature in Fahrenheit averaged 95 degrees in the shade and 135 degrees outside. There was a drought in 1877 and pressure was put on the State Government to build a water reservoir in the Sherwood area.

The tragic and depressing aspect of pioneering life involved the loss of children at birth or in the months following. This was put down to the lack of pre-natal care and the scarcity of milk which contributed to problems after the birth of a child. The loss of children in infancy had a prolonged effect on Angela Francis. She was motivated to establish a mid-wife training scheme for women in isolated areas. On another occasion, to prevent the possibility of naive female migrants succumbing to the adverse influences of urban life, Angela Francis trained several young females as governesses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1863 the residents presented a petition to government signed by 30 residents, called for the construction of a bridge over Oxley Creek which had the effect of halving the distance to the Brisbane markets.

The government responded by building another bridge from Sherwood over Oxley Creek in 1864, one mile from its mouth and in 1865, a road linked this bridge to Rocky Waterholes ([[Rocklea, Queensland|Rocklea]]).

In 1873, a new hotel was constructed at the intersection of present day Ipswich and Oxley Roads. In 1889, 23 residents, in their petition expressed their objection that the new Oxley hotel, in addition to its Liquor licence, also had a [[Music hall|Music Hall]] licence.

From then on, the raids intensified, being launched regularly until the end of the war. The attacks succeeded in devastating most large Japanese cities (with the exception of Kyoto and several others), and they gravely damaged Japan's war industries. Although less publicly appreciated, the mining of Japanese ports and shipping routes ([[Operation Starvation]]) carried out by B-29s from April 1945 reduced Japan's ability to support its population and move its troops.\n\n====The atomic bombs====\nPerhaps the most famous B-29s were the sixty-five examples of the [[Silverplate]] series, which were modified to drop [[nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].

Tibbets for the mission, straight off the assembly line at the [[Offutt Air Force Base#Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant|Omaha plant]] that was to become [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The Silverplate bombers differed from other B-29s then in service by having [[fuel injection]] and [[Variable-pitch propeller|reversible props]].

At first, the bomber was used in normal strategic day-bombing missions, though North Korea's few strategic targets and industries were quickly destroyed. More importantly, in 1950 numbers of Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] jet fighters appeared over Korea, and after the loss of 28 aircraft, future B-29 raids were restricted to night-only missions, largely in a supply-interdiction role.\n\nThe B-29 dropped the 1,000-lb VB-3 \"Razon\" (a range-controllable version of the earlier [[Azon]] guided ordnance device)<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/MuseumExhibits/FactSheets/Display/tabid/509/Article/196093/vb-3-razon-bomb.aspx NMUSAF page on the VB-3 ''Razon'' ordnance]</ref> and the 12,000 lb.

B-29 gunners were credited with shooting down 27 enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Futrell\">Futrell et al. 1976.</ref> In turn 78 B-29 were lost; 57 B-29 and reconnaissance variants were lost in action and 21 were non-combat losses.<ref>[https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Stats/USAF_Losses_Korea.htm USAF losses during the Korean War. USAF Statistical Digest FY1953]</ref>\n\nSoviet records show that one MiG-15 jet fighter was shot down by a B-29 during the war. This occurred on 6 December 1950, when a B-29 shot down Lieutenant N. Serikov.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130604071241/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_315.shtml</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the mammoth [[Convair B-36]], the B-29 was reclassified as a medium bomber by the Air Force. However, the later [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50 Superfortress]] variant (initially designated [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#B-29|B-29D]]) was good enough to handle auxiliary roles such as [[air-sea rescue]], electronic intelligence gathering, [[Aerial refueling|air-to-air refueling]], and [[weather reconnaissance]].\n\nThe B-50D was replaced in its primary role during the early 1950s by the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]], which in turn was replaced by the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]. The final active-duty KB-50 and WB-50 variants were phased out in the mid-1960s, with the final example retired in 1965. A total of 3,970 B-29s were built.\n\n==Variants==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2017}}<!--only one reference-->\n{{Main|Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants}}\n[[File:Bell X-1 in the belly of a B-29.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bell X-1]] and its B-29 mother ship]]\nThe variants of the B-29 were outwardly similar in appearance but were in fact built around different wing center sections that affected the wingspan dimensions. The wing of the Renton built B-29A-BN used a different subassembly process and was a foot longer in span. The Georgia built B-29B-BA weighed less through armament reduction. A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built.\n\nMoreover, engine packages changed; including the type of propellers and range of the variable pitch. A notable example were the eventual 65 airframes (up to 1947's end) for the [[Silverplate]] and successor-name \"Saddletree\" specifications; built for the [[Manhattan Project]] with Curtiss Electric reversible pitch propellers.\n\nThe other differences came about through added equipment for varied mission roles. These roles included cargo carriers (CB); rescue aircraft (SB); weather ships (WB); and trainers (TB); and aerial tankers (KB).\n\nSome were used for odd purposes such as flying relay television transmitters under the name of [[Stratovision]].\n[[File:Boeing WB-29A 53 WRS 1954.jpg|thumb|right|WB-29A of the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in 1954 showing the fuselage-top observation station]]\n\nThe B-29D led progressively to the XB-44, and the family of '''[[B-50 Superfortress]]''' (which was powered by four {{convert|3500|hp|abbr=on}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]]-35 Wasp Major engines).\n\nAnother role was as a mothership. This included being rigged for carrying the experimental [[parasite fighter]] aircraft, such as the [[McDonnell XF-85 Goblin]] and [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]]s as in flight lock on and offs. It was also used to develop the [[Airborne Early Warning]] program; it was the ancestor of various modern radar picket aircraft. A B-29 with the original Wright Duplex Cyclone powerplants was used to air-launch the famous [[Bell X-1]] supersonic research rocket aircraft, as well as [[Cherokee (rocket)|Cherokee]] rockets for the testing of ejection seats.<ref name=\"Ala\">Shinabery, Michael.

Named in allusion to its predecessor, the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]], the Superfortress was designed for high-altitude [[strategic bomber|strategic bombing]] but also excelled in low-altitude night [[incendiary bomb]]ing, and in dropping [[naval mine]]s to blockade Japan. B-29s also dropped the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], becoming the only bomber to ever used [[nuclear weapon]]ry in [[combat]].\n\nOne of the largest aircraft of World War II, the B-29 had [[state of the art|state-of-the-art]] technology, including a [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized cabin]]; dual-wheeled, tricycle landing gear; and an [[analog computer]]-controlled [[fire-control system]] that allowed one gunner and a fire-control officer to direct four remote machine gun turrets.

Budge|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe B-29's advanced design allowed it to remain in service in various roles throughout the 1950s. The type was retired in the early 1960s, after 3,970 had been built.\n\nA few were used as flying television transmitters by the [[Stratovision]] company. The [[Royal Air Force]] flew the B-29 as the ''Washington'' until 1954.\n\nThe B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing-built bombers, transports, tankers, reconnaissance aircraft and trainers. The re-engined [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50 Superfortress]] became [[Lucky Lady II|the first aircraft to fly around the world non-stop]], during a 94-hour flight in 1949. The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] airlifter, first flown in 1944, was followed in 1947 by its commercial airliner variant, the Boeing [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser|Model 377 Stratocruiser]]. This bomber-to-airliner derivation was similar to the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]/[[Boeing 307|Model 307]] evolution. In 1948, Boeing introduced the [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29]] tanker, followed in 1950 by the Model 377-derivative [[Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker|KC-97]]. A line of outsized-cargo variants of the Stratocruiser is the [[Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy|Guppy]]{{\\}}[[Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy|Mini Guppy]]{{\\}}[[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy|Super Guppy]], which remain in service with [[NASA]] and other operators.\n\nThe Soviet Union produced an unlicensed [[reverse-engineered]] copy, the [[Tupolev Tu-4]].\n\nMore than twenty B-29s remain as static displays but only two, [[FIFI (aircraft)|''Fifi'']] and [[Doc (aircraft)|''Doc'']], still fly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mcconnell.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/842055/b-29-doc-takes-to-the-skies-from-mcconnell/|title=B-29 'Doc' takes to the skies from McConnell|last=Waller|first=Staff Sgt.

Boeing's design study for the Model 334 was a pressurized derivative of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] with [[tricycle landing gear|nosewheel undercarriage]]. Although the Air Corps did not have money to pursue the design, Boeing continued development with its own funds as a private venture.<ref name=\"Bowers Boeing p318\">Bowers 1989, p. 318.</ref> In April 1939, [[Charles Lindbergh]] convinced general [[Henry H.

The need for pressurization in the cockpit area also led to the B-29 being one of very few American combat aircraft of World War II to have a [[Stepless (aircraft)|stepless]] cockpit design, without a separate windscreen for the pilots.\n\nManufacturing the B-29 was a complex task. It involved four main-assembly factories: a pair of Boeing operated plants at [[Renton, Washington]] ([[Boeing Renton Factory|Boeing Renton]]), and [[Wichita, Kansas]] (now [[Spirit AeroSystems]]), a [[Bell Aircraft Corporation|Bell]] plant at [[Marietta, Georgia]] near [[Atlanta]] (\"Bell-Atlanta\"), and a [[Glenn L.

AAF-contracted modification centers and its own air depot system struggled to handle the scope of the requirements. Some facilities lacked hangars capable of housing the giant B-29, requiring outdoor work in freezing cold weather, further delaying necessary modification. By the end of 1943, although almost 100 aircraft had been delivered, only 15 were airworthy.<ref name=\"iapr22 p144\">Willis 2007, p. 144.</ref><ref name=\"Peacock1 p76\">Peacock ''Air International'' August 1989, p. 76.</ref> This prompted an intervention by General [[Henry H. Arnold|Hap Arnold]] to resolve the problem, with production personnel being sent from the factories to the modification centers to speed availability of sufficient aircraft to equip the first [[group (air force unit)|Bomb Groups]] in what became known as the \"[[Battle of Kansas]]\". This resulted in 150 aircraft being modified in the five weeks between 10 March and 15 April 1944.<ref name=\"Knaack p484\">Knaack 1988, p. 484.</ref><ref name=\"Bowers Boeing p323\">Bowers 1989, p. 323.</ref><ref>Herman 2012, pp. 284\u2013346.</ref>\n\nThe most common cause of maintenance headaches and catastrophic failures were the engines.<ref name=\"Knaack p484\"/> Although the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone]] [[radial engine]]s later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston-engined aircraft, early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems. This problem was not fully cured until the aircraft was fitted with the more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major|Pratt & Whitney R-4360 \"Wasp Major\"]] in the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#B-29|B-29D]]/B-50 program, which arrived too late for [[World War II]]. Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. Oil flow to the valves was also increased, [[asbestos]] baffles installed around rubber [[push rod]] fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough [[pre-flight inspection]]s made to detect unseated valves, and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).{{refn|As efforts were made to eradicate the problems a succession of engine models were fitted to B-29s. B-29 production started with the \u221223, which were all modified to the \"war engine\" \u221223A.

[[Radial engine]]s need airflow to keep them cool, and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.<ref name=\"gardiner\">Gardner, Fred Carl [http://www.oregoncounsel.com/FAAACE/Superfortress.html \"A Year in the B-29 Superfortress.\"] ''Fred Carl Gardner's website'', updated 1 May 2005.

At first, the bomber was used in normal strategic day-bombing missions, though North Korea's few strategic targets and industries were quickly destroyed. More importantly, in 1950 numbers of Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] jet fighters appeared over Korea, and after the loss of 28 aircraft, future B-29 raids were restricted to night-only missions, largely in a supply-interdiction role.\n\nThe B-29 dropped the 1,000-lb VB-3 \"Razon\" (a range-controllable version of the earlier [[Azon]] guided ordnance device)<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/MuseumExhibits/FactSheets/Display/tabid/509/Article/196093/vb-3-razon-bomb.aspx NMUSAF page on the VB-3 ''Razon'' ordnance]</ref> and the 12,000 lb.

B-29 gunners were credited with shooting down 27 enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Futrell\">Futrell et al. 1976.</ref> In turn 78 B-29 were lost; 57 B-29 and reconnaissance variants were lost in action and 21 were non-combat losses.<ref>[https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Stats/USAF_Losses_Korea.htm USAF losses during the Korean War.

However, the later [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50 Superfortress]] variant (initially designated [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#B-29|B-29D]]) was good enough to handle auxiliary roles such as [[air-sea rescue]], electronic intelligence gathering, [[Aerial refueling|air-to-air refueling]], and [[weather reconnaissance]].\n\nThe B-50D was replaced in its primary role during the early 1950s by the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]], which in turn was replaced by the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]. The final active-duty KB-50 and WB-50 variants were phased out in the mid-1960s, with the final example retired in 1965. A total of 3,970 B-29s were built.\n\n==Variants==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2017}}<!--only one reference-->\n{{Main|Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants}}\n[[File:Bell X-1 in the belly of a B-29.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bell X-1]] and its B-29 mother ship]]\nThe variants of the B-29 were outwardly similar in appearance but were in fact built around different wing center sections that affected the wingspan dimensions. The wing of the Renton built B-29A-BN used a different subassembly process and was a foot longer in span. The Georgia built B-29B-BA weighed less through armament reduction. A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built.\n\nMoreover, engine packages changed; including the type of propellers and range of the variable pitch. A notable example were the eventual 65 airframes (up to 1947's end) for the [[Silverplate]] and successor-name \"Saddletree\" specifications; built for the [[Manhattan Project]] with Curtiss Electric reversible pitch propellers.\n\nThe other differences came about through added equipment for varied mission roles. These roles included cargo carriers (CB); rescue aircraft (SB); weather ships (WB); and trainers (TB); and aerial tankers (KB).\n\nSome were used for odd purposes such as flying relay television transmitters under the name of [[Stratovision]].\n[[File:Boeing WB-29A 53 WRS 1954.jpg|thumb|right|WB-29A of the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in 1954 showing the fuselage-top observation station]]\n\nThe B-29D led progressively to the XB-44, and the family of '''[[B-50 Superfortress]]''' (which was powered by four {{convert|3500|hp|abbr=on}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]]-35 Wasp Major engines).\n\nAnother role was as a mothership. This included being rigged for carrying the experimental [[parasite fighter]] aircraft, such as the [[McDonnell XF-85 Goblin]] and [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]]s as in flight lock on and offs. It was also used to develop the [[Airborne Early Warning]] program; it was the ancestor of various modern radar picket aircraft.
