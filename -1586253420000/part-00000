In the early 1930s he moved to the Jewish autonomous region of [[Birobidzhan]] on the [[Amur River]], where he became the chairman of a local [[kolkhoz]] and also ran a theatre. During these years he began writing and publishing poems and stories in Yiddish. In 1941 he was in Moscow, taking part in the defence efforts of the capital and later joining the regular [[Red Army]] for frontier service. His war service brought him close to some of the major battles of 1943-45 and finally into the battle for Berlin; by this time he had become assistant director of intelligence in one of the armies involved.\n\n===Career===\nAfter 1945 Kazakevich began writing in Russian, and his debut novel ''Zvezda'' (The star, 1947, adapted into a film in 1949 (remake - [[The Star (2002 film)|film]] 2002)) was an instant success. The novel describes an army intelligence unit during WW2 and their raid behind enemy lines. The book showcases some of his later recurrent traits: the sharp, lyrical evocation of nature, the interest in moral conflicts and ambiguities, often relating to the transition between war and peace, the sense of humour and psychological observation. Many of his later stories are set during or shortly after the Second World War. The novella \"In the Light of Day\" (1960) explores ambiguities of guilt, bravery and memory as a soldier makes a visit to the widow of his fallen friend and unit officer.\n\nDuring the fifties, Kazakevich reached high positions in the Soviet Association of Writers and was aligned with the efforts of de-Stalinization. He kept picking up potentially sensitive subjects, and during his last years may have been working on a major novel about [[Lenin]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolutionary]] years. The short novel ''Sinyaya tetrad'' ([[The Blue notebook]]) appeared in 1961; it is set during Lenin's stay on the [[Karelia]]n isthmus in the summer of 1917 and brings Lenin face to face both with ordinary people and with [[Grigory Zinovyev]], who was still considered a traitor or at best a dubious figure at the time of writing. While Kazakevich, in the end, makes Lenin refute Zinovyev's fears and allegations, there is no attempt to show the latter as an evil or insincere person, which would have been a given for most Soviet writers at the time.\n\nKazakevich continued with Lenin as a main character in another story, \"Enemies\", written in his last year, and it is likely that he was planning to bring them together within a larger novel about Lenin. However, his sudden passing away in the summer of 1962 meant that those plans were left unfulfilled.\n\n==Works==\n;English translations\n*''Star: A Story'', Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1952.\n*''Heart of a Friend: A Story'', Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1952.\n*''Hungarian meetings'', - his travel notes on Russian, 1955 (The Hungarian Revolution was in 1956).\n*''The House on the Square'', Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1957.\n*''Selected Works'', Progress Publishers, 1978.\n*''The Blue Notebook'', Fredonia Books, 2002.\n\n==References==\n* Kazakevich, Emmanuil: ''Den bl\u00e5 anteckningsboken'' (\"The Blue Notebook and two other stories\"), translated into Swedish by H.

{"title_page": "Orange\u2013Fish River Tunnel", "text_new": "[[File:Sunset at Oviston Gariep photo by Siloam Village.JPG|thumb|Sunset at Oviston Lake Gariep]]\n[[File:Oviston Orange Fish Tunnel Siloam Village Gariep Karoo.jpg|thumb|Orange Fish Tunnel Oviston]]\nThe '''Orange\u2013Fish Tunnel''' is a 50 mile long irrigation [[tunnel]] in central [[South Africa]], built to divert water from the Orange River to the Fish River valley. It is the longest continuous enclosed aqueduct in the southern hemisphere.\n\n== Purpose ==\nFor many years, large areas in the [[Eastern Cape]] experienced severe water shortages because of little [[rainfall]] in the arid [[Karoo]]. The situation was aggravated by the reduction in capacity of many of the existing [[dam]]s due to heavy silt deposits.\n\nThe Project to alleviate this situation comprised two inter-dependent engineering schemes - neither of which was any use without the other.  First, a dam had to be built across the Orange River; and then a tunnel had to be driven to take the water across the water-shed into another river system.  The Orange-Fish Tunnel, together with its network of canals, weirs and balancing dams, has enabled these areas to be restored and has made the irrigation of thousands of hectares of additional land possible. The main purpose of the tunnel is to divert water from the [[Gariep Dam]] to the [[Eastern Cape]] for irrigation, household and industrial use.\n\n==Route==\nThe tunnel diverts water from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Great Fish River]] and the semi-arid areas of [[Eastern Cape]] province.  The Orange River is the largest river in South Africa by volume, and the longest. It rises in the [[Drakensberg Mountains]] of [[Lesotho]] and flows Westwards through increasingly drier country to discharge into the South Atlantic at Oranjemund, where, through evaporation and abstraction,  the volume was less than it was at the location of the [[Gariep Dam]].\n\nThe inlet tower at {{coord|30|41|26|S|25|45|46|E|type:landmark|display=inline}} takes water from the [[Gariep Dam]] at [[Oviston]]:  the name ''Oviston'' is an acronym based on the [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] ''Oranje-VISrivier TONnel''. After traversing due South under the Suurberg mountain plateau, it releases the water to the [[Teebus Spruit]] (tunnel outlet at {{coord|31|25|22.5|S|25|38|14|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}), to the [[Groot Brak River (Eastern Cape)|Groot Brak River]] and onwards to the valleys of the [[Great Fish River]] and the [[Sundays River]].<ref>http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Orange-River-Tunnel-lining-film/</ref>\n\nThe tunnel is on what is called a \"self-cleansing\" gradient of 2% from North to South.  During construction, South Africa changed over from \"Imperial\" measurement to the [[Metric System]], but special dispensation was made for this Project to use Imperial measure throughout, which was half-built at the time.\n\n== Construction ==\nConstruction started in 1966; preliminary works included a tarred road running along the rout of the tunnel, and three towns, Oviston at the North end, one in the one middle called \"Mid-shaft\", and \"Teebus\" at the South end.   These towns included such facilities as a Clubhouse, tennis courts, a community hall, primary school, clinic, etc..  At Oviston there was also a power station to provide electricity to the tunnels and to the towns.  Other facilities included Contractor's yards, a testing laboratory, and offices for the staff.\n\nThe tunnel is 19'-6\" in finished diameter, with a 9\" thick mass concrete lining.  The ground was excavated entirely by the drill-and-blast technique, and was tested both by flood and by fire.<ref>http://s3.spanglefish.com/s/27932/documents/civil-engineering/anticipating-the-unexpected-flood-fire-overbreak-collapse/anticipating-the-unexpected-flood-fire-overbreak-collapse.pdf</ref>\n\nThe lining was done using a travelling shutter - concrete arrived first thing Monday morning, and continued unstopped until Saturday afternoon.  The concrete mix was specially developed for the project, and the \"cement\" content was 50% Slagment a.k.a. PFA ([[Pulverised Fuel Ash]]).  The mix contained retarders to enable the concrete to be placed up to six hours after mixing, and it also contained accelerators, to enable the shutter to be moved after only eighteen hours. The speed of the shutter was about 1000 ft a week.\n\nThe tunnel has a finished diameter of {{convert|5.35|m|ft|1}} and ranges in depth between {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} and {{convert|380|m|ft|0}}.<ref>{{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Barry R. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Hazardous gases underground: applications to tunnel engineering | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 201 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8247-0483-4 }}</ref> It is on a gradient of 1:2000.<ref>http://www.spanglefish.com/miscellany/index.asp?pageid=382305</ref>\n\nIt was engineered by the British firm of Consulting Engineers, Sir William Halcrow & Partners, in association with Messrs Keeve Steyn and Partners of Johannesburg.

When completed the tunnel's length of 83&nbsp;km was the longest continuous enclosed aqueduct in the southern hemisphere and the second-longest water supply tunnel in the world.
