Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities.\n\n[[Americanization]] policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States (American) customs and values, they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society.  After the end of the [[Indian Wars]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies.  It established [[Native American boarding schools]] which children were required to attend. In these schools they were forced to speak English, study standard subjects, attend church, and leave tribal traditions behind.\n\nThe [[Dawes Act|Dawes Act of 1887]], which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals, was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans.  Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions.  It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of {{convert|93|e6acre|km2}} from Native American control.  Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals.  The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations.  The leading opponent of forced assimilation was [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies. So I hold up my balloons and watch them float away I can feel them weighing on me every day.\n\n==Europeans and Native Americans in North America, 1601\u20131776==\n\n[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern North America; the 1763 \"Proclamation line\" is the border between the red and the pink areas.]]\n[[Epidemiological]] and [[archeological]] work has established the effects of increased immigration of children accompanying families to North America from 1634\u20131640.  They came from areas where [[smallpox]] was endemic in the Netherlands, England and France, and passed on the disease to indigenous people.  Tribes such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]/[[Wyandot people|Wendat]] and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634.<ref name=\"Warrick\">Gary Warrick, \"European Infectious Disease and Depopulation of the Wendat-Tionontate (Huron-Petun)\", ''World Archaeology'' 35 (October 2003), 258\u2013275.</ref>\n\nDuring this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America, just as they were doing in Europe. At the same time, indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas.  The French, English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies, otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles.  In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces, which deepened some of their rivalries.  To secure the help of the tribes, the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties. The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribe's traditional lands and independence.  In addition, the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons, wanting to keep allies in the fur and [[gun]] trades, positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes, etc.  Many Native American tribes took part in [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131697), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702\u20131713) ([[War of the Spanish Succession]]), [[Dummer's War]] (c. 1721\u20131725), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763) ([[Seven Years' War]]).\n\nAs the dominant power after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain instituted the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], to try to protect indigenous peoples' territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community.  In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward.  The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists.  Europeans and European governments continued to use military/diplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans. For further information see [[European colonization of the Americas]].\n\nFrom the Native American perspective, European control of an area generally means a dramatic change in their way of life, with free movement across hunting grounds curtailed or objected to, for instance, by Europeans who had different conceptions of property and the uses of land.\n\n==The United States and Native Americans, 1776\u20131860==\n[[File:Benjamin Hawkins and the Creek Indians.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]] demonstrating European methods of farming to [[Creek (people)|Creek]] (Muscogee) on his Georgia plantation situated along the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]], 1805]]\n\nThe struggle for empire in [[North America]] caused the [[United States]] in its earliest years to adopt an Indian policy similar to the one devised by [[Great Britain]] in colonial times.<ref name=\"fritz\">Fritz, Henry E. (1963).  ''The Movement for Indian in 1860\u20131890''.  University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> They realized that good relations with bordering tribes were important for political and trading reasons, but as had the British, they reserved the right to abandon these good relations to absorb the lands of their enemies and allies alike as the agricultural frontier moved west. The United States continued the use of Native Americans as allies, including during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]]. As relations with England and Spain normalized during the early 19th century, the need for such friendly relations ended. It was no longer necessary to \"woo\" the tribes to prevent the other powers from using them against the United States.  Now, instead of a buffer against other \"civilized\" foes, the tribes often became viewed as an obstacle in the expansion of the United States.\n\nGeorge Washington formulated a policy to encourage the \"civilizing\" process.<ref name=\"remini_reform_begins\" /> He had a six-point plan for civilization which included:\n\n# impartial justice toward Native Americans\n# regulated buying of Native American lands\n# promotion of commerce\n# promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society\n# presidential authority to give presents\n# punishing those who violated Native American rights.<ref name=eric_miller>\n{{cite book\n|chapterurl        = http://www.dreric.org/library/northwest.shtml\n|title      = George Washington And Indians\n |accessdate=2008-05-02\n|last       = Miller\n|first      = Eric\n|year       = 1994\n|chapter    = Washington and the Northwest War, Part One\n|publisher  = Eric Miller\n}}\n</ref>\n\nRobert Remini, a historian, wrote that \"once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans\".<ref name=remini_submit_adoption>\n{{cite book\n|last      = Remini\n|first     = Robert\n|title     = Andrew Jackson\n|origyear  = 1977, 1998\n |publisher=History Book Club\n|chapter   = \"Brothers, Listen ...

But it has been conceived to be impracticable to civilize the Indians of North America \u2013 This opinion is probably more convenient than just.|Henry Knox to George Washington, 1790s.<ref name=eric_miller/>}}\n\n===Indian removal===\nThe [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 characterized the US government policy of [[Indian removal]], which called for relocation of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river. While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes, it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission, though it was often ignored.\n\nOn September 27, 1830, the [[Choctaws]] signed [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed. The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory.\n\nWhile the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary, it was often abused by government officials.  The best-known example is the [[Treaty of New Echota]].  It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of [[Cherokee]] tribal members, not the tribal leadership, on December 29, 1835. While tribal leaders objected to Washington, DC and the treaty was revised in 1836, the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838.<ref>Hoxie, Frederick (1984). ''A Final Promise: The Campaign to Assimilate the Indians, 1880\u20131920''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.</ref> An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died in the march, now known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nIn the decades that followed, white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans. American settlers eventually made homesteads from coast to coast, just as the Native Americans had before them. No tribe was untouched by the influence of white traders, farmers, and soldiers.\n\n===Office of Indian Affairs===\nThe Office of Indian Affairs ([[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as of 1947) was established on March 11, 1824, as an office of the [[United States Department of War]], an indication of the state of relations with the Indians. It became responsible for negotiating treaties and enforcing conditions, at least for Native Americans. In 1849 the bureau was transferred to the [[Department of the Interior]] as so many of its responsibilities were related to the holding and disposition of large land assets.\n\nIn 1854 Commissioner [[George W. Manypenny]] called for a new code of regulations. He noted that there was no place in the West where the Indians could be placed with a reasonable hope that they might escape conflict with white settlers. He also called for the Intercourse Law of 1834 to be revised, as its provisions had been aimed at individual intruders on Indian territory rather than at organized expeditions.\n\nIn 1858 the succeeding Commissioner, [[Charles Mix]], noted that the repeated removal of tribes had prevented them from acquiring a taste for European way of life. In 1862 Secretary of the Interior [[Caleb B. Smith]] questioned the wisdom of treating tribes as quasi-independent nations.<ref name=\"fritz\" /> Given the difficulties of the government in what it considered good efforts to support separate status for Native Americans, appointees and officials began to consider a policy of Americanization instead.\n\n==Americanization and assimilation (1857\u20131920)==\n{{see also|Federal Indian Policy#Allotment and assimilation era (1887\u20131943)}}\n[[File:Portrait of Marsdin, Non-Native Man, and Group of Students SEP 1893.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Portrait of Marsdin, non-native man, and group of students from the Alaska region]]\nThe movement to reform Indian administration and assimilate Indians as citizens originated in the pleas of people who lived in close association with the natives and were shocked by the fraudulent and indifferent management of their affairs. They called themselves \"Friends of the Indian\" and lobbied officials on their behalf.  Gradually the call for change was taken up by Eastern reformers.<ref name=\"fritz\" />  Typically the reformers were Protestants from well organized denominations who considered assimilation necessary to the Christianizing of the Indians; Catholics were also involved.  The 19th century was a time of major efforts in evangelizing missionary expeditions to all non-Christian people.  In 1865 the government began to make contracts with various missionary societies to operate Indian schools for teaching citizenship, English, and agricultural and mechanical arts.<ref>Robert H. Keller, ''American Protestantism and United States Indian Policy, 1869-82'' (1983)</ref>\n\n===Grant's \"Peace Policy\"===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\n{{see|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}\n\nIn his State of the Union Address on December 4, 1871, [[Ulysses Grant]] stated that \"the policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably ... many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination.\"<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/state-of-the-union/83.html</ref> The emphasis became using civilian workers (not soldiers) to deal with reservation life, especially Protestant and Catholic organizations. The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation. Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems, such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted.<ref>Cary C. Collins, \"A Fall From Grace: Sectarianism and the Grant Peace Policy in Western Washington Territory, 1869\u20131882\", ''Pacific Northwest Forum'' (1995) 8#2 pp 55\u201377</ref>\n\nThe Quakers were motivated by high ideals, played down the role of conversion, and worked well with the Indians. They had been highly organized and motivated by the anti-slavery crusade, and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both ex-slaves and the western tribes. They had Grant's ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy. During 1869\u20131885, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.<ref>Joseph E. Illick, \"'Some Of Our Best Friends Are Indians...': Quaker Attitudes and Actions Regarding the Western Indians during the Grant Administration\", ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1971) 2#3 pp. 283\u2013294 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/967835 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nMany other denominations volunteered to help. In 1871, John H. Stout, sponsored by the Dutch Reformed Church, was sent to the [[Gila River Indian Community|Pima reservation]] in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated at every turn.<ref>Robert A. Trennert, \"John H. Stout and the Grant Peace Policy among the Pimas\", ''Arizona & the West'' (1986) 28#1 pp. 45\u201368</ref>\n\nIn Arizona and New Mexico, the Navajo were resettled on reservations and grew rapidly in numbers. The Peace Policy began in 1870 when the Presbyterians took over the reservations. They were frustrated because they did not understand the Navajo.  However, the Navajo not only gave up raiding but soon became successful at sheep ranching.<ref>Norman Bender, ''New Hope for the Indians: The Grant Peace Policy and the Navajos in the 1870s'' (1989)</ref>\n\nThe peace policy did not fully apply to the Indian tribes that had supported the Confederacy. They lost much of their land as the United States began to confiscate the western portions of the Indian Territory and began to resettle the Indians there on smaller reservations.<ref>https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oklahoma/</ref>\n\nReaction to the massacre of Lt. Col. George Custer's unit at the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.<ref>Brian W. Dippie, {{\"'}}What Will Congress Do About It?' The Congressional Reaction to the Little Big Horn Disaster\", ''North Dakota History'' (1970) 37#3 pp. 161\u2013189</ref>\n\n===Code of Indian Offenses===\nIn 1882, Interior Secretary [[Henry M. Teller]] called attention to the \"great hindrance\" of Indian customs to the progress of assimilation.  The resultant \"Code of Indian Offenses\" in 1883 outlined the procedure for suppressing \"evil practice.\"\n\nA Court of Indian Offenses, consisting of three Indians appointed by the Indian Agent, was to be established at each Indian agency.  The Court would serve as judges to punish offenders.  Outlawed behavior included participation in traditional dances and feasts, polygamy, reciprocal gift giving and funeral practices, and intoxication or sale of liquor.  Also prohibited were \"medicine men\" who \"use any of the arts of the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their heathenish rites and customs.\"  The penalties prescribed for violations ranged from 10 to 90 days imprisonment and loss of government-provided rations for up to 30 days.<ref>http://rcliton.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/code-of-indian-offenses.pdf, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Five Civilized Tribes]] were exempt from the Code which remained in effect until 1933.<ref>http://tribal-law.blogspot.com/2008/02/code-of-indian-offenses.html, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nIn implementation on reservations by Indian judges, the Court of Indian Offenses became mostly an institution to punish minor crimes.  The 1890 report of the Secretary of the Interior lists the activities of the Court on several reservations and apparently no Indian was prosecuted for dances or \"heathenish ceremonies.\"<ref>''Report of the Secretary of the Interior'', Volume II. Washington: GPO, 189, pp. lxxxiii-lxxxix.</ref>    Significantly, 1890 was the year of the [[Ghost Dance]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].\n\n=== The role of the Supreme Court in assimilation ===\nIn 1857, Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] expressed that since Native Americans were \"free and independent people\" that they could become U.S. citizens.<ref name=chiefJustic_taney>\n{{cite web\n| url        = http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/82-1/Hoxie.pdf\n| title      = What was Taney thinking?

Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. New York: St. Martin's. 2001. (178) Print.</ref>).

The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (191) Print.</ref>  Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts.  The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness.  Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure for every American.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\"/>  These ideas can be seen in the decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era.\n\nCases such as [[Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]], [[Talton v. Mayes]], [[Winters vs. The United States]], [[United States v. Winans]], [[United States v. Nice]], and [[United States v. Sandoval]] provide excellent examples of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as they refer back to the idea of Indians as \"wards of the nation\".<ref>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=187&invol=553</ref> Some other issues that came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives, especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices, whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians, and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws. As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans, the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions.  Native American nations were labeled \"domestic dependent nations\" by Marshall in [[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]], one of the first landmark cases involving Indians.<ref>Duthu, Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Books, 2008. (XXV) Print.</ref> Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes, while others preserved tribal sovereignty, while still others sometimes managed to do both.\n\n== Decisions focusing on dependence ==\n\n===''United States vs. Kagama''===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'' (1886) set the stage for the court to make even more powerful decisions based on plenary power.  To summarize congressional plenary power, the court stated:\n\n{{quote|The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, is necessary to their protection, as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell. It must exist in that government, because it never has existed anywhere else; because the theater of its exercise is within the geographical limits of the United [118 U.S. 375, 385] States; because it has never been denied; and because it alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=118&invol=375 \"United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886)\"]. Findlaw. Retrieved on 2009-10-19.</ref>}}\n\nThe decision in ''United States v. Kagama'' led to the new idea that \"protection\" of Native Americans could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs. The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation of Native Americans into American society.<ref name=\"Mask\"/>\n\n===''United States v. Nice''===\nDuring the years leading up to passage of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]], ''United States v. Nice'' (1916), was a result of the idea of barring American Indians from the sale of [[liquor]]. The United States Supreme Court case overruled a decision made eleven years before, ''Matter of Heff'', {{ussc|197|48|1905}}, which allowed American Indian U.S. citizens to drink liquor.<ref name=\"UG\"/> The quick reversal shows how law concerning American Indians often shifted with the changing governmental and popular views of American Indian tribes.<ref>Canby Jr., William. ''American Indian Law In a Nut Shell,'' 4th edition. West Group, 2004. (1) Print.</ref> The US Congress continued to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. While many tribal governments had long prohibited the sale of alcohol on their reservations, the ruling implied that American Indian nations could not be entirely independent, and needed a guardian for protection.\n\n===''United States v. Sandoval''===\nLike ''United States v. Nice,'' the United States Supreme Court case of ''[[United States v. Sandoval]]'' (1913) rose from efforts to bar American Indians from the sale of liquor.  As American Indians were granted citizenship, there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was distinct from regular citizens.  The Sandoval Act reversed the ''U.S. v. Joseph'' decision of 1876, which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians. The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were \"not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution\".<ref>''Red Man's Land White Man's Land'' 2nd edition, Wilcomb B. Washburn, 1995,\np. 141</ref> This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. The ruling continued to suggest that American Indians needed protection.\n\n== Decisions focusing on sovereignty ==\nThere were several United States Supreme Court cases during the assimilation era that focused on the [[sovereignty]] of American Indian nations.  These cases were extremely important in setting precedents for later cases and for legislation dealing with the sovereignty of American Indian nations.\n\n===''Ex parte Crow Dog'' (1883)===\n''[[Ex parte Crow Dog]]'' was a US Supreme Court appeal by an Indian who had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.  The defendant was an American Indian who had been found guilty of the murder of another American Indian.  [[Crow Dog]] argued that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed between two American Indians that happened on an American Indian reservation.  The court found that although the reservation was located within the territory covered by the district court's jurisdiction, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2146 precluded the inmate's indictment in the district court. Section 2146 stated that Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2145, which made the criminal laws of the United States applicable to Indian country, did not apply to crimes committed by one Indian against another, or to crimes for which an Indian was already punished by the law of his tribe.  The Court issued the writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and ''certiorari'' to the Indian.<ref>''Ex parte Crow Dog'', {{ussc|109|556|1883}}</ref>\n\n===''Talton v. Mayes'' (1896)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Talton v. Mayes]]'' was a decision respecting the authority of tribal governments. This case decided that the individual rights protections, specifically the Fifth Amendment, which limit federal, and later, state governments, do not apply to tribal government. It reaffirmed earlier decisions, such as the 1831 ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' case, that gave Indian tribes the status of \"domestic dependent nations\", the sovereignty of which is independent of the federal government.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/163/376/case.html \"Full text opinion from Justia.com\"]</ref> ''Talton v. Mayes'' is also a case dealing with Native American dependence, as it deliberated over and upheld the concept of congressional plenary authority. This part of the decision led to some important pieces of legislation concerning Native Americans, the most important of which is the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n===''Good Shot v. United States'' (1900)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case occurred when an American Indian shot and killed a non-Indian. The question arose of whether or not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue. In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of [[certiorari]]. This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.<ref>\"Good Shot v. United States''. LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''Montoya v. United States'' (1901)===\nThis United States Supreme court case came about when the surviving partner of the firm of E. Montoya & Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880. It was believed that the livestock was taken by \"Victorio's Band\"  which was a group of these American Indians.  It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed. This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorio's Band. This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States, but also their sovereignty from one another.  One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians, even though they are all part of the American Indian nation.<ref>\"Montoya v.

Winans'' (1905)===\nIn this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Yakama tribe, reaffirming their prerogative to fish and hunt on off-reservation land. Further, the case established two important principles regarding the interpretation of treaties. First, treaties would be interpreted in the way Indians would have understood them and \"as justice and reason demand\".<ref>''Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association'', 443 U.S. 658, 668</ref> Second, the Reserved Rights Doctrine was established which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians, but rather \"a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them\".<ref>Shultz, Jeffrey D. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics'', p. 710. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-57356-149-5}}</ref> These \"reserved\" rights, meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign, include property rights, which include the rights to fish, hunt and gather, and political rights.

United States'' (1908)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[Winters v. United States]]'' was a case primarily dealing with water rights of [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservations]].  This case clarified what water sources American Indian tribes had \"implied\" rights to put to use.<ref>Duthu, N. (2008). \"American Indians and the Law\", p. 105. Penguin Group Inc., New York. {{ISBN|978-0-670-01857-4}}.</ref>  This case dealt with the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] and their right to utilize the water source of the [[Milk River (Alberta-Montana)|Milk River]] in Montana. The reservation had been created without clearly stating the explicit water rights that the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation had.  This became a problem once non-Indian settlers began moving into the area and using the Milk River as a water source for their settlements.<ref>Shurts, John (2000). \"Indian Reserved Water Rights\", p. 15. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|0806132108}}</ref>  As water sources are extremely sparse and limited in Montana, this argument of who had the legal rights to use the water was presented. After the case was tried, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which had created the American Indian Reservation in the first place. This case was very important in setting a precedent for cases after the assimilation era. It was used as a precedent for the cases ''Arizona v. California'', ''[[Tulee v. Washington]]'', ''Washington v. McCoy'', ''Nevada v. United States'', ''Cappaert v. United States'', ''Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States'', ''United States v. New Mexico'', and ''Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona'' which all focused on the sovereignty of American Indian tribes.\n\n===''Choate v.

However, in the United States Supreme court case ''[[Choate v.

United States'' (1912)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case resulted when a defendant appealed the decision on his case. The defendant filed a writ of error to obtain review of his conviction after being convicted of unlawfully introducing intoxicating liquor into an American Indian reservation. This act was found a violation of the Act of Congress of January 30, 1897, ch. 109, 29 Stat. 506. The defendant's appeal stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the offense for which he was convicted did not occur in American Indian country. The defendant had been arrested while traveling on a train that had just crossed over from American Indian country. The defendant's argument held and the Supreme Court reversed the defendant's conviction remanding the cause to the district court with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.<ref>\"Clairmont v.

Quiver'' (1916)===\nThis case was sent to the United States Supreme Court after first appearing in a district court in South Dakota. The case dealt with adultery committed on a [[Sioux]] Indian reservation. The district court had held that adultery committed by an Indian with another Indian on an Indian reservation was not punishable under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 397, 24 Stat. 635, now \u00a7 316 of the Penal Code. This decision was made because the offense occurred on a Sioux Indian reservation which is not said to be under jurisdiction of the district court. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court saying that the adultery was not punishable as it had occurred between two American Indians on an American Indian reservation.<ref>\"United States v.

From the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for Native American girls, and would later offer classes for female African-American slaves and free women of color.\n\n[[File:Male Carlisle School Students 1879.jpg|295px|thumb|left|Male Carlisle School students (1879)]]\n\nThe [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] founded by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1879 was the first Indian [[boarding school]] established.  Pratt was encouraged by the progress of Native Americans whom he had supervised as prisoners in Florida, where they had received basic education.  When released, several were sponsored by American church groups to attend institutions such as [[Hampton Institute]]. He believed education was the means to bring American Indians into society.\n\nPratt professed \"assimilation through total immersion\". Because he had seen men educated at schools like Hampton Institute become educated and assimilated, he believed the principles could be extended to Indian children. Immersing them in the larger culture would help them adapt. In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, the Carlisle curriculum was modeled on the many industrial schools: it constituted vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls, in expectation of their opportunities on the reservations, including chores around the school and producing goods for market. In the summer, students were assigned to local farms and townspeople for boarding and to continue their immersion. They also provided labor at low cost, at a time when many children earned pay for their families.\n\nCarlisle and its curriculum became the model for schools sponsored by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. By 1902 there were twenty-five federally funded non-reservation schools across fifteen states and territories with a total enrollment of over 6,000. Although federal legislation made education compulsory for Native Americans, removing students from reservations required parental authorization. Officials coerced parents into releasing a quota of students from any given reservation.\n\n[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|325px|thumb|right|Pupils at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania (c. 1900)]]\n\nOnce the new students arrived at the boarding schools, their lives altered drastically. They were usually given new haircuts, uniforms of European-American style clothes, and even new English names, sometimes based on their own, other times assigned at random. They could no longer speak their own languages, even with each other. They were expected to attend Christian churches. Their lives were run by the strict orders of their teachers, and it often included grueling chores and stiff punishments.\n\nAdditionally, infectious disease was widespread in society, and often swept through the schools. This was due to lack of information about causes and prevention, inadequate sanitation, insufficient funding for meals, overcrowded conditions, and students whose resistance was low.\n\n[[File:Group of Male and Female Students; Brick Dormitories And Bandstand in Background 1879.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Native American group of Carlisle Indian Industrial School male and female students; brick dormitories and bandstand in background (1879)]]\n\nAn '''Indian boarding school''' was one of many schools that were established in the United States during the late 19th century to educate [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youths according to American standards. In some areas, these schools were primarily run by missionaries. Especially given the young age of some of the children sent to the schools, they have been documented as traumatic experiences for many of the children who attended them. They were generally forbidden to speak their native languages, taught [[Christianity]] instead of their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Indian identity and adopt American culture. Many cases of mental and sexual abuse have been documented, as in [[North Dakota]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nBy 1923 in the Northwest, most Indian schools had closed and Indian students were attending public schools. States took on increasing responsibility for their education.<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/erdrich/boarding/marr.htm Carolyn Marr, \"Assimilation through Education: Indian Boarding Schools in the Northwest\"], University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</ref>  Other studies suggest attendance in some Indian boarding schools grew in areas of the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century, doubling from 1900 to the 1960s.<ref>Colmant, S.A.

Assessments found the schools to be underfunded and understaffed, too heavily institutionalized, and run too rigidly. What had started as an idealistic program about education had gotten subverted.\n\nIt recommended:\n* abolishing the \"Uniform Course of Study\", which taught only majority American cultural values;\n* having younger children attend community schools near home, though older children should be able to attend non-reservation schools; and\n* ensuring that the Indian Service provided Native Americans with the skills and education to adapt both in their own traditional communities (which tended to be more rural) and the larger American society.\n\n===Indian New Deal===\n[[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1933\u20131945, set the priorities of the [[New Deal]] policies toward Native Americans, with an emphasis on reversing as much of the assimilationist policy as he could. Collier was instrumental in ending the loss of reservations lands held by Indians, and in enabling many tribal nations to re-institute self-government and preserve their traditional culture. Some Indian tribes rejected the unwarranted outside interference with their own political systems the new approach had brought them.\n\nCollier's 1920\u2013 1922 visit to [[Taos Pueblo]] had a lasting impression on Collier. He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be \"physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless\".<ref>John Collier, \"Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?\" ''The American Magazine of Art.

It was one of the most influential and lasting pieces of legislation relating to federal Indian policy. Also known as the Wheeler\u2013Howard Act, this legislation reversed fifty years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian [[self-determination]] and a return of communal Indian land, which was in direct contrast with the objectives of the [[Indian General Allotment Act of 1887]].\n\nCollier was also responsible for getting the [[Johnson\u2013O'Malley Act]] passed in 1934, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to sign contracts with state governments to subsidize public schooling, medical care, and other services for Indians who did not live on reservations. The act was effective only in Minnesota.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson|author2=Raymond Wilson|title=Native Americans in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHj1q_kj1pAC&pg=PA113|year=1986|publisher=University of Illinois Press|pages=113\u201315|isbn=9780252012853}}</ref>\n\nCollier's support of the [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] program resulted in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] opposition to the Indian New Deal.<ref>Peter Iverson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aP4QyAXsnmkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Dine:+A+History+of+the+Navajos%27%27&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ZYVIVemtMYP6aL-sgOAF&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Dine%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Navajos''&f=false Din\u00e9: A History of the Navajos]'' (2002) p 144</ref><ref>Donald A.

Many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2007, 9,500 American Indian children lived in an Indian boarding school dormitory.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} From 1879 when the Carlisle Indian School was founded to the present day, more than 100,000 American Indians are estimated to have attended an Indian boarding school.\n\nA similar system in Canada was known as the [[Canadian residential school system]].<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html Andrea Smith, \"Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208092347/http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html |date=2006-02-08 }}, ''Amnesty Magazine'', Amnesty International website</ref>\n\n==Lasting effects of the Americanization policy==\nWhile the concerted effort to assimilate Native Americans into American culture was abandoned officially, integration of Native American tribes and individuals continues to the present day. Often Native Americans are perceived as having been assimilated. However, some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily \"white\" European majority society, despite efforts to socially integrate them.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn the mid-20th century, as efforts were still under way for assimilation, some studies treated American Indians simply as another ethnic minority, rather than citizens of semi-sovereign entities which they are entitled to by treaty. The following quote from the May 1957 issue of ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', shows this:\n\n{{quote|The place of Indians in American society may be seen as one aspect of the question of the integration of minority groups into the social system.<ref>Dozier, Edward, et al. \"The Integration of Americans of Indian Descent\", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 311, ''American Indians and American Life'' May 1957, pp. 158\u2013165.</ref>}}\n\nSince the 1960s, however, there have been major changes in society. Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups, as well as for the special status of Native American nations. More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices, for instance, points to major changes in government policy.  Similarly the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it.\n\nAs of 2013, \"Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n |title=Native American Center Facts \n |work=The University of Montana \n |accessdate=2013-10-27 \n |url=http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195725/http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |archivedate=2013-10-29 \n}}</ref> The \"Indian Education for All\" curriculum, created by the [[Montana Office of Public Instruction]], is distributed online for primary and secondary schools.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Indian Education for All Lesson Plans\n| accessdate = 2013-10-27\n| url = http://www.opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131028155654/http://opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-date = 2013-10-28\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Modern cultural and linguistic preservation==\n{{further|Language shift|Language revitalization}}\nTo evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction.

Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities.\n\n[[Americanization]] policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States (American) customs and values, they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society.  After the end of the [[Indian Wars]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies.  It established [[Native American boarding schools]] which children were required to attend. In these schools they were forced to speak English, study standard subjects, attend church, and leave tribal traditions behind.\n\nThe [[Dawes Act|Dawes Act of 1887]], which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals, was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans.  Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions.  It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of {{convert|93|e6acre|km2}} from Native American control.  Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals.  The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations.  The leading opponent of forced assimilation was [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies.\n\n==Europeans and Native Americans in North America, 1601\u20131776==\n\n[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern North America; the 1763 \"Proclamation line\" is the border between the red and the pink areas.]]\n[[Epidemiological]] and [[archeological]] work has established the effects of increased immigration of children accompanying families to North America from 1634\u20131640.  They came from areas where [[smallpox]] was endemic in the Netherlands, England and France, and passed on the disease to indigenous people.  Tribes such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]/[[Wyandot people|Wendat]] and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634.<ref name=\"Warrick\">Gary Warrick, \"European Infectious Disease and Depopulation of the Wendat-Tionontate (Huron-Petun)\", ''World Archaeology'' 35 (October 2003), 258\u2013275.</ref>\n\nDuring this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America, just as they were doing in Europe. At the same time, indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas.  The French, English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies, otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles.  In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces, which deepened some of their rivalries.  To secure the help of the tribes, the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties. The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribe's traditional lands and independence.  In addition, the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons, wanting to keep allies in the fur and [[gun]] trades, positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes, etc.  Many Native American tribes took part in [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131697), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702\u20131713) ([[War of the Spanish Succession]]), [[Dummer's War]] (c. 1721\u20131725), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763) ([[Seven Years' War]]).\n\nAs the dominant power after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain instituted the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], to try to protect indigenous peoples' territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community.  In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward.  The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists.  Europeans and European governments continued to use military/diplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans. For further information see [[European colonization of the Americas]].\n\nFrom the Native American perspective, European control of an area generally means a dramatic change in their way of life, with free movement across hunting grounds curtailed or objected to, for instance, by Europeans who had different conceptions of property and the uses of land.\n\n==The United States and Native Americans, 1776\u20131860==\n[[File:Benjamin Hawkins and the Creek Indians.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]] demonstrating European methods of farming to [[Creek (people)|Creek]] (Muscogee) on his Georgia plantation situated along the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]], 1805]]\n\nThe struggle for empire in [[North America]] caused the [[United States]] in its earliest years to adopt an Indian policy similar to the one devised by [[Great Britain]] in colonial times.<ref name=\"fritz\">Fritz, Henry E. (1963).  ''The Movement for Indian in 1860\u20131890''.  University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> They realized that good relations with bordering tribes were important for political and trading reasons, but as had the British, they reserved the right to abandon these good relations to absorb the lands of their enemies and allies alike as the agricultural frontier moved west. The United States continued the use of Native Americans as allies, including during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]]. As relations with England and Spain normalized during the early 19th century, the need for such friendly relations ended. It was no longer necessary to \"woo\" the tribes to prevent the other powers from using them against the United States.  Now, instead of a buffer against other \"civilized\" foes, the tribes often became viewed as an obstacle in the expansion of the United States.\n\nGeorge Washington formulated a policy to encourage the \"civilizing\" process.<ref name=\"remini_reform_begins\" /> He had a six-point plan for civilization which included:\n\n# impartial justice toward Native Americans\n# regulated buying of Native American lands\n# promotion of commerce\n# promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society\n# presidential authority to give presents\n# punishing those who violated Native American rights.<ref name=eric_miller>\n{{cite book\n|chapterurl        = http://www.dreric.org/library/northwest.shtml\n|title      = George Washington And Indians\n |accessdate=2008-05-02\n|last       = Miller\n|first      = Eric\n|year       = 1994\n|chapter    = Washington and the Northwest War, Part One\n|publisher  = Eric Miller\n}}\n</ref>\n\nRobert Remini, a historian, wrote that \"once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans\".<ref name=remini_submit_adoption>\n{{cite book\n|last      = Remini\n|first     = Robert\n|title     = Andrew Jackson\n|origyear  = 1977, 1998\n |publisher=History Book Club\n|chapter   = \"Brothers, Listen ...

But it has been conceived to be impracticable to civilize the Indians of North America \u2013 This opinion is probably more convenient than just.|Henry Knox to George Washington, 1790s.<ref name=eric_miller/>}}\n\n===Indian removal===\nThe [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 characterized the US government policy of [[Indian removal]], which called for relocation of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river. While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes, it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission, though it was often ignored.\n\nOn September 27, 1830, the [[Choctaws]] signed [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed. The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory.\n\nWhile the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary, it was often abused by government officials.  The best-known example is the [[Treaty of New Echota]].  It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of [[Cherokee]] tribal members, not the tribal leadership, on December 29, 1835. While tribal leaders objected to Washington, DC and the treaty was revised in 1836, the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838.<ref>Hoxie, Frederick (1984). ''A Final Promise: The Campaign to Assimilate the Indians, 1880\u20131920''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.</ref> An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died in the march, now known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nIn the decades that followed, white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans. American settlers eventually made homesteads from coast to coast, just as the Native Americans had before them. No tribe was untouched by the influence of white traders, farmers, and soldiers.\n\n===Office of Indian Affairs===\nThe Office of Indian Affairs ([[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as of 1947) was established on March 11, 1824, as an office of the [[United States Department of War]], an indication of the state of relations with the Indians. It became responsible for negotiating treaties and enforcing conditions, at least for Native Americans. In 1849 the bureau was transferred to the [[Department of the Interior]] as so many of its responsibilities were related to the holding and disposition of large land assets.\n\nIn 1854 Commissioner [[George W. Manypenny]] called for a new code of regulations. He noted that there was no place in the West where the Indians could be placed with a reasonable hope that they might escape conflict with white settlers. He also called for the Intercourse Law of 1834 to be revised, as its provisions had been aimed at individual intruders on Indian territory rather than at organized expeditions.\n\nIn 1858 the succeeding Commissioner, [[Charles Mix]], noted that the repeated removal of tribes had prevented them from acquiring a taste for European way of life. In 1862 Secretary of the Interior [[Caleb B. Smith]] questioned the wisdom of treating tribes as quasi-independent nations.<ref name=\"fritz\" /> Given the difficulties of the government in what it considered good efforts to support separate status for Native Americans, appointees and officials began to consider a policy of Americanization instead.\n\n==Americanization and assimilation (1857\u20131920)==\n{{see also|Federal Indian Policy#Allotment and assimilation era (1887\u20131943)}}\n[[File:Portrait of Marsdin, Non-Native Man, and Group of Students SEP 1893.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Portrait of Marsdin, non-native man, and group of students from the Alaska region]]\nThe movement to reform Indian administration and assimilate Indians as citizens originated in the pleas of people who lived in close association with the natives and were shocked by the fraudulent and indifferent management of their affairs. They called themselves \"Friends of the Indian\" and lobbied officials on their behalf.  Gradually the call for change was taken up by Eastern reformers.<ref name=\"fritz\" />  Typically the reformers were Protestants from well organized denominations who considered assimilation necessary to the Christianizing of the Indians; Catholics were also involved.  The 19th century was a time of major efforts in evangelizing missionary expeditions to all non-Christian people.  In 1865 the government began to make contracts with various missionary societies to operate Indian schools for teaching citizenship, English, and agricultural and mechanical arts.<ref>Robert H. Keller, ''American Protestantism and United States Indian Policy, 1869-82'' (1983)</ref>\n\n===Grant's \"Peace Policy\"===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\n{{see|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}\n\nIn his State of the Union Address on December 4, 1871, [[Ulysses Grant]] stated that \"the policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably ... many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination.\"<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/state-of-the-union/83.html</ref> The emphasis became using civilian workers (not soldiers) to deal with reservation life, especially Protestant and Catholic organizations. The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation. Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems, such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted.<ref>Cary C. Collins, \"A Fall From Grace: Sectarianism and the Grant Peace Policy in Western Washington Territory, 1869\u20131882\", ''Pacific Northwest Forum'' (1995) 8#2 pp 55\u201377</ref>\n\nThe Quakers were motivated by high ideals, played down the role of conversion, and worked well with the Indians. They had been highly organized and motivated by the anti-slavery crusade, and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both ex-slaves and the western tribes. They had Grant's ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy. During 1869\u20131885, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.<ref>Joseph E. Illick, \"'Some Of Our Best Friends Are Indians...': Quaker Attitudes and Actions Regarding the Western Indians during the Grant Administration\", ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1971) 2#3 pp. 283\u2013294 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/967835 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nMany other denominations volunteered to help. In 1871, John H. Stout, sponsored by the Dutch Reformed Church, was sent to the [[Gila River Indian Community|Pima reservation]] in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated at every turn.<ref>Robert A. Trennert, \"John H. Stout and the Grant Peace Policy among the Pimas\", ''Arizona & the West'' (1986) 28#1 pp. 45\u201368</ref>\n\nIn Arizona and New Mexico, the Navajo were resettled on reservations and grew rapidly in numbers. The Peace Policy began in 1870 when the Presbyterians took over the reservations. They were frustrated because they did not understand the Navajo.  However, the Navajo not only gave up raiding but soon became successful at sheep ranching.<ref>Norman Bender, ''New Hope for the Indians: The Grant Peace Policy and the Navajos in the 1870s'' (1989)</ref>\n\nThe peace policy did not fully apply to the Indian tribes that had supported the Confederacy. They lost much of their land as the United States began to confiscate the western portions of the Indian Territory and began to resettle the Indians there on smaller reservations.<ref>https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oklahoma/</ref>\n\nReaction to the massacre of Lt. Col. George Custer's unit at the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.<ref>Brian W. Dippie, {{\"'}}What Will Congress Do About It?' The Congressional Reaction to the Little Big Horn Disaster\", ''North Dakota History'' (1970) 37#3 pp. 161\u2013189</ref>\n\n===Code of Indian Offenses===\nIn 1882, Interior Secretary [[Henry M. Teller]] called attention to the \"great hindrance\" of Indian customs to the progress of assimilation.  The resultant \"Code of Indian Offenses\" in 1883 outlined the procedure for suppressing \"evil practice.\"\n\nA Court of Indian Offenses, consisting of three Indians appointed by the Indian Agent, was to be established at each Indian agency.  The Court would serve as judges to punish offenders.  Outlawed behavior included participation in traditional dances and feasts, polygamy, reciprocal gift giving and funeral practices, and intoxication or sale of liquor.  Also prohibited were \"medicine men\" who \"use any of the arts of the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their heathenish rites and customs.\"  The penalties prescribed for violations ranged from 10 to 90 days imprisonment and loss of government-provided rations for up to 30 days.<ref>http://rcliton.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/code-of-indian-offenses.pdf, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Five Civilized Tribes]] were exempt from the Code which remained in effect until 1933.<ref>http://tribal-law.blogspot.com/2008/02/code-of-indian-offenses.html, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nIn implementation on reservations by Indian judges, the Court of Indian Offenses became mostly an institution to punish minor crimes.  The 1890 report of the Secretary of the Interior lists the activities of the Court on several reservations and apparently no Indian was prosecuted for dances or \"heathenish ceremonies.\"<ref>''Report of the Secretary of the Interior'', Volume II. Washington: GPO, 189, pp. lxxxiii-lxxxix.</ref>    Significantly, 1890 was the year of the [[Ghost Dance]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].\n\n=== The role of the Supreme Court in assimilation ===\nIn 1857, Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] expressed that since Native Americans were \"free and independent people\" that they could become U.S. citizens.<ref name=chiefJustic_taney>\n{{cite web\n| url        = http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/82-1/Hoxie.pdf\n| title      = What was Taney thinking?

Taney, 1857, ''What was Taney thinking? American Indian Citizenship in the era of Dred Scott'', Frederick E. Hoxie, April 2007.<ref name=chiefJustic_taney />}}\n\nThe political ideas during the time of assimilation policy are known by many Indians as the [[progressive era]], but more commonly known as the assimilation era.(1890\u20131928<ref>Hoxie, Frederick E. Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. New York: St. Martin's. 2001. (178) Print.</ref>).

The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (191) Print.</ref>  Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts.  The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness.  Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure for every American.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\"/>  These ideas can be seen in the decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era.\n\nCases such as [[Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]], [[Talton v. Mayes]], [[Winters vs. The United States]], [[United States v. Winans]], [[United States v. Nice]], and [[United States v. Sandoval]] provide excellent examples of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as they refer back to the idea of Indians as \"wards of the nation\".<ref>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=187&invol=553</ref> Some other issues that came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives, especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices, whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians, and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws. As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans, the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions.  Native American nations were labeled \"domestic dependent nations\" by Marshall in [[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]], one of the first landmark cases involving Indians.<ref>Duthu, Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Books, 2008. (XXV) Print.</ref> Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes, while others preserved tribal sovereignty, while still others sometimes managed to do both.\n\n== Decisions focusing on dependence ==\n\n===''United States vs. Kagama''===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'' (1886) set the stage for the court to make even more powerful decisions based on plenary power.  To summarize congressional plenary power, the court stated:\n\n{{quote|The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, is necessary to their protection, as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell. It must exist in that government, because it never has existed anywhere else; because the theater of its exercise is within the geographical limits of the United [118 U.S. 375, 385] States; because it has never been denied; and because it alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=118&invol=375 \"United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886)\"]. Findlaw. Retrieved on 2009-10-19.</ref>}}\n\nThe decision in ''United States v. Kagama'' led to the new idea that \"protection\" of Native Americans could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs. The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation of Native Americans into American society.<ref name=\"Mask\"/>\n\n===''United States v. Nice''===\nDuring the years leading up to passage of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]], ''United States v. Nice'' (1916), was a result of the idea of barring American Indians from the sale of [[liquor]]. The United States Supreme Court case overruled a decision made eleven years before, ''Matter of Heff'', {{ussc|197|48|1905}}, which allowed American Indian U.S. citizens to drink liquor.<ref name=\"UG\"/> The quick reversal shows how law concerning American Indians often shifted with the changing governmental and popular views of American Indian tribes.<ref>Canby Jr., William. ''American Indian Law In a Nut Shell,'' 4th edition. West Group, 2004. (1) Print.</ref> The US Congress continued to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. While many tribal governments had long prohibited the sale of alcohol on their reservations, the ruling implied that American Indian nations could not be entirely independent, and needed a guardian for protection.\n\n===''United States v. Sandoval''===\nLike ''United States v. Nice,'' the United States Supreme Court case of ''[[United States v. Sandoval]]'' (1913) rose from efforts to bar American Indians from the sale of liquor.  As American Indians were granted citizenship, there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was distinct from regular citizens.  The Sandoval Act reversed the ''U.S. v. Joseph'' decision of 1876, which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians. The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were \"not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution\".<ref>''Red Man's Land White Man's Land'' 2nd edition, Wilcomb B. Washburn, 1995,\np. 141</ref> This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. The ruling continued to suggest that American Indians needed protection.\n\n== Decisions focusing on sovereignty ==\nThere were several United States Supreme Court cases during the assimilation era that focused on the [[sovereignty]] of American Indian nations.  These cases were extremely important in setting precedents for later cases and for legislation dealing with the sovereignty of American Indian nations.\n\n===''Ex parte Crow Dog'' (1883)===\n''[[Ex parte Crow Dog]]'' was a US Supreme Court appeal by an Indian who had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.  The defendant was an American Indian who had been found guilty of the murder of another American Indian.  [[Crow Dog]] argued that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed between two American Indians that happened on an American Indian reservation.  The court found that although the reservation was located within the territory covered by the district court's jurisdiction, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2146 precluded the inmate's indictment in the district court. Section 2146 stated that Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2145, which made the criminal laws of the United States applicable to Indian country, did not apply to crimes committed by one Indian against another, or to crimes for which an Indian was already punished by the law of his tribe.  The Court issued the writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and ''certiorari'' to the Indian.<ref>''Ex parte Crow Dog'', {{ussc|109|556|1883}}</ref>\n\n===''Talton v. Mayes'' (1896)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Talton v. Mayes]]'' was a decision respecting the authority of tribal governments. This case decided that the individual rights protections, specifically the Fifth Amendment, which limit federal, and later, state governments, do not apply to tribal government. It reaffirmed earlier decisions, such as the 1831 ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' case, that gave Indian tribes the status of \"domestic dependent nations\", the sovereignty of which is independent of the federal government.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/163/376/case.html \"Full text opinion from Justia.com\"]</ref> ''Talton v. Mayes'' is also a case dealing with Native American dependence, as it deliberated over and upheld the concept of congressional plenary authority. This part of the decision led to some important pieces of legislation concerning Native Americans, the most important of which is the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n===''Good Shot v. United States'' (1900)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case occurred when an American Indian shot and killed a non-Indian. The question arose of whether or not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue. In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of [[certiorari]]. This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.<ref>\"Good Shot v. United States''. LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''Montoya v. United States'' (1901)===\nThis United States Supreme court case came about when the surviving partner of the firm of E. Montoya & Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880. It was believed that the livestock was taken by \"Victorio's Band\"  which was a group of these American Indians.  It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed. This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorio's Band. This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States, but also their sovereignty from one another.  One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians, even though they are all part of the American Indian nation.<ref>\"Montoya v. United States\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''US v. Winans'' (1905)===\nIn this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Yakama tribe, reaffirming their prerogative to fish and hunt on off-reservation land. Further, the case established two important principles regarding the interpretation of treaties. First, treaties would be interpreted in the way Indians would have understood them and \"as justice and reason demand\".<ref>''Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association'', 443 U.S. 658, 668</ref> Second, the Reserved Rights Doctrine was established which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians, but rather \"a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them\".<ref>Shultz, Jeffrey D. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics'', p. 710. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-57356-149-5}}</ref> These \"reserved\" rights, meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign, include property rights, which include the rights to fish, hunt and gather, and political rights.

United States'' (1908)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[Winters v. United States]]'' was a case primarily dealing with water rights of [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservations]].  This case clarified what water sources American Indian tribes had \"implied\" rights to put to use.<ref>Duthu, N. (2008). \"American Indians and the Law\", p. 105. Penguin Group Inc., New York. {{ISBN|978-0-670-01857-4}}.</ref>  This case dealt with the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] and their right to utilize the water source of the [[Milk River (Alberta-Montana)|Milk River]] in Montana. The reservation had been created without clearly stating the explicit water rights that the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation had.  This became a problem once non-Indian settlers began moving into the area and using the Milk River as a water source for their settlements.<ref>Shurts, John (2000). \"Indian Reserved Water Rights\", p. 15. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|0806132108}}</ref>  As water sources are extremely sparse and limited in Montana, this argument of who had the legal rights to use the water was presented. After the case was tried, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which had created the American Indian Reservation in the first place. This case was very important in setting a precedent for cases after the assimilation era. It was used as a precedent for the cases ''Arizona v. California'', ''[[Tulee v. Washington]]'', ''Washington v. McCoy'', ''Nevada v. United States'', ''Cappaert v. United States'', ''Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States'', ''United States v. New Mexico'', and ''Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona'' which all focused on the sovereignty of American Indian tribes.\n\n===''Choate v. Trapp'' (1912)===\nAs more Native Americans received allotments through the [[Dawes Act]], there was a great deal of public and state pressure to tax allottees. However, in the United States Supreme court case ''[[Choate v. Trapp]]'', {{ussc|224|665|1912}}, the court ruled for Indian allottees to be exempt from state taxation.<ref name=\"UG\">Wilkins, David, and K. Tsianina Lomawaima.

United States'' (1912)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case resulted when a defendant appealed the decision on his case. The defendant filed a writ of error to obtain review of his conviction after being convicted of unlawfully introducing intoxicating liquor into an American Indian reservation. This act was found a violation of the Act of Congress of January 30, 1897, ch. 109, 29 Stat. 506. The defendant's appeal stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the offense for which he was convicted did not occur in American Indian country. The defendant had been arrested while traveling on a train that had just crossed over from American Indian country. The defendant's argument held and the Supreme Court reversed the defendant's conviction remanding the cause to the district court with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.<ref>\"Clairmont v.

Quiver'' (1916)===\nThis case was sent to the United States Supreme Court after first appearing in a district court in South Dakota. The case dealt with adultery committed on a [[Sioux]] Indian reservation. The district court had held that adultery committed by an Indian with another Indian on an Indian reservation was not punishable under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 397, 24 Stat. 635, now \u00a7 316 of the Penal Code. This decision was made because the offense occurred on a Sioux Indian reservation which is not said to be under jurisdiction of the district court. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court saying that the adultery was not punishable as it had occurred between two American Indians on an American Indian reservation.<ref>\"United States v.

From the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for Native American girls, and would later offer classes for female African-American slaves and free women of color.\n\n[[File:Male Carlisle School Students 1879.jpg|295px|thumb|left|Male Carlisle School students (1879)]]\n\nThe [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] founded by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1879 was the first Indian [[boarding school]] established.  Pratt was encouraged by the progress of Native Americans whom he had supervised as prisoners in Florida, where they had received basic education.  When released, several were sponsored by American church groups to attend institutions such as [[Hampton Institute]]. He believed education was the means to bring American Indians into society.\n\nPratt professed \"assimilation through total immersion\". Because he had seen men educated at schools like Hampton Institute become educated and assimilated, he believed the principles could be extended to Indian children. Immersing them in the larger culture would help them adapt. In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, the Carlisle curriculum was modeled on the many industrial schools: it constituted vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls, in expectation of their opportunities on the reservations, including chores around the school and producing goods for market. In the summer, students were assigned to local farms and townspeople for boarding and to continue their immersion. They also provided labor at low cost, at a time when many children earned pay for their families.\n\nCarlisle and its curriculum became the model for schools sponsored by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. By 1902 there were twenty-five federally funded non-reservation schools across fifteen states and territories with a total enrollment of over 6,000. Although federal legislation made education compulsory for Native Americans, removing students from reservations required parental authorization. Officials coerced parents into releasing a quota of students from any given reservation.\n\n[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|325px|thumb|right|Pupils at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania (c. 1900)]]\n\nOnce the new students arrived at the boarding schools, their lives altered drastically. They were usually given new haircuts, uniforms of European-American style clothes, and even new English names, sometimes based on their own, other times assigned at random. They could no longer speak their own languages, even with each other. They were expected to attend Christian churches. Their lives were run by the strict orders of their teachers, and it often included grueling chores and stiff punishments.\n\nAdditionally, infectious disease was widespread in society, and often swept through the schools. This was due to lack of information about causes and prevention, inadequate sanitation, insufficient funding for meals, overcrowded conditions, and students whose resistance was low.\n\n[[File:Group of Male and Female Students; Brick Dormitories And Bandstand in Background 1879.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Native American group of Carlisle Indian Industrial School male and female students; brick dormitories and bandstand in background (1879)]]\n\nAn '''Indian boarding school''' was one of many schools that were established in the United States during the late 19th century to educate [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youths according to American standards. In some areas, these schools were primarily run by missionaries. Especially given the young age of some of the children sent to the schools, they have been documented as traumatic experiences for many of the children who attended them. They were generally forbidden to speak their native languages, taught [[Christianity]] instead of their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Indian identity and adopt American culture. Many cases of mental and sexual abuse have been documented, as in [[North Dakota]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nBy 1923 in the Northwest, most Indian schools had closed and Indian students were attending public schools. States took on increasing responsibility for their education.<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/erdrich/boarding/marr.htm Carolyn Marr, \"Assimilation through Education: Indian Boarding Schools in the Northwest\"], University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</ref>  Other studies suggest attendance in some Indian boarding schools grew in areas of the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century, doubling from 1900 to the 1960s.<ref>Colmant, S.A.

Assessments found the schools to be underfunded and understaffed, too heavily institutionalized, and run too rigidly. What had started as an idealistic program about education had gotten subverted.\n\nIt recommended:\n* abolishing the \"Uniform Course of Study\", which taught only majority American cultural values;\n* having younger children attend community schools near home, though older children should be able to attend non-reservation schools; and\n* ensuring that the Indian Service provided Native Americans with the skills and education to adapt both in their own traditional communities (which tended to be more rural) and the larger American society.\n\n===Indian New Deal===\n[[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1933\u20131945, set the priorities of the [[New Deal]] policies toward Native Americans, with an emphasis on reversing as much of the assimilationist policy as he could. Collier was instrumental in ending the loss of reservations lands held by Indians, and in enabling many tribal nations to re-institute self-government and preserve their traditional culture. Some Indian tribes rejected the unwarranted outside interference with their own political systems the new approach had brought them.\n\nCollier's 1920\u2013 1922 visit to [[Taos Pueblo]] had a lasting impression on Collier. He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be \"physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless\".<ref>John Collier, \"Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?\" ''The American Magazine of Art.

It was one of the most influential and lasting pieces of legislation relating to federal Indian policy. Also known as the Wheeler\u2013Howard Act, this legislation reversed fifty years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian [[self-determination]] and a return of communal Indian land, which was in direct contrast with the objectives of the [[Indian General Allotment Act of 1887]].\n\nCollier was also responsible for getting the [[Johnson\u2013O'Malley Act]] passed in 1934, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to sign contracts with state governments to subsidize public schooling, medical care, and other services for Indians who did not live on reservations. The act was effective only in Minnesota.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson|author2=Raymond Wilson|title=Native Americans in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHj1q_kj1pAC&pg=PA113|year=1986|publisher=University of Illinois Press|pages=113\u201315|isbn=9780252012853}}</ref>\n\nCollier's support of the [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] program resulted in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] opposition to the Indian New Deal.<ref>Peter Iverson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aP4QyAXsnmkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Dine:+A+History+of+the+Navajos%27%27&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ZYVIVemtMYP6aL-sgOAF&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Dine%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Navajos''&f=false Din\u00e9: A History of the Navajos]'' (2002) p 144</ref><ref>Donald A.

Many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2007, 9,500 American Indian children lived in an Indian boarding school dormitory.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} From 1879 when the Carlisle Indian School was founded to the present day, more than 100,000 American Indians are estimated to have attended an Indian boarding school.\n\nA similar system in Canada was known as the [[Canadian residential school system]].<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html Andrea Smith, \"Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208092347/http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html |date=2006-02-08 }}, ''Amnesty Magazine'', Amnesty International website</ref>\n\n==Lasting effects of the Americanization policy==\nWhile the concerted effort to assimilate Native Americans into American culture was abandoned officially, integration of Native American tribes and individuals continues to the present day. Often Native Americans are perceived as having been assimilated. However, some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily \"white\" European majority society, despite efforts to socially integrate them.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn the mid-20th century, as efforts were still under way for assimilation, some studies treated American Indians simply as another ethnic minority, rather than citizens of semi-sovereign entities which they are entitled to by treaty. The following quote from the May 1957 issue of ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', shows this:\n\n{{quote|The place of Indians in American society may be seen as one aspect of the question of the integration of minority groups into the social system.<ref>Dozier, Edward, et al. \"The Integration of Americans of Indian Descent\", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 311, ''American Indians and American Life'' May 1957, pp. 158\u2013165.</ref>}}\n\nSince the 1960s, however, there have been major changes in society. Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups, as well as for the special status of Native American nations. More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices, for instance, points to major changes in government policy.  Similarly the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it.\n\nAs of 2013, \"Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n |title=Native American Center Facts \n |work=The University of Montana \n |accessdate=2013-10-27 \n |url=http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195725/http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |archivedate=2013-10-29 \n}}</ref> The \"Indian Education for All\" curriculum, created by the [[Montana Office of Public Instruction]], is distributed online for primary and secondary schools.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Indian Education for All Lesson Plans\n| accessdate = 2013-10-27\n| url = http://www.opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131028155654/http://opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-date = 2013-10-28\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Modern cultural and linguistic preservation==\n{{further|Language shift|Language revitalization}}\nTo evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction.

The team was founded in 1919 by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]], and for the next two years played against local teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. In 1921, the Packers joined the ''American Professional Football Association'', the precursor to the (NFL) with Curly Lambeau as their coach. After falling into financial trouble, the Green Bay Football Corporation, now known as [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.]], was formed in 1923. The Packers became a publicly owned football team run by a board of directors elected each year. The team went on to win six NFL championships from 1929 to 1944, including three straight (1929&ndash;1931). Along the way, Curly Lambeau, with the help of receiver [[Don Hutson]], revolutionized football through the development and utilization of the forward pass.\n\nAfter Curly Lambeau resigned from the Packers in 1949, the team fell into a slump. They did not have a winning record for 11 straight seasons until 1959, the year that the Packers hired a new coach, [[Vince Lombardi]]. Lombardi would go on to lead one of the most successful teams in league history. Thirteen [[Pro Football Hall of Famers]] played for Lombardi, including quarterback [[Bart Starr]] and linebacker [[Ray Nitschke]]. The Packers lost the 1960 NFL Championship, however they would go on to win five championships in seven years under Lombardi, including three straight between 1965 and 1967. This included the infamous [[1967 NFL Championship Game|Ice Bowl]] and the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. After the passing of Curly Lambeau in 1965, the Packers new stadium (built in 1957 as ''City Stadium'') was named [[Lambeau Field]] in his honor. Five years later, the Packers second great coach, Vince Lombardi, died, just two years after leaving the team for the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1992 the Packers only made the playoffs twice. Even with former quarterback Bart Starr as head coach, the Packers were unable to regain their former glory. The team continued to falter until [[Ron Wolf]] took over as general manager. Wolf hired [[Mike Holmgren]] as head coach and traded a first-round draft pick to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. Favre would go on to lead the Packers to eleven playoffs appearances, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship in 1996. In 1997, the Packers had their fourth stock sale, expanding the number of shareholders and using the money to fund further expansion of Lambeau Field. In 2005, the Packers drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]]. After Favre left the team in 2007, Rodgers became the starter. {{As of|2017}}, he has led the Packers to eight playoffs appearances and one [[Super Bowl XLV|Super Bowl victory in 2010]]. The Packers had their fifth and most recent stock sale in 2012, again expanding the number of shareholders and using the funding to expand Lambeau Field. With a capacity of 81,441, Lambeau Field is the [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|fifth-largest stadium]] in the NFL. {{As of|2018}}, the Packers hold the record for the most NFL championships (13 total) and the second-most wins in NFL history.\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:Greenbay  packers 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1920 Green Bay Packers.]]\nThe Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919, by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]].<ref>[http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html \"Birth of a Team and a Legend\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218235758/http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html |date=2014-02-18 }} on Packers website</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Names |first1=Larry D |editor1-first=Greg |editor1-last=Scott |title=The History of the Green Bay Packers: The Lambes the oldest team name still in use in the NFL.}} The Green Bay Packers are the oldest NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name and the same location.</ref> Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the [[Indian Packing Company]]. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment.\n\nThe [[1919 Green Bay Packers season]] was their first season of competitive football. The club played against other teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] and ended the season with a 10\u20131 record, losing only to the [[Beloit Fairies]].\n\nThe team became the Acme Packers{{snd}}under the ownership of the Clair brothers{{snd}}and a professional franchise when they joined the newly formed ''American Professional Football Association'' on August 27, 1921. However, the franchise was revoked by the league at the end of the season when the Packers were revealed to have used college players in a game. As it turned out, the man who told the league of this was George Halas of the Chicago Staleys, who changed their name to the Bears the following year. This incident signaled the start of the infamous Packers-Bears rivalry. Lambeau appealed to the league and they allowed the franchise to be reinstated, though Lambeau had to pay the league entry fee of $50 to do so. Further troubles threatened to add more debt to the team, but local businessmen, known as \"[[The Hungry Five]],\" got behind the team and formed the Green Bay Football Corporation in 1923, which continues to run the franchise.\n\n==Public company==\n\nThe Packers are now the only publicly owned company with a [[Green Bay Packers Board of Directors|Board of Directors]] in American professional sports (although other teams, such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] <nowiki>[Liberty Media, previously Time Warner]</nowiki>, [[New York Rangers]] & [[New York Knicks]] <nowiki>[Cablevision]</nowiki>, the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] <nowiki>[Compuware]</nowiki>, and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] <nowiki>[Rogers Communications]</nowiki> are directly owned by publicly traded companies; additionally, three of the nine teams in [[Canada]]'s [[Canadian Football League]] exist with various forms of community ownership [the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] employ a similar ownership structure as the Packers; they have offered shares of the team periodically]). Typically, a team is owned by one person, partnership, or corporate entity; thus, a \"team owner.\" It has been speculated that this is one of the reasons the Green Bay Packers have never been moved from the city of Green Bay, a city of only 104,057 people in the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923205832/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenbay packers 1921.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A formation of the Packers in 1921.]]\nBy comparison, the typical NFL football team city's population is in either the high hundred-thousands or the millions. The Packers, however, have long had a large following throughout [[Wisconsin]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]; in fact, for decades, the Packers played four (one pre-season, three regular-season) home games each year in [[Milwaukee]], first at the [[Wisconsin State Fair Park|State Fair Park]] fairgrounds, then at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The Packers did not move their entire home schedule to Green Bay until 1995.\n\nThe reason for ending the series of Milwaukee games, according to team president Robert Harlan, was the larger capacity of Lambeau Field and the availability of luxury boxes, which were not available at Milwaukee County Stadium.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/sports/pro-football-notebook-can-reich-again-rescue-the-bills.html | work=The New York Times | title=PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK; Can Reich Again Rescue the Bills? | first=Timothy W. | last=Smith | date=December 18, 1994 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> County Stadium's replacement, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], then being planned, was always intended to be a [[baseball park|baseball-only stadium]] instead of a multipurpose stadium; County Stadium was closed and demolished in 2001, with Miller Park opening around the same time.\n\nBased on the original \"Articles of Incorporation for the (then) Green Bay Football Corporation\" put into place in 1923, if the Packers franchise was sold, after the payment of all expenses, any remaining monies would go to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the [[American Legion]] in order to build \"a proper soldier's memorial.\" This stipulation was enacted to ensure the club remained in Green Bay and that there could never be any financial enhancement for the shareholders. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the [[Green Bay Packers Foundation]].\n\nIn 1950, the Packers held a stock sale to again raise money to support the team. In 1956, area voters approved the construction of a new stadium, owned by the city. As with its predecessor, the new field was named City Stadium, but after the death of founder Lambeau in 1965, on September 11, 1965, the stadium was renamed [[Lambeau Field]].\n\nAnother stock sale occurred late in 1997 and early in 1998. It added 105,989 new shareholders and raised over $24 million, money used for the Lambeau Field redevelopment project. Priced at $200 per share, fans bought 120,010 shares during the 17-week sale, which ended March 16, 1998. As of June 8, 2005, 111,921 people (representing 4,749,925 shares) can lay claim to a franchise ownership interest. Shares of stock include voting rights, but the redemption price is minimal, no dividends are ever paid, the stock cannot appreciate in value, and stock ownership brings no season ticket privileges.\n\nNo shareholder may own over 200,000 shares, a safeguard to ensure that no individual can assume control of the club. To run the corporation, a board of directors is elected by the stockholders. The board of directors in turn elect a seven-member Executive Committee (officers) of the corporation, consisting of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and three members-at-large. The president is the only officer to draw compensation; The balance of the committee is sitting \"gratis.\"\n\nThe team's elected president represents the Packers in NFL owners meetings unless someone else is designated. During his time as coach, [[Vince Lombardi]] generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings.\n\n==Championships==\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, more than any other American professional football team (including 4 [[Super Bowl]]s).\nTheir arch-rivals the [[Chicago Bears]] are second, with nine NFL championships (including one Super Bowl). The [[Bears-Packers rivalry|historical rivalry]] with Chicago extends to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] - the Packers have the second most Hall of Famers (21, behind the Bears' 26). The Packers are also the only team to win three straight NFL titles, which they did twice (1929&ndash;1931 and 1965&ndash;67).\n\n==The first Championships (1929-1944)==\nAfter going through modest winning seasons during most of the 1920s, the Packers began to build a championship-caliber team, as they signed three future Hall of Famers in [[John McNally (American football)|\"Johnny Blood\" McNally]], [[Cal Hubbard]], and [[Mike Michalske]]. The Packers won their first NFL Championship in 1929 with a 12-0-1 record, the only undefeated season in Packers history. Their only blemish was a tie with the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]]. The Packers were able to successfully defend their title in 1930, going 10-3-1, and won their third straight league championship in 1931 with a 12\u20132 record.  The Packers nearly won a record fourth straight championship in 1932, going 10-3-1, but finished second behind the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, who shared the best record in the league.  \n\nAs a side note, in 1928 the Packers also signed (for the third time) [[Frances Louis \u201cJug\u201d Earp]].  Jug played for Green Bay: 1922\u20131924, 1925\u20131927, & 1928\u20131932.)  He also was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1970.  Jug and [[Wyatt Earp]] were first cousins.\n\nThe Packers scuffled in 1933 and 1934, having their first ever losing season in 1933 with a 5\u20137 record, followed by a mediocre 7-6 the following year. However, Curly Lambeau was able to build another elite team during these seasons, signing more future Hall of Famers like [[Clarke Hinkle]], [[Arnie Herber]], and most notably, receiver [[Don Hutson]] in 1935.\n\nThe Packers became a perennial championship team in the NFL for the next decade, playing in the NFL championship game four times. The Packers went a dominating 10-1-1 in 1936, defeating the [[Boston Redskins]] for the championship 21\u20136, then lost the title game to the New York Giants in 1938, then won the title back over the Giants in 1939, 27\u20130, and one more title, again over the Giants, in 1944, winning 14\u20137. The Packers stayed at the top of the standings thanks to the play of Hutson, Hinkle, Herber, another future Hall of Famer in [[Tony Canadeo]], and other standouts like [[Cecil Isbell]], [[Ted Fritsch]], [[Buckets Goldenberg]], and [[Russ Letlow]].\n\n==1945\u20131958==\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, the 1944 title season was the start of a long decline for the Packers. Following their 1944 championship, the Packers finished 6\u20134 in 1945 and 6\u20135 in 1946. After the NFL established a uniform 12-game season in 1947, Green Bay won six games, lost five, and had one tie. In 1948, the Packers fell to 3\u20139, only the second losing season in franchise history and their first since 1933. The team bottomed out in 1949 with a record of 2-10, at the time the worst season in franchise history.\n\nIn 1946, Lambeau purchased [[Rockwood Lodge]], a former [[Norbertine]] retreat 17 miles north of Green Bay, and converted it into the first self-contained training facility in pro football history, complete with living and dining facilities for the players and their families. However, the players soon grew to detest the Lodge, primarily because the practice fields sat on top of brick-hard limestone. The players took such a severe beating during practice that Lambeau sometimes had to move practices back to fields near City Stadium. According to a 2013 article in ''[[ESPN The Magazine]],'' the team's rapid on-field decline was tied in part to the unforgiving fields at the Lodge, or \"the Rock\" as the players derisively called it. Additionally, Lambeau refused to abandon the [[Notre Dame Box]], a variation of the [[single-wing formation|single wing]], long after most teams switched to running the [[T formation]].<ref name=BlazeofGlory>{{cite journal |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |title=Blaze of Glory |last=Fleming |first=David |magazine=[[ESPN The Magazine]] |date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207175756/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |archive-date=February 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe team's problems were not limited to the on-field product. The Lodge's upkeep, combined with declining revenues from City Stadium, caused severe financial problems. By 1949, they had gotten so severe that Lambeau largely handed the team to his assistants in order to devote his full attention to the team's balance sheet. Even slashing the payroll and his own salary were not enough to staunch the bleeding. The Packers only survived the season by staging an intrasquad scrimmage with retired players on Thanksgiving Day.<ref name=\"TURB\">{{Cite news | title = Rockwood Lodge had turbulent history | last = Hendricks | first = Martin | url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/ | date = August 18, 2016 | access-date = March 8, 2019 | df = mdy | url-status = live | newspaper = [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] | archive-date = August 24, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160824012535/https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/}}</ref>\n\nAll of this chilled Lambeau's already deteriorating relationship with the Packers management. After giving him a free hand for most of the last three decades, several team executives revolted at the exorbitant costs of buying and renovating Rockwood Lodge; some members of the financial committee almost resigned. Lambeau also rankled fans by spending most of his offseasons on \"recruiting trips\" far from Wisconsin. He arrived in Green Bay for the 1946 season sporting tailored suits, saddle shoes and a cigarette holder, leading fans to call him \"the Earl of Hollywood.\"<ref name=BlazeofGlory/>\n\nBy the end of the 1949 season, the Packers were on a seemingly irreversible slide toward bankruptcy. Rumors abounded that the league would use the impending merger with the [[All-America Football Conference]] as an excuse to force the Packers to either move or fold. Amid this, Lambeau tracked down four investors who were willing to pump $200,000 into the team\u2013provided that the franchise become privately held once again. This proposal was considered rank heresy in Green Bay. Many fans and executives believed NFL officials were pressuring Lambeau to move the team to the West Coast. In response, team president [[Emil R. Fischer]] tendered Lambeau a two-year contract extension that would have stripped Lambeau of all authority over non-football matters. Lambeau rejected the offer out of hand, effectively ending his tenure at the helm of the franchise that he founded.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/>\n\nLambeau formally resigned on February 1, 1950,<ref name=clqtctc>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Curly Lambeau quits to coach the Cardinals |date=February 1, 1950 |page=1, part 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120134159/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Lambeau quits for Card job; Isbell seeks Packer post |date=February 2, 1950 |page=5, part 2 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120133319/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> a little over a week after Rockwood Lodge burned to the ground. Rumors have long abounded that a Packers employee set the fire, though interviews with the family of caretaker Melvin Flagstad and other team officials of the time suggested it was caused by electrical problems. What is beyond dispute is that the $75,000 insurance payout helped pull the team from the financial brink.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/> \n\nEven with the insurance money, the Packers were still struggling both on and off the field. A bond drive was issued in 1950, which raised $118,000 for the struggling team. [[Gene Ronzani]] replaced Lambeau as coach, and the team began using the green and gold colored uniforms that have been worn ever since. Green Bay won three games that season and in 1951. Ronzani's efforts to rebuild the team were severely hampered by the onset of the [[Korean War]]. However, led by a talented crop of rookies, the Packers got out to a 6\u20133 start in 1952 and were in playoff contention for most of the season. However, they closed they year with a three-game losing streak to end the season. A loss to Detroit in the final game left them in fourth place.<ref name=Guilbrandsen>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpXQ19EQMzcC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=I+want+it+understood+that+I+am+in+complete+command+Lombardi&source=bl&ots=qUFl8BNpL4&sig=ACfU3U2VebI4nWJHITgeuXjDCk6GEaTXTw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHz8Tm6-_mAhUEheAKHfs3AAgQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=I%20want%20it%20understood%20that%20I%20am%20in%20complete%20command%20Lombardi&f=false|title=Green Bay Packers: The Complete Illustrated History - Third Edition|author1=Don Guilbrandsen|publisher=[[Voyageur Press]]|date=2011|isbn=1616731486}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the issue of a new stadium began to crop up. City Stadium had long been known to be an extremely inadequate facility. The wooden stadium, adjacent to [[Green Bay East High School|East High School]], seated only 25,000 people and could not be expanded. The Packers had to use East High's locker room facilities, while the visiting team usually dressed at their hotel. Since the 1930s, the Packers had begun playing some home games in [[Milwaukee]]. By the time [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] opened in 1953, the Packers played two or three home games a year in Milwaukee.\n\nThe first game played at MCS was a 27\u20130 shutout at the hands of Cleveland, after which the Packers finished 1953 2-7-1. Ronzani was forced to resign with two games left in the season. [[Verne Llewellyn]] took over as GM in 1954 and [[Lisle Blackbourn]] of [[Marquette University]] was hired as head coach, but the Packers won four games that season. A 6\u20136 record in 1955 again put the team in postseason contention, but a loss to the Bears sent them home. The Packers fell back to 4\u20138 in 1956, a season most noteworthy for the drafting of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] QB [[Bart Starr]].\n\nBy then, the question of the Packers' staying in Green Bay was becoming acute. More and more opponents began asking for their games against the Packers to be played at County Stadium, which was almost double the size of City Stadium. League officials gave the Packers an ultimatum\u2013get a new stadium or move to Milwaukee full-time. Buoyed in part by a strong finish to the 1955 season, the people of Green Bay overwhelmingly passed a bond issue for a brand-new 32,000-seat stadium, naming it [[Lambeau Field|New City Stadium]]. The new stadium was dedicated in a game against the Chicago Bears. The Packers won the game, 21\u201317, but finished the season 3\u20139.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>  \n\nBlackbourn was fired after the season and the coaching job was given to longtime assistant [[Ray McLean|Ray \"Scooter\" McLean]]. By this time, however, the once-proud franchise had become notorious as a dumping ground for players who either underperformed on the field or flouted team rules. Under the circumstances, the 1957 season was an unmitigated disaster. The Packers finished 1\u201310\u20131, the worst record in franchise history. McLean promptly resigned.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\nAmid growing concern inside and outside of Green Bay about the state of the team, the Packers then made what proved to be the most important hire in the history of the franchise, hiring [[Vince Lombardi]], the offensive coordinator of the dominating [[New York Giants]], as head coach and general manager. Lombardi demanded and got complete authority over football operations. Reinforcing the message, when he arrived in Green Bay, he told the executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command around here.\" The message applied to the players as well. Lombardi ran his first training camp as a harsh taskmaster, but the players quickly bought in, setting the stage for the decade to come.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\n==Lombardi era (1959-1967)==\n\nThe Packers of the 1960s were one of the most dominant NFL teams of all time. Coach [[Vince Lombardi]] took over a last-place team in 1959 and built it into a juggernaut, winning five league championships over a seven-year span culminating with victories in the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. During the Lombardi era, the Packers had a group of legendary stars: the offense was led by quarterback [[Bart Starr]], [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]], [[Carroll Dale]], [[Paul Hornung]], [[Forrest Gregg]], [[Fuzzy Thurston]] and [[Jerry Kramer]]; the defense was led by the likes of [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]], [[Henry Jordan]], [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]], [[Ray Nitschke]], [[Dave Robinson (American football)|Dave Robinson]], and [[Herb Adderley]].\n\nSeveral other factors helped the Packers return to success. After Pete Rozelle became NFL Commissioner in 1960, he made sure that every franchise got all its games broadcast on television, as up to that point only big-market teams like the Bears and Giants enjoyed this privilege. TV helped raise revenue for small-market teams like Green Bay, and also there was the introduction of [[revenue sharing]], which ensured that no NFL franchise would have to worry about bankruptcy.\n\nThe greatness of the Packers of the '60s really began [[1959 Green Bay Packers season|one year earlier]] with the hiring of Lombardi. In their first game under Lombardi on September 27, 1959, the Packers beat the heavily favored [[1959 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 9\u20136 at Lambeau Field. The Packers got off to a 3&ndash;0 start before losing the next five, but then won their last four games to achieve their first winning season in 12 years since [[1947 Green Bay Packers season|1947]], ultimately finishing 7\u20135. A 21\u20130 shutout of Washington on November 22 was the last Packers game to date that did not sell out.\n\n[[1960 Green Bay Packers season|The next year in 1960]], the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, finished 8-4 and won their first division title since 1944 during the height of World War II.  They also contested the NFL championship game for the first time since that year.  They won the NFL West Title and played in the [[1960 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] at [[Franklin Field|Philadelphia]]. In a see-saw game the Packers trailed the Eagles by four points late in the game. The Packers began their final drive, aiming for glory, but it was not to be as [[Chuck Bednarik]] tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time ran out. Philadelphia won the championship, 17\u201313. In the locker room after the game, Lombardi told his men that this would be the last time the Packers would lose the championship game with him at the helm. That prediction became fact, as the Packers would never again lose the [[List of NFL champions (1920\u20131969)|NFL Championship Game]] under Lombardi.  This, in fact, would be Vince Lombardi's only postseason loss.\n\nAfter going 11-3 the [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|following season]] in the [[1961 NFL season|NFL's]] newly expanded 14-game schedule, the Packers again won their division and returned to the [[1961 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], as they faced the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], this time at New City Stadium. This time the game was no contest; the Packers exploded for 24 2nd quarter points as Paul Hornung, having recently returned from the [[United States Army|Army]], scored an NFL Championship record 19 points. The Packers shut out the Giants 37\u20130 to win their first championship since [[1944 NFL Championship Game|1944]] and their 7th total.\n\nNot resting on their 1961 Championship, the Packers stormed back in [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|1962]], jumping out to a 10&ndash;0 start en route to an amazing 13&ndash;1 season. This included a rematch with the Eagles in Franklin Field. Green Bay avenged the 1960 championship game by snuffing their opponent 49\u20130 in a game widely referred to as \"Lombardi's Revenge\". It would be the last Packers victory in Philadelphia until 2010. They reached the championship game again, this time in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The Packers faced the [[1962 New York Giants season|Giants]] in a much more brutal [[1962 NFL Championship Game|championship game]] than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the surprising foot of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. They ground down the Giants 16&ndash;7 and Titletown U.S.A. reigned supreme.\n\nA three-peat eluded Green Bay in [[1963 Green Bay Packers season|1963]] as RB Paul Hornung was suspended by the league for betting on games. Without him, the team still finished 11-2-1, but was swept by the Bears, who won the division and ultimately the championship. The Packers were then forced into the embarrassing situation of having to go to Miami for the so-called \"Playoff Bowl\", an exhibition game the NFL held every January during 1960-69 between the second-place finishers of each conference. They beat Cleveland 40\u201323, but Vince Lombardi was not happy about it, calling the Playoff Bowl \"The Shit Bowl. A loser's game for losers. Because that's all second place is.\"\n\nThe Packers appeared to have run out of gas in [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|1964]], winning only eight games, losing five, and having one tie. Again they had to contest the meaningless Playoff Bowl in Miami, this time with the Cardinals, who won 24\u201317. Lombardi was again infuriated, calling it \"a rinky-dink game in a rinky-dink town between two rinky-dink teams.\"\n\n===1965 season===\nDuring the 1965 off-season, Curly Lambeau died and the Packers renamed New City Stadium Lambeau Field in his honor.  After a two-year absence from championship football, the [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|Pack]] was back in [[1965 NFL season|1965]]. The Packers rebounded by winning ten games and losing three.  They won some crucial games, including a 42&ndash;27 win over the [[1965 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], a contest in which Paul Hornung (coming back from a betting scandal and injuries) scored five touchdowns. But, the season ender with San Francisco was a tie, forcing them to play the Colts at home in a playoff for the Western Conference title. A close defensive struggle, the game would be remembered for [[Don Chandler]]'s controversial field goal in which the ball possibly went wide right, but the official raised his arms to grant the three points. The two teams tied at 10-10 and went into overtime, where Green Bay won it on a 25-yard Chandler FG. The disputed win sent the Packers to the NFL Championship Game at home, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the [[1965 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], helping the Packers defeat the Browns 23\u201312 to earn their 3rd NFL Championship under Lombardi.\n\n===1966 and 1967 seasons and first two Super Bowls===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis.jpg|right|thumb|The Packers and the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship game. (Super Bowl I)]]\n[[1966 NFL season|1966]] would prove one of the most important years ever for both the Packers and the NFL as a whole. In 1959, Lamar Hunt and several others, frustrated at the league's lack of interest in expansion, began a rival organization, the American Football League. The AFL was initially laughed at by the NFL, but by 1965 were a serious competitor and began engaging in bidding wars for top college players. This culminated in the New York Jets offering Alabama QB Joe Namath a then unheard of $400,000 contract. During the spring of 1966, NFL and AFL heads met and agreed to an eventual merger into one big league, but only when the latter was deemed up to parity. Until then, the champions of both leagues would meet on a neutral site in January to determine the ultimate champion.\n\nThe Packers meanwhile had one of the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|finest seasons in franchise history]], finishing 12-2 and with Bart Starr being named league MVP. They met the Eastern Conference winner [[1966 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the Cotton Bowl for the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship]]. This celebrated game saw the Packers win 34\u201327. The Packers went on to defeat the AFL's [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 35\u201310 in [[Super Bowl I|the first ever Super Bowl]] (then called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game) at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum|L.A. Coliseum]]. Bart Starr was named the game's MVP.\n\n[[1967 Green Bay Packers season|1967]] marked Vince Lombardi's final triumph. The Packers team was visibly aging, and they finished 9-4-1. However, they still proved all-but-invincible at home as they beat the 11-1-2 [[1967 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 28\u20137 in Milwaukee to again contest the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|league championship]] with [[1967 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]]. This game at Lambeau Field became known as the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]] due to the frigid weather conditions. But again, Green Bay prevailed with a score of 21\u201317.  The Packers now had to [[Super Bowl II|face the AFL champions]] (this time the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]) in Miami's [[Orange Bowl]]. By this point, Lombardi and the team were much more confident of victory as they easily beat Oakland 33\u201314. Again, Starr was named the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nBy winning the 1967 NFL Championship Game, the Packers achieved a \"three-peat\" (three consecutive league championships) for only the second time in franchise history and the first time since they were named league champions following the 1929\u201331 seasons.  To this day, no other NFL team has matched or surpassed this record.  The Packers' back-to-back wins in the first two Super Bowls remains a Super Bowl record, and has since been tied seven times by six other franchises: the Miami Dolphins won Super Bowls VII and VIII following the 1972 and 1973 seasons, the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowls IX and X following the 1974 and 1975 seasons as well as Super Bowls XIII and XIV following the 1978 and 1979 seasons and remain, to date, the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowl titles more than once, the San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV following the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII following the 1992 and 1993 seasons, the Denver Broncos won Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII following the 1997 and 1998 seasons, and most recently, the New England Patriots won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX following the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\nAfter the franchise's victory in [[Super Bowl II]], Vince Lombardi announced that he was stepping down as head coach, although he would retain the title of general manager. [[Phil Bengtson]] took his place.\n\n==The second \"Dark Ages\" (1968-1991)==\nPredictably, the [[1968 Green Bay Packers season|1968 season]] did not see an impressive performance from the Packers (6-7-1) as Bengtson proved unable to fill Lombardi's shoes and key players retired. Meanwhile, an exhausted Vince Lombardi announced his retirement from football altogether, and Phil Bengtson assumed the GM position. The Packers improved to 8\u20136 in [[1969 Green Bay Packers season|1969]], but players continued to retire.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince Lombardi had been seduced out of retirement by the Redskins, who made him HC and 50% owner of that team. He led them to a [[1969 Washington Redskins season|7-5-2 record in 1969]], thus preserving his streak of having never coached a team to a losing season. However, Lombardi fell ill with cancer during the 1970 off-season and died at the age of 57.\n\nThe newly merged NFL named the Super Bowl trophy in his honor, and the street in front of Lambeau Field was named Lombardi Avenue. Meanwhile, the Packers finished [[1970 Green Bay Packers season|1970]] 6\u20138, which included being shut out by Detroit twice. Dejected at his inability to match the standards of his illustrious predecessor, Phil Bengtson resigned as head coach. [[Dan Devine]] assumed the job and began the task of replacing the '60s players with fresh, young talent. Bart Starr himself was the last to go after starting in only four games during [[1971 Green Bay Packers season|1971]] in which he threw three interceptions, scored one rushing touchdown, and had 24 completions in 45 attempts. Most of the work in 1971 was done by newly drafted QB Scott Hunter, and at the close of the season, Starr retired at the age of 36.\n\nPoor drafting of players was a key reason for why the Packers had little success for almost a quarter of a century after Lombardi's departure.  To cite a few examples, in the first round of the [[1972 NFL Draft|1972 draft]], when future Hall of Fame running back [[Franco Harris]] was still available, the Packers instead chose mediocre quarterback [[Jerry Tagge]]. In [[1981 NFL Draft|1981]], when no fewer than three future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] defenders were still available -- [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Mike Singletary]], and [[Howie Long]], the Packers chose another mediocre quarterback, [[Rich Campbell (American football)|Rich Campbell]]. Finally, in [[1989 NFL Draft|1989]], when such future legends as [[Barry Sanders]], [[Deion Sanders]], and [[Derrick Thomas]] were available, the Packers chose offensive lineman [[Tony Mandarich]]. Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations.\n\nAlthough the Packers would not have winning success until [[1992 NFL season|1992]], there were moments when the Packers at times resembled the old Packer days of the 1960s. In [[1972 Green Bay Packers season|1972]], led by workhorse running backs [[John Brockington]] and new Packer [[MacArthur Lane]], and a sturdy defense that featured rookie [[Willie Buchanon]], the Packers captured the NFC Central Division Title with a 10&ndash;4 record. That team would lose in the playoffs to the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 16\u20133. In [[1975 Green Bay Packers season|1975]] under new head coach Bart Starr the Packers won only 4 games, but in one of those wins, the Packers beat the eventual 1975 NFC Champion [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 19&ndash;17 on October 19 in Dallas.\n\n[[1976 Green Bay Packers season|1976]] was another losing campaign, with the Packers only achieving a 5\u20139 record, the lowest in their division. The team dropped back to a 4\u201310 season in [[1977 Green Bay Packers season|1977]]. The frequent changes of quarterbacks during this period was indicative of Green Bay's troubles. When the NFL expanded the regular season to 16 games the following year, the team won six of its first seven matches, but largely due to an easy schedule. After the Packers began facing tougher opponents, the wins dried up and the final record for [[1978 Green Bay Packers season|1978]] was 8-7-1.\n\nThe Packers had another 1,000 yard rusher in [[Terdell Middleton]]: he rushed for 1,116 yards. In the early 1980s, the Packers had a star-studded aerial attack led by quarterback [[Lynn Dickey]] and wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[John Jefferson]].\n\nWhile the 1978 season had raised the morale of Packers fans, it did not last, for the team finished with a 5\u201311 record in [[1979 Green Bay Packers season|1979]], and a 5-10-1 showing during an injury-plagued [[1980 Green Bay Packers season|1980]] season. In [[1981 Green Bay Packers season|1981]], the Packers came close to the playoffs, but lost the final game of the season, a road match against the [[1980 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], and ended up with an 8\u20138 record.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers only qualified for the playoffs twice ([[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1972]] and [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982]] [''pictured'']) during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969-1991).]]\nAfter the [[1982 Green Bay Packers season|1982]] season was reduced to nine games by a players' strike, the NFL held a special playoff tournament with the eight best teams in each conference. The 5-3-1 Packers qualified for this, routing the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season |Cardinals]] 41\u201316, but in the next round lost to the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] 37\u201326. It would be their only playoff win during this rough stretch in the team's history. Another [[1983 Green Bay Packers season|8-8 season]] the following year led to the dismissal of Bart Starr as head coach. [[Forrest Gregg]] succeeded him, but after two more 8\u20138 seasons, he decided to cut several aging players and start over with fresh rookies. The rejuvenated Packers produced a 4\u201312 record in [[1986 Green Bay Packers season|1986]], as was typical of a rebuilding period.\n\nAnother strike affected the NFL in [[1987 Green Bay Packers season|1987]], resulting in a 15-game season. During the strike, the league used substitute players. The Packers fill-ins won one game and lost two before the regulars returned, but in the end the struggling team managed only a 5-9-1 record. Afterwards, Forrest Gregg resigned and was replaced by [[Lindy Infante]]. Still, the team continued to struggle, going 4\u201312 in [[1988 Green Bay Packers season|1988]].\n\nWith such a weak record, the Packers gained the privilege of first-round draft picks during the 1989 off-season. They selected Michigan State offensive tackle [[Tony Mandarich]], who was getting considerable publicity due to his huge 325-pound frame. Mandarich (who later admitted to using steroids in college) proved a poor choice in the end, and after three seasons of mediocre performance was cut. The [[1989 Green Bay Packers season|1989 campaign]] was the best in 17 years, with the Packers compiling a 10\u20136 record (including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXIV]] Champion [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]), but still missing the playoffs. There followed another two losing seasons, with 6-10 and 4-12 records. A general overhaul took place during the 1992 off-season, with [[Mike Holmgren]] replacing Lindy Infante. Most importantly however, the Packers acquired second-year quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]].\n\n==1992-1997: A new golden era==\n\nFavre would get off to a slow start, losing five of his first seven games, but afterwards won six in a row. The Packers finished [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|1992]] with a 9\u20137 record. In the [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|1993]] off-season, the team signed free-agent defensive end [[Reggie White]]. After another slow start, the Packers swept ahead for a 9\u20137 record, reaching the playoffs for the first time in eleven years. In the NFC wild card round, they faced the [[1993 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]], who had beaten them the previous week. In a close game, Favre led the team to a 28\u201324 victory, but in the divisional playoff round Green Bay was overwhelmed 27-17 by the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], the eventual Super Bowl winner. Brett Favre would also make the Pro Bowl following that season.\n\nThe [[1994 Green Bay Packers season|1994 season]] was a near-rerun of the previous year. Again the Packers went 9\u20137, beat the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 16\u201312 in the NFC wild card round, and lost the divisional game 35\u20139 to the [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. In [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|1995]], Favre continued to cement his reputation as one of the NFL's finest quarterbacks, passing for 4,413 yards and scoring 38 touchdown passes during the team's 11-5 regular season. The Packers reached the top of the NFC Central division for the first time since 1971. However, they still had to go through the wildcard round, overpowering [[1995 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] 37\u201320. The divisional round saw them knock out the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 27\u201317, but they were again frustrated by the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]], who triumphed 38\u201327 in the NFC Championship game and went on to win another Super Bowl title.\n\nAs the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|1996 season]] began, the Packers were more determined than ever to reach the Super Bowl. Beginning with an eight-game winning streak, they faced the hated [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] during Week 11 on a Monday Night game. The Packers suffered a smarting loss, the score being 21\u20136. After this, they won the last five regular season games, finishing with a record of 13\u20133. Reaching the top of the NFC Central division, they were able to skip the wild card round this time. In the divisional playoff, they easily defeated [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] at Lambeau, with a score of 35\u201314. Meanwhile, the Cowboys had lost to the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], and so the Packers would have to face this two-year-old expansion team in the NFC Championship match. The Packers beat them 30\u201313 to advance to Super Bowl XXXI.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXI===\n\nFacing Green Bay in the New Orleans Superdome in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] were the AFC champion [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In a see-saw game, the Packers gained a 27\u201314 lead at halftime, which they never lost despite a valiant effort by their opponent. The final score was 35\u201321, and Green Bay had won its first championship since 1967.  Kick returner [[Desmond Howard]], who returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown late in the 3rd quarter, was named the game's MVP, becoming the first (and to date, only) Super Bowl MVP on the merits of special teams play.\n\nThe defending champions would have an easy go of the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|1997 season]], which saw a record of 13\u20133. Brett Favre passed for 3,867 yards and was named the league's MVP third year in a row. In their fifth consecutive playoff appearance, the Packers rolled over the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20137 in the divisional round, then beat the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 23\u201310 in the NFC Championship to make the Super Bowl for the second year in a row.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXII===\n\nPlaying in San Diego's [[Qualcomm Stadium]] for [[Super Bowl XXXII]], the Packers would this time engage the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], who had lost in all their previous Super Bowl appearances. In a game that was even more see-saw than Super Bowl XXXI, Denver had taken the lead in the 4th quarter, with a score of 24\u201317.  Denver took its final lead with under 2 minutes in the game when head coach Mike Holmgren intentionally allowed [[Terrell Davis]] to score the go-ahead touchdown.  In the final minute of the game, Brett Favre threw a desperate pass at tight end [[Mark Chmura]], but it failed and the Broncos walked home with the Lombardi Trophy, ending a 13-year losing streak for the AFC in the Super Bowl.\n\n==1998-2005: Near Successes ==\n[[Image:Bubba Franks88-Edit.jpg|thumb|Former Packers' tight end [[Bubba Franks]], 2007]]\nStill playing strong football, the Packers compiled an 11\u20135 record in [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|1998]], but suffered several key injuries. They made the playoffs for the sixth year in a row, but this time as a wild card. Again, Green Bay faced its perennial foe the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], but luck would not be on their side this time, as they lost a close game, 30\u201327, on a [[Terrell Owens]] touchdown catch with 3 seconds remaining.  Afterwards, Mike Holmgren stepped down as head coach and was succeeded by [[Ray Rhodes]]. The Packers only managed an 8-8 showing in [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|1999]] and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1992, despite a high-scoring season-ending performance against Arizona in an attempt to win a potential points-scored tiebreaker. Rhodes was quickly dumped and replaced by Mike Sherman.  In [[2000 Green Bay Packers season|2000]], the Packers finished 9\u20137, but again did not make the playoffs.\n\nGreen Bay rebounded nicely in [[2001 Green Bay Packers season|2001]], going 12-4 and returning to the playoffs as a wild card. Per established practice, they challenged the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] and beat them 25\u201315, avenging their playoff loss three years earlier. There would be no Super Bowl appearance though, as Green Bay was crushed by the [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in the divisional round 45\u201317. Favre threw a record six interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|following year]] began strongly, with the Packers starting 8\u20131. Divisional realignment had placed them along with Minnesota, Chicago, and Detroit in the new NFC North. Being the only team in their division to achieve a record above .500 in 2002, the Packers seemed a virtual shoo-in for the first-round bye. However, they lost the final game of the season at the [[2002 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], which gave Green Bay the #3 NFC seed and forced them to go through the wild card round.  The playoffs would have a humiliating end as the Packers were routed 27-7 by the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] on a snow-covered Lambeau Field for the franchise's first-ever home playoff loss.\n\n[[2003 Green Bay Packers season|2003]] began rather badly.  Lambeau Field had been renovated that year, but in the season opener, the Packers lost to the [[2003 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 30\u201325.  Brett Favre suffered several injuries during the season, and also had to deal with the death of his father on the eve of a Monday Night trip to Oakland.  However, Favre started, and put up an impressive performance as the Packers trounced the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 41\u20137. The Packers went into the final week needing to win and the Vikings to lose to win the NFC North in order to get the last playoff spot.  The Packers beat the [[2003 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] while the [[2003 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] rallied in the final seconds to beat the Vikings, giving the Packers the NFC North championship with an 11\u20135 record. The wild card round saw a fierce struggle with the [[2003 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], which tied 27-27 and went into overtime.  Defensive back Al Harris intercepted a pass from former Packer quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] and returned it 52 yards for a touchdown, giving the Packers the win. In the divisional round, the Packers lost to [[2003 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]]. That game also went into overtime, tied 17-17, but Favre threw a pass up into the air that was intercepted by Eagles safety [[Brian Dawkins]]. Several plays later, the Eagles kicked a field goal and won 20\u201317.\n\nIn [[2004 Green Bay Packers season|2004]], Green Bay compiled a 10\u20136 season and reached the playoffs as a wildcard, but lost to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 31\u201317 in the first-ever playoff meeting between the two rivals.\n\nDuring the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|2005]] off-season, the team drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] from California. Rodgers was intended to be the eventual successor to Favre, now 36 years old and showing his age by turning in a poor performance that year. Despite a devastating 52\u20133 win over New Orleans in Week 5, Favre threw a career-high 29 interceptions. Injuries caused the team further problems, and the season ended with a 4\u201312 record, the worst since 1991. This season was notable for two bizarre incidents. The first was during the Week 8 game in Cincinnati where a fan ran out onto the field and grabbed the ball from Favre, and during Week 12 in Philadelphia where another fan ran out and scattered the ashes of his dead mother into the air.\n\nHead coach Mike Sherman was fired at the end of the 2005 season.\n\n==2006-present: Titletown Reborn==\n\n===2006 season===\n\nIt was widely expected that Brett Favre would retire in the [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|2006]] off-season, but he eventually decided to continue playing. In addition, the team hired a new coach, [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]. The regular season started badly, with the Packers being shut out at home by the Bears. An uneven stretch followed, and again Green Bay would not reach the playoffs, going 8-8.\n\n===2007 season: Brett Favre's final season as starting quarterback===\n\n[[2007 Green Bay Packers season|2007]] witnessed a remarkable resurgence of the Packers.  They won their first four games, then fell to the Bears in Week 5.  Green Bay would go on to lose only two more regular season games: a loss to the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], and a heavy 35\u20137 defeat at [[2007 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]]. With a 13\u20133 record, Green Bay emerged at the top of the NFC North and gained a first-round bye in the playoffs. In the divisional round, they rolled over the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] 42\u201320 in a snowy home game, then advanced to the NFC Championship. Also played at Lambeau, this game pitted Green Bay against the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. With below-zero temperatures, it was one of the coldest games in NFL history, and undoubtedly affected the 38-year-old Favre's performance. The game was tied 20\u201320 at the end of regulation and went into overtime.  After two failed attempts, combined with an interception by Favre, the Giants managed a field goal from [[Lawrence Tynes]], winning 23-20 and eventually going on to win [[Super Bowl XLII]].\n\n===2008 season: Beginning of Aaron Rodgers era===\n\nIn March [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|2008]], Favre announced his retirement, and as planned, Aaron Rodgers stepped up as starting quarterback. Before the team publicly declared Rodgers their quarterback of the future, however, the team asked Favre if he was certain about retirement. If not, he would be welcome to play another year as the face of their franchise. At the time he said he was comfortable with his decision and that he would not be returning to football. But as the summer approached, Favre suddenly decided that he wasn't ready to retire after all, and petitioned NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] for a comeback. Goodell granted his request, but the Packers were ready to begin anew with Rodgers and had no interest in taking Favre back. They went so far as to offer him $25 million to stay in retirement, but he rejected it. There followed a three-week war of words between Favre and the Packers management until he threatened to sign with the Minnesota Vikings. The thought of that caused Green Bay's front office to panic, and they decided that he could join the New York Jets in exchange for a conditional draft pick. Favre complied, signaling the end of his reign in Green Bay and the beginning of the Aaron Rodgers era.\n\nThe new quarterback got off to a slow start, winning his first two games as starter over Minnesota and Detroit, then losing the next three. Then Green Bay won two against the Seahawks and Colts, afterwards losing to the Titans and Vikings.  Aside from a 37\u20133 victory over Chicago, the rest of the season was one of losses, with a final 6\u201310 record. Green Bay closed the year on an upbeat note, winning 31\u201321 over Detroit on a clear, freezing day at Lambeau and giving the Lions an [[2008 Detroit Lions season|imperfect season]].\n\n===2009 season===\n\nIn August [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|2009]], Brett Favre, after his stint with the Jets, signed with [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], provoking outrage among Packers fans. The regular season got off to a poor start, as the Packers were unable to defeat any opponents with a winning record. In Week 4, the team travelled to the Metrodome to face their former quarterback, losing 30\u201323. Following easy wins over Detroit and Cleveland, they hosted the Vikings in Week 8. Packers fans burned effigies of Favre, who was greeted by a chorus of boos and obscenities as he stepped onto Lambeau Field in the uniform of Green Bay's hated rival. Minnesota won the game handsomely, 38\u201326. The lowest point came a week later, when the Packers lost to the then-winless [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 38\u201328. After that, however, they recovered and swept through the next five games. Following a one-point loss to Pittsburgh, they defeated the Seahawks and Cardinals to secure a wild card spot in the playoffs.  This was the 16th time in the last 17 years that they had won their regular season finale. Having to face [[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona]] again in the wild card round, the Packers waged a monumental struggle and managed to tie the game 45\u201345 at the end of the regulation, sending it into overtime. Two minutes in, the Cardinals scored a touchdown on a fumble return and ended Green Bay's playoff run. With a final score of 51\u201345, the game set a record for the highest-scoring playoff game in NFL history. Throughout the season, the Packers struggled with their offensive line, which was rated the worst in the league. Aaron Rodgers was sacked 50 times in the regular season ([[Matt Flynn]] was sacked once in relief of Rodgers) and hit 93 times. In the playoff game with Arizona, he took another five sacks and ten hits.\n\n===2010 season: Super Bowl XLV championship===\n\nGreen Bay's [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|2010]] off-season was mainly concentrated on improving their faulty offensive line. In the season opener, the Packers faced an Eagles team that was playing without quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] for the first time in a decade. However, the offensive line failed to deliver again as Rodgers took three sacks in the first half and also threw an interception. Meanwhile, Philadelphia's new quarterback, [[Kevin Kolb]], was pulled with a concussion and replaced by [[Michael Vick]]. After a while, the Packers' defense adjusted to him and Green Bay pulled off a 27\u201320 win, their first in Philadelphia since 1962. Second-year linebacker Clay Matthews (who knocked Kolb down) delivered an impressive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} performance in the game. After an easy{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} win over Buffalo in Week 2, the Packers traveled to Chicago for a Monday Night matchup with their oldest rival. However, Green Bay exhibited very poor discipline and was plagued by numerous penalties, which had been a persistent problem ever since Mike McCarthy became head coach in 2006. The Packers lost the game 20\u201317. After this loss, the team returned home to face the 0-3 Lions in Week 4. They escaped with a 28\u201326 win, but it was an embarrassment{{Says who|date=August 2015}} to have given up that many points to a team that had not won in Green Bay since 1991 and which had won just two games over the last two seasons. The Packers' woes continued in Washington the next week. Clay Matthews ran Donovan McNabb down repeatedly in the first half of the game, but was then pulled with a hamstring sprain. This took most of the pressure off the Redskins' offense and the game tied at 13-13. Two minutes into overtime, Rodgers threw an interception and was knocked to the ground by Redskins defensive end Jeremy Jarmon with a concussion. Redskins kicker [[Graham Gano]] then booted a 33-yard field goal to win the game 16\u201313. Matthews and other key defensive players were missing from the Week 6 game at home versus Miami, leading to another overtime loss (23-20).\n\nIn Week 7, the injury-thinned team hosted [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on Sunday Night. Again, Brett Favre was booed by the crowd at Lambeau, but the outcome would be different this time as Green Bay took advantage of their opponent's miscues (including three Favre interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown) to win 28\u201324. Following this emotional game, the Packers gained a surprise 9\u20130 win over the 6-1 New York Jets by kicking three field goals and shutting an opponent out on the road for the first time since 1991.\n\nIn Week 9, the Packers returned home for another Sunday Night game, this time with the struggling 1-7 [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. Green Bay quickly marched out to two touchdowns in the first quarter, en route to a 45-7 crushing of their opponent. Following their bye week, the Packers headed to Minnesota for a rematch with the Vikings, who virtually laid down in much the same manner as Dallas. Green Bay quickly buried them 31\u20133, causing their head coach, [[Brad Childress]], to be fired. It was the second consecutive game in which the team that lost to the Packers fired their head coach afterwards, as [[Wade Phillips]] had been fired by the Cowboys after their loss to the Packers.\n\nNext came a difficult road battle with the 8-2 [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], in which the Packers lost a close one 20\u201317. After routing San Francisco, the Packers headed to Detroit. What looked like an easy win proved anything but when Rodgers was knocked out with a concussion during a quarterback sneak and replaced by Matt Flynn. The latter was unable to get anything going as Green Bay lost a defensive struggle 7\u20133, falling to the Lions for the first time since 2005. Rodgers was then ruled out for the Week 15 game at New England.\n\nDespite dire predictions, the Packers marched out to an early lead and the game remained close throughout.  Flynn threw three touchdown passes, but in the end, [[Tom Brady]]'s greater experience prevailed as the [[2010 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] won 31\u201327. This game was nonetheless a turning point for the Packers, having been inspired by nearly beating the best team in the NFL when no one gave them a remote chance.\n\nWith an 8\u20136 record, the Packers needed to win their last two games to gain the #6 seed, the last seed, in the NFC playoffs. The Packers easily beat the New York Giants at home 45-17 and then hosted the rival Bears for the final game of the season. The Packers won the defensive struggle 10\u20133, sealing the Packers' playoff berth.\n\nIn the wild card round, the Packers had to travel to Philadelphia to play the hot [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], led by Michael Vick. Rodgers threw for 3 touchdowns and rookie halfback [[James Starks]] had a 100+ yard running game.  [[Tramon Williams]] had an interception in the closing minutes sealing a Packer victory, 21\u201316.\n\nThe next game was against the Falcons in Atlanta.  Atlanta was the number-1 seed and was favored to beat Green Bay, but the Packers shocked the Atlanta fans by having a 28\u201314 lead at halftime, with Tramon Williams returning an interception for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Packers scored on the opening drive of the second half and the Falcons never recovered, as Green Bay rolled to a 48\u201321 win, sending the Packers to the NFC Championship game.\n\nThe NFC Championship game would be against the [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] in Chicago, in what was considered by almost everyone the biggest game ever in the Packers-Bears 90-year-old rivalry.  The game was only the second ever postseason meeting between the two storied rivals and the first playoff meeting between the teams since 1941, when they met in a one-game playoff for their division's championship, which the Bears won 33\u201314 in order to qualify for the [[1941 NFL Championship Game]], where they defeated the New York Giants.  The Packers scored on the opening drive on a touchdown run by Rodgers, and scored again in the second quarter on a run by Starks, giving the Packers a 14\u20130 lead at halftime. The defense was able to knock Bears starting quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] out of the game with a knee injury and soon after also knocked out back-up Todd Collins. In the fourth quarter, the Bears rallied with third-string quarterback [[Caleb Hanie]]. However, two key interceptions, one by defensive tackle [[B. J. Raji]] returned for a touchdown, and another by [[Sam Shields]] with less than a minute left, sealed the NFC championship for the Packers, who won 21\u201314.\n\nThe Packers played the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], who were seeking a record seventh Super Bowl title, in [[Super Bowl XLV]] at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in Arlington, Texas. The Packers struck first with two touchdowns near the end of the first quarter, one on a [[Jordy Nelson]] touchdown catch and the other on a [[Nick Collins]] interception return. Collins' touchdown marked the third consecutive playoff game in which the Packers returned an interception for a touchdown. The first half ended with the Packers leading 21\u201310, but they had lost both cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] and wide receiver [[Donald Driver]] to injury. The Steelers started to rally, but the Packers defense caused a key fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter and later stopped the Steelers on their final drive, winning their fourth Super Bowl and their record 13th overall NFL championship, 31\u201325. Aaron Rodgers was voted the game's MVP. With the win, the Packers joined the Steelers, 49ers and Cowboys as the only NFL teams to win at least four Super Bowls. They would eventually be joined by the New York Giants, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) following the 2011 season, and the New England Patriots, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLIX]]) following the 2014 season.\n\n===2011 season: 15-1 regular season===\n\nDespite a lack of practices and training due to a lockout in the off-season, the Packers defeated New Orleans 42\u201334, hosting the first game of the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011]] season. After a touch-and-go battle with Carolina in Week 2, the Packers came out on top 30\u201323. Week 3 saw the rematch with Chicago, in which Green Bay again prevailed 27\u201317 to get off to a 3\u20130 start. Green Bay breezed to another easy win over the Broncos to remain unbeaten at 4\u20130. The Packers became the only undefeated team in Week 5 when Detroit lost to San Francisco and they beat a winless Rams squad. The Packers then went on to win their next four in a row to end the first half of the season with a record of 8\u20130.\n\nIn week 12, the Giants posed to be their greatest challenge thus far. The Giants tied the game 35-35 late in the 4th quarter.  But in the last final minute, the Packers persevered and won the game on a [[Mason Crosby]] field goal. They continued their winning streak into the second half of the season, bringing them to 12-0 and assuring the Packers an appearance in the NFL's 2011 postseason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated Press|title=Rodgers engineers last-minute drive to overcome Giants, keep Packers unbeaten|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311204019}}</ref>\n\nTalk of an undefeated season finally ended in Week 15 when the Packers lost in Kansas City. Returning home, they beat an injury-depleted Bears team and while resting their starters in Week 17, Matt Flynn carried Green Bay to a wild shootout victory over Detroit. With a 15-1 finish and the #1 playoff seed, the Packers completed the 2011 regular season with the best record in franchise history.  They were the sixth, and are the most recent, team to win at least 15 games in a regular season, equaled by the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984 San Francisco 49ers]], [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings]], and [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2004 Pittsburgh Steelers]], and bettered by only the [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007 New England Patriots]], who recorded a perfect 16-0 regular season.  As they were the #1 seed, the Packers received a first-round bye and home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. After sitting out the wild-card round, Green Bay's post season came to an abrupt end in the divisional playoffs as the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (who went on to win [[Super Bowl XLVI]]) defeated them 37\u201320.\n\n===2012-2016: Playoff Struggles===\n\nIn 2012, the Packers went 11\u20135. They beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Wildcard round 24\u201310, and lost in the Divisional round 45\u201331 to the [[Super Bowl XLVII|eventual NFC champion]] San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn 2013, the Packers went 8-7-1, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 20\u201323 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn 2014, the Packers recorded their 700th victory against the Bears in week four.  The Packers are only the second team in NFL history to record 700 victories; the Bears were the first team to do it in 2010.  The team finished the regular season undefeated (8-0) in home games and 12-4 overall, and clinched the #2 seed in the NFC Playoffs.  After a first-round bye, they faced the Dallas Cowboys at home for the first time in the postseason since they won the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]].  There was a lot of hype in the week leading up to the game since during the regular season, the Packers had gone undefeated in home games while Dallas had gone undefeated in away games.  Green Bay defeated Dallas 26\u201321 to advance to the NFC Championship, where they faced the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.  After leading throughout most of regulation they lost 28\u201322 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle, who came up short in their bid for a second consecutive league title when they lost to the New England Patriots 28\u201324 in Super Bowl XLIX two weeks later.\n\nIn 2015, the Packers lost wide receiver [[Jordy Nelson]] to a torn ACL in the preseason. The Packers got off to a 6\u20130 start, but then went 1\u20134 to sit at 7-4 after Week 12. During Week 13 at Detroit, after trailing 20\u20130 in the second half, Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to tight end [[Richard Rodgers]] with no time left on the clock to [[Miracle in Motown|win the game 27-23]] after a facemask penalty was called on Detroit as time expired. The Packers clinched their seventh consecutive playoff berth with a Week 15 win at the [[Oakland Raiders]], but lost the division title to the [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]] in Week 17. With a 10\u20136 record, the Packers secured the fifth seed in the playoffs. They beat the fourth-seeded [[Washington Redskins]] on the road 35-18 and traveled to face the second-seeded [[Arizona Cardinals]]. A similar play to what happened in Week 13 at Detroit occurred in the last 5 seconds when Aaron Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass to wide receiver [[Jeff Janis]] to send the game to overtime. Unfortunately, the Packers' season ended when they lost to the Cardinals 26\u201320 in overtime.\n\nIn 2016, the Packers struggled throughout the first half of the season, sitting at 4-6 and on the verge of being eliminated from playoff contention. After their Week 10 loss at Washington, Aaron Rodgers said that the Packers could run the table and win their last six games. Despite widespread doubt of such a run, the Packers won their last six games of the season to finish the season with a 10\u20136 record and clinch the NFC North with a Week 17 win at Detroit. The Packers routed the fifth-seeded [[New York Giants]] 38\u201313 in the Wild Card round at Lambeau Field and upset the top-seeded [[Dallas Cowboys]] 34\u201331 at [[AT&T Stadium]] before falling to the second-seeded [[Atlanta Falcons]] 44\u201321 in the NFC Championship Game, which was the last NFL game ever played at the [[Georgia Dome]].\n\nIn 2017, the Packers started the season strong, going 4\u20131, until week 6, against the Minnesota Vikings. Early in the game, Aaron Rodgers was tackled hard by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, suffering a severe shoulder injury that would keep him out for the majority of the season. The Packers' offense struggled under backup quarterback Brett Hundley, losing 5 of their next 6 games, before getting back-to-back overtime victories over Tampa Bay and Cleveland. Aaron Rodgers returned for the next game, with the Packers at 7-6 and still in playoff contention. However, the Packers' attempt at a comeback against the Carolina Panthers fell short, with the Packers losing 31\u201324, eliminating them from the playoffs. Aaron Rodgers was benched for the last two games of the season, which were also Packers loses, causing the team to finish 7\u20139, their first losing season in 10 years. In the offseason, Ted Thompson, citing health issues, announced his resignation as general manager, and defensive coordinator Dom Capers was fired. Thompson was replaced with Brian Gutekunst, and Capers was replaced with Mike Pettine.\n\nThe 2018 season, which was the Packers' 100th season of existence, there was renewed hope in the Packers' rebounding, but the inconsistency with both the offense and defense caused the Packers to lose many close games, and also lose games against teams that, on paper, were supposedly worse than the Packers. The final straw came in a 20\u201317 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, which was the Cardinals' first-ever win at Lambeau Field, which also eliminated the Packers from the playoffs for the second season in a row. Head coach Mike McCarthy was promptly fired after the game, marking the first time ever the Packers had fired a coach during the regular season, and only the second time a head coach had left during the season (Gene Ronzani resigned in the middle of the 1953 season). Offensive coordinator Joe Philbin coached the Packers through the rest of the season, which finished with an even worse 6-9-1 mark.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Green Bay Packers}}\n{{NFL team history}}\n\n[[Category:Green Bay Packers]]\n[[Category:National Football League history by team|Green Bay Packers]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}\n[[Image:Old Packers Jacket Edit.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An old [[Green Bay Packers]] jacket on exhibit in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].]]\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] are a professional [[American football]] team that has played professionally in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) since 1921. The team was founded in 1919 by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]], and for the next two years played against local teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]]. In 1921, the Packers joined the ''American Professional Football Association'', the precursor to the (NFL) with Curly Lambeau as their coach. After falling into financial trouble, the Green Bay Football Corporation, now known as [[Green Bay Packers, Inc.]], was formed in 1923. The Packers became a publicly owned football team run by a board of directors elected each year. The team went on to win six NFL championships from 1929 to 1944, including three straight (1929&ndash;1931). Along the way, Curly Lambeau, with the help of receiver [[Don Hutson]], revolutionized football through the development and utilization of the forward pass.\n\nAfter Curly Lambeau resigned from the Packers in 1949, the team fell into a slump. They did not have a winning record for 11 straight seasons until 1959, the year that the Packers hired a new coach, [[Vince Lombardi]]. Lombardi would go on to lead one of the most successful teams in league history. Thirteen [[Pro Football Hall of Famers]] played for Lombardi, including quarterback [[Bart Starr]] and linebacker [[Ray Nitschke]]. The Packers lost the 1960 NFL Championship, however they would go on to win five championships in seven years under Lombardi, including three straight between 1965 and 1967. This included the infamous [[1967 NFL Championship Game|Ice Bowl]] and the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. After the passing of Curly Lambeau in 1965, the Packers new stadium (built in 1957 as ''City Stadium'') was named [[Lambeau Field]] in his honor. Five years later, the Packers second great coach, Vince Lombardi, died, just two years after leaving the team for the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1992 the Packers only made the playoffs twice. Even with former quarterback Bart Starr as head coach, the Packers were unable to regain their former glory. The team continued to falter until [[Ron Wolf]] took over as general manager. Wolf hired [[Mike Holmgren]] as head coach and traded a first-round draft pick to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. Favre would go on to lead the Packers to eleven playoffs appearances, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship in 1996. In 1997, the Packers had their fourth stock sale, expanding the number of shareholders and using the money to fund further expansion of Lambeau Field. In 2005, the Packers drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]]. After Favre left the team in 2007, Rodgers became the starter. {{As of|2017}}, he has led the Packers to eight playoffs appearances and one [[Super Bowl XLV|Super Bowl victory in 2010]]. The Packers had their fifth and most recent stock sale in 2012, again expanding the number of shareholders and using the funding to expand Lambeau Field. With a capacity of 81,441, Lambeau Field is the [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|fifth-largest stadium]] in the NFL. {{As of|2018}}, the Packers hold the record for the most NFL championships (13 total) and the second-most wins in NFL history.\n\n==Founding==\n[[File:Greenbay  packers 1920.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1920 Green Bay Packers.]]\nThe Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919, by [[Curly Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]].<ref>[http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html \"Birth of a Team and a Legend\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218235758/http://www.packers.com/history/birth-of-a-team-and-a-legend.html |date=2014-02-18 }} on Packers website</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Names |first1=Larry D |editor1-first=Greg |editor1-last=Scott |title=The History of the Green Bay Packers: The Lambes the oldest team name still in use in the NFL.}} The Green Bay Packers are the oldest NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name and the same location.</ref> Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the [[Indian Packing Company]]. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment.\n\nThe [[1919 Green Bay Packers season]] was their first season of competitive football. The club played against other teams in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] and ended the season with a 10\u20131 record, losing only to the [[Beloit Fairies]].\n\nThe team became the Acme Packers{{snd}}under the ownership of the Clair brothers{{snd}}and a professional franchise when they joined the newly formed ''American Professional Football Association'' on August 27, 1921. However, the franchise was revoked by the league at the end of the season when the Packers were revealed to have used college players in a game. As it turned out, the man who told the league of this was George Halas of the Chicago Staleys, who changed their name to the Bears the following year. This incident signaled the start of the infamous Packers-Bears rivalry. Lambeau appealed to the league and they allowed the franchise to be reinstated, though Lambeau had to pay the league entry fee of $50 to do so. Further troubles threatened to add more debt to the team, but local businessmen, known as \"[[The Hungry Five]],\" got behind the team and formed the Green Bay Football Corporation in 1923, which continues to run the franchise.\n\n==Public company==\n\nThe Packers are now the only publicly owned company with a [[Green Bay Packers Board of Directors|Board of Directors]] in American professional sports (although other teams, such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] <nowiki>[Liberty Media, previously Time Warner]</nowiki>, [[New York Rangers]] & [[New York Knicks]] <nowiki>[Cablevision]</nowiki>, the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] <nowiki>[Compuware]</nowiki>, and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] <nowiki>[Rogers Communications]</nowiki> are directly owned by publicly traded companies; additionally, three of the nine teams in [[Canada]]'s [[Canadian Football League]] exist with various forms of community ownership [the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] employ a similar ownership structure as the Packers; they have offered shares of the team periodically]). Typically, a team is owned by one person, partnership, or corporate entity; thus, a \"team owner.\" It has been speculated that this is one of the reasons the Green Bay Packers have never been moved from the city of Green Bay, a city of only 104,057 people in the 2010 census.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923205832/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html |archivedate=2006-09-23 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenbay packers 1921.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A formation of the Packers in 1921.]]\nBy comparison, the typical NFL football team city's population is in either the high hundred-thousands or the millions. The Packers, however, have long had a large following throughout [[Wisconsin]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]; in fact, for decades, the Packers played four (one pre-season, three regular-season) home games each year in [[Milwaukee]], first at the [[Wisconsin State Fair Park|State Fair Park]] fairgrounds, then at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The Packers did not move their entire home schedule to Green Bay until 1995.\n\nThe reason for ending the series of Milwaukee games, according to team president Robert Harlan, was the larger capacity of Lambeau Field and the availability of luxury boxes, which were not available at Milwaukee County Stadium.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/sports/pro-football-notebook-can-reich-again-rescue-the-bills.html | work=The New York Times | title=PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK; Can Reich Again Rescue the Bills? | first=Timothy W. | last=Smith | date=December 18, 1994 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> County Stadium's replacement, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], then being planned, was always intended to be a [[baseball park|baseball-only stadium]] instead of a multipurpose stadium; County Stadium was closed and demolished in 2001, with Miller Park opening around the same time.\n\nBased on the original \"Articles of Incorporation for the (then) Green Bay Football Corporation\" put into place in 1923, if the Packers franchise was sold, after the payment of all expenses, any remaining monies would go to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the [[American Legion]] in order to build \"a proper soldier's memorial.\" This stipulation was enacted to ensure the club remained in Green Bay and that there could never be any financial enhancement for the shareholders. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the [[Green Bay Packers Foundation]].\n\nIn 1950, the Packers held a stock sale to again raise money to support the team. In 1956, area voters approved the construction of a new stadium, owned by the city. As with its predecessor, the new field was named City Stadium, but after the death of founder Lambeau in 1965, on September 11, 1965, the stadium was renamed [[Lambeau Field]].\n\nAnother stock sale occurred late in 1997 and early in 1998. It added 105,989 new shareholders and raised over $24 million, money used for the Lambeau Field redevelopment project. Priced at $200 per share, fans bought 120,010 shares during the 17-week sale, which ended March 16, 1998. As of June 8, 2005, 111,921 people (representing 4,749,925 shares) can lay claim to a franchise ownership interest. Shares of stock include voting rights, but the redemption price is minimal, no dividends are ever paid, the stock cannot appreciate in value, and stock ownership brings no season ticket privileges.\n\nNo shareholder may own over 200,000 shares, a safeguard to ensure that no individual can assume control of the club. To run the corporation, a board of directors is elected by the stockholders. The board of directors in turn elect a seven-member Executive Committee (officers) of the corporation, consisting of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and three members-at-large. The president is the only officer to draw compensation; The balance of the committee is sitting \"gratis.\"\n\nThe team's elected president represents the Packers in NFL owners meetings unless someone else is designated. During his time as coach, [[Vince Lombardi]] generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings.\n\n==Championships==\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, more than any other American professional football team (including 4 [[Super Bowl]]s).\nTheir arch-rivals the [[Chicago Bears]] are second, with nine NFL championships (including one Super Bowl). The [[Bears-Packers rivalry|historical rivalry]] with Chicago extends to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] - the Packers have the second most Hall of Famers (21, behind the Bears' 26). The Packers are also the only team to win three straight NFL titles, which they did twice (1929&ndash;1931 and 1965&ndash;67).\n\n==The first Championships (1929-1944)==\nAfter going through modest winning seasons during most of the 1920s, the Packers began to build a championship-caliber team, as they signed three future Hall of Famers in [[John McNally (American football)|\"Johnny Blood\" McNally]], [[Cal Hubbard]], and [[Mike Michalske]]. The Packers won their first NFL Championship in 1929 with a 12-0-1 record, the only undefeated season in Packers history. Their only blemish was a tie with the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]]. The Packers were able to successfully defend their title in 1930, going 10-3-1, and won their third straight league championship in 1931 with a 12\u20132 record.  The Packers nearly won a record fourth straight championship in 1932, going 10-3-1, but finished second behind the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, who shared the best record in the league.  \n\nAs a side note, in 1928 the Packers also signed (for the third time) [[Frances Louis \u201cJug\u201d Earp]].  Jug played for Green Bay: 1922\u20131924, 1925\u20131927, & 1928\u20131932.)  He also was inducted into the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]] in 1970.  Jug and [[Wyatt Earp]] were first cousins.\n\nThe Packers scuffled in 1933 and 1934, having their first ever losing season in 1933 with a 5\u20137 record, followed by a mediocre 7-6 the following year. However, Curly Lambeau was able to build another elite team during these seasons, signing more future Hall of Famers like [[Clarke Hinkle]], [[Arnie Herber]], and most notably, receiver [[Don Hutson]] in 1935.\n\nThe Packers became a perennial championship team in the NFL for the next decade, playing in the NFL championship game four times. The Packers went a dominating 10-1-1 in 1936, defeating the [[Boston Redskins]] for the championship 21\u20136, then lost the title game to the New York Giants in 1938, then won the title back over the Giants in 1939, 27\u20130, and one more title, again over the Giants, in 1944, winning 14\u20137. The Packers stayed at the top of the standings thanks to the play of Hutson, Hinkle, Herber, another future Hall of Famer in [[Tony Canadeo]], and other standouts like [[Cecil Isbell]], [[Ted Fritsch]], [[Buckets Goldenberg]], and [[Russ Letlow]].\n\n==1945\u20131958==\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, the 1944 title season was the start of a long decline for the Packers. Following their 1944 championship, the Packers finished 6\u20134 in 1945 and 6\u20135 in 1946. After the NFL established a uniform 12-game season in 1947, Green Bay won six games, lost five, and had one tie. In 1948, the Packers fell to 3\u20139, only the second losing season in franchise history and their first since 1933. The team bottomed out in 1949 with a record of 2-10, at the time the worst season in franchise history.\n\nIn 1946, Lambeau purchased [[Rockwood Lodge]], a former [[Norbertine]] retreat 17 miles north of Green Bay, and converted it into the first self-contained training facility in pro football history, complete with living and dining facilities for the players and their families. However, the players soon grew to detest the Lodge, primarily because the practice fields sat on top of brick-hard limestone. The players took such a severe beating during practice that Lambeau sometimes had to move practices back to fields near City Stadium. According to a 2013 article in ''[[ESPN The Magazine]],'' the team's rapid on-field decline was tied in part to the unforgiving fields at the Lodge, or \"the Rock\" as the players derisively called it. Additionally, Lambeau refused to abandon the [[Notre Dame Box]], a variation of the [[single-wing formation|single wing]], long after most teams switched to running the [[T formation]].<ref name=BlazeofGlory>{{cite journal |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |title=Blaze of Glory |last=Fleming |first=David |magazine=[[ESPN The Magazine]] |date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207175756/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine |archive-date=February 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe team's problems were not limited to the on-field product. The Lodge's upkeep, combined with declining revenues from City Stadium, caused severe financial problems. By 1949, they had gotten so severe that Lambeau largely handed the team to his assistants in order to devote his full attention to the team's balance sheet. Even slashing the payroll and his own salary were not enough to staunch the bleeding. The Packers only survived the season by staging an intrasquad scrimmage with retired players on Thanksgiving Day.<ref name=\"TURB\">{{Cite news | title = Rockwood Lodge had turbulent history | last = Hendricks | first = Martin | url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/ | date = August 18, 2016 | access-date = March 8, 2019 | df = mdy | url-status = live | newspaper = [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] | archive-date = August 24, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160824012535/https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2016/08/18/rockwood-lodge-had-turbulent-existence/88904044/}}</ref>\n\nAll of this chilled Lambeau's already deteriorating relationship with the Packers management. After giving him a free hand for most of the last three decades, several team executives revolted at the exorbitant costs of buying and renovating Rockwood Lodge; some members of the financial committee almost resigned. Lambeau also rankled fans by spending most of his offseasons on \"recruiting trips\" far from Wisconsin. He arrived in Green Bay for the 1946 season sporting tailored suits, saddle shoes and a cigarette holder, leading fans to call him \"the Earl of Hollywood.\"<ref name=BlazeofGlory/>\n\nBy the end of the 1949 season, the Packers were on a seemingly irreversible slide toward bankruptcy. Rumors abounded that the league would use the impending merger with the [[All-America Football Conference]] as an excuse to force the Packers to either move or fold. Amid this, Lambeau tracked down four investors who were willing to pump $200,000 into the team\u2013provided that the franchise become privately held once again. This proposal was considered rank heresy in Green Bay. Many fans and executives believed NFL officials were pressuring Lambeau to move the team to the West Coast. In response, team president [[Emil R. Fischer]] tendered Lambeau a two-year contract extension that would have stripped Lambeau of all authority over non-football matters. Lambeau rejected the offer out of hand, effectively ending his tenure at the helm of the franchise that he founded.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/>\n\nLambeau formally resigned on February 1, 1950,<ref name=clqtctc>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Curly Lambeau quits to coach the Cardinals |date=February 1, 1950 |page=1, part 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120134159/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WOMpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C11134 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Lambeau quits for Card job; Isbell seeks Packer post |date=February 2, 1950 |page=5, part 2 |access-date=November 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120133319/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nE9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7269%2C4720741 |archive-date=November 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> a little over a week after Rockwood Lodge burned to the ground. Rumors have long abounded that a Packers employee set the fire, though interviews with the family of caretaker Melvin Flagstad and other team officials of the time suggested it was caused by electrical problems. What is beyond dispute is that the $75,000 insurance payout helped pull the team from the financial brink.<ref name=BlazeofGlory/><ref name=\"TURB\"/> \n\nEven with the insurance money, the Packers were still struggling both on and off the field. A bond drive was issued in 1950, which raised $118,000 for the struggling team. [[Gene Ronzani]] replaced Lambeau as coach, and the team began using the green and gold colored uniforms that have been worn ever since. Green Bay won three games that season and in 1951. Ronzani's efforts to rebuild the team were severely hampered by the onset of the [[Korean War]]. However, led by a talented crop of rookies, the Packers got out to a 6\u20133 start in 1952 and were in playoff contention for most of the season. However, they closed they year with a three-game losing streak to end the season. A loss to Detroit in the final game left them in fourth place.<ref name=Guilbrandsen>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PpXQ19EQMzcC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=I+want+it+understood+that+I+am+in+complete+command+Lombardi&source=bl&ots=qUFl8BNpL4&sig=ACfU3U2VebI4nWJHITgeuXjDCk6GEaTXTw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHz8Tm6-_mAhUEheAKHfs3AAgQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=I%20want%20it%20understood%20that%20I%20am%20in%20complete%20command%20Lombardi&f=false|title=Green Bay Packers: The Complete Illustrated History - Third Edition|author1=Don Guilbrandsen|publisher=[[Voyageur Press]]|date=2011|isbn=1616731486}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the issue of a new stadium began to crop up. City Stadium had long been known to be an extremely inadequate facility. The wooden stadium, adjacent to [[Green Bay East High School|East High School]], seated only 25,000 people and could not be expanded. The Packers had to use East High's locker room facilities, while the visiting team usually dressed at their hotel. Since the 1930s, the Packers had begun playing some home games in [[Milwaukee]]. By the time [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] opened in 1953, the Packers played two or three home games a year in Milwaukee.\n\nThe first game played at MCS was a 27\u20130 shutout at the hands of Cleveland, after which the Packers finished 1953 2-7-1. Ronzani was forced to resign with two games left in the season. [[Verne Llewellyn]] took over as GM in 1954 and [[Lisle Blackbourn]] of [[Marquette University]] was hired as head coach, but the Packers won four games that season. A 6\u20136 record in 1955 again put the team in postseason contention, but a loss to the Bears sent them home. The Packers fell back to 4\u20138 in 1956, a season most noteworthy for the drafting of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] QB [[Bart Starr]].\n\nBy then, the question of the Packers' staying in Green Bay was becoming acute. More and more opponents began asking for their games against the Packers to be played at County Stadium, which was almost double the size of City Stadium. League officials gave the Packers an ultimatum\u2013get a new stadium or move to Milwaukee full-time. Buoyed in part by a strong finish to the 1955 season, the people of Green Bay overwhelmingly passed a bond issue for a brand-new 32,000-seat stadium, naming it [[Lambeau Field|New City Stadium]]. The new stadium was dedicated in a game against the Chicago Bears. The Packers won the game, 21\u201317, but finished the season 3\u20139.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>  \n\nBlackbourn was fired after the season and the coaching job was given to longtime assistant [[Ray McLean|Ray \"Scooter\" McLean]]. By this time, however, the once-proud franchise had become notorious as a dumping ground for players who either underperformed on the field or flouted team rules. Under the circumstances, the 1957 season was an unmitigated disaster. The Packers finished 1\u201310\u20131, the worst record in franchise history. McLean promptly resigned.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\nAmid growing concern inside and outside of Green Bay about the state of the team, the Packers then made what proved to be the most important hire in the history of the franchise, hiring [[Vince Lombardi]], the offensive coordinator of the dominating [[New York Giants]], as head coach and general manager. Lombardi demanded and got complete authority over football operations. Reinforcing the message, when he arrived in Green Bay, he told the executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command around here.\" The message applied to the players as well. Lombardi ran his first training camp as a harsh taskmaster, but the players quickly bought in, setting the stage for the decade to come.<ref name=Guilbrandsen/>\n\n==Lombardi era (1959-1967)==\n\nThe Packers of the 1960s were one of the most dominant NFL teams of all time. Coach [[Vince Lombardi]] took over a last-place team in 1959 and built it into a juggernaut, winning five league championships over a seven-year span culminating with victories in the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. During the Lombardi era, the Packers had a group of legendary stars: the offense was led by quarterback [[Bart Starr]], [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]], [[Carroll Dale]], [[Paul Hornung]], [[Forrest Gregg]], [[Fuzzy Thurston]] and [[Jerry Kramer]]; the defense was led by the likes of [[Willie Davis (American football)|Willie Davis]], [[Henry Jordan]], [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]], [[Ray Nitschke]], [[Dave Robinson (American football)|Dave Robinson]], and [[Herb Adderley]].\n\nSeveral other factors helped the Packers return to success. After Pete Rozelle became NFL Commissioner in 1960, he made sure that every franchise got all its games broadcast on television, as up to that point only big-market teams like the Bears and Giants enjoyed this privilege. TV helped raise revenue for small-market teams like Green Bay, and also there was the introduction of [[revenue sharing]], which ensured that no NFL franchise would have to worry about bankruptcy.\n\nThe greatness of the Packers of the '60s really began [[1959 Green Bay Packers season|one year earlier]] with the hiring of Lombardi. In their first game under Lombardi on September 27, 1959, the Packers beat the heavily favored [[1959 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 9\u20136 at Lambeau Field. The Packers got off to a 3&ndash;0 start before losing the next five, but then won their last four games to achieve their first winning season in 12 years since [[1947 Green Bay Packers season|1947]], ultimately finishing 7\u20135. A 21\u20130 shutout of Washington on November 22 was the last Packers game to date that did not sell out.\n\n[[1960 Green Bay Packers season|The next year in 1960]], the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, finished 8-4 and won their first division title since 1944 during the height of World War II.  They also contested the NFL championship game for the first time since that year.  They won the NFL West Title and played in the [[1960 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] at [[Franklin Field|Philadelphia]]. In a see-saw game the Packers trailed the Eagles by four points late in the game. The Packers began their final drive, aiming for glory, but it was not to be as [[Chuck Bednarik]] tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time ran out. Philadelphia won the championship, 17\u201313. In the locker room after the game, Lombardi told his men that this would be the last time the Packers would lose the championship game with him at the helm. That prediction became fact, as the Packers would never again lose the [[List of NFL champions (1920\u20131969)|NFL Championship Game]] under Lombardi.  This, in fact, would be Vince Lombardi's only postseason loss.\n\nAfter going 11-3 the [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|following season]] in the [[1961 NFL season|NFL's]] newly expanded 14-game schedule, the Packers again won their division and returned to the [[1961 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], as they faced the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], this time at New City Stadium. This time the game was no contest; the Packers exploded for 24 2nd quarter points as Paul Hornung, having recently returned from the [[United States Army|Army]], scored an NFL Championship record 19 points. The Packers shut out the Giants 37\u20130 to win their first championship since [[1944 NFL Championship Game|1944]] and their 7th total.\n\nNot resting on their 1961 Championship, the Packers stormed back in [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|1962]], jumping out to a 10&ndash;0 start en route to an amazing 13&ndash;1 season. This included a rematch with the Eagles in Franklin Field. Green Bay avenged the 1960 championship game by snuffing their opponent 49\u20130 in a game widely referred to as \"Lombardi's Revenge\". It would be the last Packers victory in Philadelphia until 2010. They reached the championship game again, this time in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The Packers faced the [[1962 New York Giants season|Giants]] in a much more brutal [[1962 NFL Championship Game|championship game]] than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the surprising foot of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. They ground down the Giants 16&ndash;7 and Titletown U.S.A. reigned supreme.\n\nA three-peat eluded Green Bay in [[1963 Green Bay Packers season|1963]] as RB Paul Hornung was suspended by the league for betting on games. Without him, the team still finished 11-2-1, but was swept by the Bears, who won the division and ultimately the championship. The Packers were then forced into the embarrassing situation of having to go to Miami for the so-called \"Playoff Bowl\", an exhibition game the NFL held every January during 1960-69 between the second-place finishers of each conference. They beat Cleveland 40\u201323, but Vince Lombardi was not happy about it, calling the Playoff Bowl \"The Shit Bowl. A loser's game for losers. Because that's all second place is.\"\n\nThe Packers appeared to have run out of gas in [[1964 Green Bay Packers season|1964]], winning only eight games, losing five, and having one tie. Again they had to contest the meaningless Playoff Bowl in Miami, this time with the Cardinals, who won 24\u201317. Lombardi was again infuriated, calling it \"a rinky-dink game in a rinky-dink town between two rinky-dink teams.\"\n\n===1965 season===\nDuring the 1965 off-season, Curly Lambeau died and the Packers renamed New City Stadium Lambeau Field in his honor.  After a two-year absence from championship football, the [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|Pack]] was back in [[1965 NFL season|1965]]. The Packers rebounded by winning ten games and losing three.  They won some crucial games, including a 42&ndash;27 win over the [[1965 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], a contest in which Paul Hornung (coming back from a betting scandal and injuries) scored five touchdowns. But, the season ender with San Francisco was a tie, forcing them to play the Colts at home in a playoff for the Western Conference title. A close defensive struggle, the game would be remembered for [[Don Chandler]]'s controversial field goal in which the ball possibly went wide right, but the official raised his arms to grant the three points. The two teams tied at 10-10 and went into overtime, where Green Bay won it on a 25-yard Chandler FG. The disputed win sent the Packers to the NFL Championship Game at home, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the [[1965 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], helping the Packers defeat the Browns 23\u201312 to earn their 3rd NFL Championship under Lombardi.\n\n===1966 and 1967 seasons and first two Super Bowls===\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis.jpg|right|thumb|The Packers and the Chiefs in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship game. (Super Bowl I)]]\n[[1966 NFL season|1966]] would prove one of the most important years ever for both the Packers and the NFL as a whole. In 1959, Lamar Hunt and several others, frustrated at the league's lack of interest in expansion, began a rival organization, the American Football League. The AFL was initially laughed at by the NFL, but by 1965 were a serious competitor and began engaging in bidding wars for top college players. This culminated in the New York Jets offering Alabama QB Joe Namath a then unheard of $400,000 contract. During the spring of 1966, NFL and AFL heads met and agreed to an eventual merger into one big league, but only when the latter was deemed up to parity. Until then, the champions of both leagues would meet on a neutral site in January to determine the ultimate champion.\n\nThe Packers meanwhile had one of the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|finest seasons in franchise history]], finishing 12-2 and with Bart Starr being named league MVP. They met the Eastern Conference winner [[1966 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the Cotton Bowl for the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship]]. This celebrated game saw the Packers win 34\u201327. The Packers went on to defeat the AFL's [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 35\u201310 in [[Super Bowl I|the first ever Super Bowl]] (then called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game) at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum|L.A. Coliseum]]. Bart Starr was named the game's MVP.\n\n[[1967 Green Bay Packers season|1967]] marked Vince Lombardi's final triumph. The Packers team was visibly aging, and they finished 9-4-1. However, they still proved all-but-invincible at home as they beat the 11-1-2 [[1967 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 28\u20137 in Milwaukee to again contest the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|league championship]] with [[1967 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]]. This game at Lambeau Field became known as the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]] due to the frigid weather conditions. But again, Green Bay prevailed with a score of 21\u201317.  The Packers now had to [[Super Bowl II|face the AFL champions]] (this time the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]) in Miami's [[Orange Bowl]]. By this point, Lombardi and the team were much more confident of victory as they easily beat Oakland 33\u201314. Again, Starr was named the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nBy winning the 1967 NFL Championship Game, the Packers achieved a \"three-peat\" (three consecutive league championships) for only the second time in franchise history and the first time since they were named league champions following the 1929\u201331 seasons.  To this day, no other NFL team has matched or surpassed this record.  The Packers' back-to-back wins in the first two Super Bowls remains a Super Bowl record, and has since been tied seven times by six other franchises: the Miami Dolphins won Super Bowls VII and VIII following the 1972 and 1973 seasons, the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowls IX and X following the 1974 and 1975 seasons as well as Super Bowls XIII and XIV following the 1978 and 1979 seasons and remain, to date, the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowl titles more than once, the San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV following the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII following the 1992 and 1993 seasons, the Denver Broncos won Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII following the 1997 and 1998 seasons, and most recently, the New England Patriots won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX following the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\nAfter the franchise's victory in [[Super Bowl II]], Vince Lombardi announced that he was stepping down as head coach, although he would retain the title of general manager. [[Phil Bengtson]] took his place.\n\n==The second \"Dark Ages\" (1968-1991)==\nPredictably, the [[1968 Green Bay Packers season|1968 season]] did not see an impressive performance from the Packers (6-7-1) as Bengtson proved unable to fill Lombardi's shoes and key players retired. Meanwhile, an exhausted Vince Lombardi announced his retirement from football altogether, and Phil Bengtson assumed the GM position. The Packers improved to 8\u20136 in [[1969 Green Bay Packers season|1969]], but players continued to retire.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince Lombardi had been seduced out of retirement by the Redskins, who made him HC and 50% owner of that team. He led them to a [[1969 Washington Redskins season|7-5-2 record in 1969]], thus preserving his streak of having never coached a team to a losing season. However, Lombardi fell ill with cancer during the 1970 off-season and died at the age of 57.\n\nThe newly merged NFL named the Super Bowl trophy in his honor, and the street in front of Lambeau Field was named Lombardi Avenue. Meanwhile, the Packers finished [[1970 Green Bay Packers season|1970]] 6\u20138, which included being shut out by Detroit twice. Dejected at his inability to match the standards of his illustrious predecessor, Phil Bengtson resigned as head coach. [[Dan Devine]] assumed the job and began the task of replacing the '60s players with fresh, young talent. Bart Starr himself was the last to go after starting in only four games during [[1971 Green Bay Packers season|1971]] in which he threw three interceptions, scored one rushing touchdown, and had 24 completions in 45 attempts. Most of the work in 1971 was done by newly drafted QB Scott Hunter, and at the close of the season, Starr retired at the age of 36.\n\nPoor drafting of players was a key reason for why the Packers had little success for almost a quarter of a century after Lombardi's departure.  To cite a few examples, in the first round of the [[1972 NFL Draft|1972 draft]], when future Hall of Fame running back [[Franco Harris]] was still available, the Packers instead chose mediocre quarterback [[Jerry Tagge]]. In [[1981 NFL Draft|1981]], when no fewer than three future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] defenders were still available -- [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Mike Singletary]], and [[Howie Long]], the Packers chose another mediocre quarterback, [[Rich Campbell (American football)|Rich Campbell]]. Finally, in [[1989 NFL Draft|1989]], when such future legends as [[Barry Sanders]], [[Deion Sanders]], and [[Derrick Thomas]] were available, the Packers chose offensive lineman [[Tony Mandarich]]. Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations.\n\nAlthough the Packers would not have winning success until [[1992 NFL season|1992]], there were moments when the Packers at times resembled the old Packer days of the 1960s. In [[1972 Green Bay Packers season|1972]], led by workhorse running backs [[John Brockington]] and new Packer [[MacArthur Lane]], and a sturdy defense that featured rookie [[Willie Buchanon]], the Packers captured the NFC Central Division Title with a 10&ndash;4 record. That team would lose in the playoffs to the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 16\u20133. In [[1975 Green Bay Packers season|1975]] under new head coach Bart Starr the Packers won only 4 games, but in one of those wins, the Packers beat the eventual 1975 NFC Champion [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 19&ndash;17 on October 19 in Dallas.\n\n[[1976 Green Bay Packers season|1976]] was another losing campaign, with the Packers only achieving a 5\u20139 record, the lowest in their division. The team dropped back to a 4\u201310 season in [[1977 Green Bay Packers season|1977]]. The frequent changes of quarterbacks during this period was indicative of Green Bay's troubles. When the NFL expanded the regular season to 16 games the following year, the team won six of its first seven matches, but largely due to an easy schedule. After the Packers began facing tougher opponents, the wins dried up and the final record for [[1978 Green Bay Packers season|1978]] was 8-7-1.\n\nThe Packers had another 1,000 yard rusher in [[Terdell Middleton]]: he rushed for 1,116 yards. In the early 1980s, the Packers had a star-studded aerial attack led by quarterback [[Lynn Dickey]] and wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[John Jefferson]].\n\nWhile the 1978 season had raised the morale of Packers fans, it did not last, for the team finished with a 5\u201311 record in [[1979 Green Bay Packers season|1979]], and a 5-10-1 showing during an injury-plagued [[1980 Green Bay Packers season|1980]] season. In [[1981 Green Bay Packers season|1981]], the Packers came close to the playoffs, but lost the final game of the season, a road match against the [[1980 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], and ended up with an 8\u20138 record.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers only qualified for the playoffs twice ([[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1972]] and [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982]] [''pictured'']) during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969-1991).]]\nAfter the [[1982 Green Bay Packers season|1982]] season was reduced to nine games by a players' strike, the NFL held a special playoff tournament with the eight best teams in each conference. The 5-3-1 Packers qualified for this, routing the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season |Cardinals]] 41\u201316, but in the next round lost to the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] 37\u201326. It would be their only playoff win during this rough stretch in the team's history. Another [[1983 Green Bay Packers season|8-8 season]] the following year led to the dismissal of Bart Starr as head coach. [[Forrest Gregg]] succeeded him, but after two more 8\u20138 seasons, he decided to cut several aging players and start over with fresh rookies. The rejuvenated Packers produced a 4\u201312 record in [[1986 Green Bay Packers season|1986]], as was typical of a rebuilding period.\n\nAnother strike affected the NFL in [[1987 Green Bay Packers season|1987]], resulting in a 15-game season. During the strike, the league used substitute players. The Packers fill-ins won one game and lost two before the regulars returned, but in the end the struggling team managed only a 5-9-1 record. Afterwards, Forrest Gregg resigned and was replaced by [[Lindy Infante]]. Still, the team continued to struggle, going 4\u201312 in [[1988 Green Bay Packers season|1988]].\n\nWith such a weak record, the Packers gained the privilege of first-round draft picks during the 1989 off-season. They selected Michigan State offensive tackle [[Tony Mandarich]], who was getting considerable publicity due to his huge 325-pound frame. Mandarich (who later admitted to using steroids in college) proved a poor choice in the end, and after three seasons of mediocre performance was cut. The [[1989 Green Bay Packers season|1989 campaign]] was the best in 17 years, with the Packers compiling a 10\u20136 record (including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXIV]] Champion [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]]), but still missing the playoffs. There followed another two losing seasons, with 6-10 and 4-12 records. A general overhaul took place during the 1992 off-season, with [[Mike Holmgren]] replacing Lindy Infante. Most importantly however, the Packers acquired second-year quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]].\n\n==1992-1997: A new golden era==\n\nFavre would get off to a slow start, losing five of his first seven games, but afterwards won six in a row. The Packers finished [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|1992]] with a 9\u20137 record. In the [[1993 Green Bay Packers season|1993]] off-season, the team signed free-agent defensive end [[Reggie White]]. After another slow start, the Packers swept ahead for a 9\u20137 record, reaching the playoffs for the first time in eleven years. In the NFC wild card round, they faced the [[1993 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]], who had beaten them the previous week. In a close game, Favre led the team to a 28\u201324 victory, but in the divisional playoff round Green Bay was overwhelmed 27-17 by the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], the eventual Super Bowl winner. Brett Favre would also make the Pro Bowl following that season.\n\nThe [[1994 Green Bay Packers season|1994 season]] was a near-rerun of the previous year. Again the Packers went 9\u20137, beat the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 16\u201312 in the NFC wild card round, and lost the divisional game 35\u20139 to the [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. In [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|1995]], Favre continued to cement his reputation as one of the NFL's finest quarterbacks, passing for 4,413 yards and scoring 38 touchdown passes during the team's 11-5 regular season. The Packers reached the top of the NFC Central division for the first time since 1971. However, they still had to go through the wildcard round, overpowering [[1995 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] 37\u201320. The divisional round saw them knock out the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 27\u201317, but they were again frustrated by the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]], who triumphed 38\u201327 in the NFC Championship game and went on to win another Super Bowl title.\n\nAs the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|1996 season]] began, the Packers were more determined than ever to reach the Super Bowl. Beginning with an eight-game winning streak, they faced the hated [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] during Week 11 on a Monday Night game. The Packers suffered a smarting loss, the score being 21\u20136. After this, they won the last five regular season games, finishing with a record of 13\u20133. Reaching the top of the NFC Central division, they were able to skip the wild card round this time. In the divisional playoff, they easily defeated [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] at Lambeau, with a score of 35\u201314. Meanwhile, the Cowboys had lost to the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], and so the Packers would have to face this two-year-old expansion team in the NFC Championship match. The Packers beat them 30\u201313 to advance to Super Bowl XXXI.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXI===\n\nFacing Green Bay in the New Orleans Superdome in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] were the AFC champion [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In a see-saw game, the Packers gained a 27\u201314 lead at halftime, which they never lost despite a valiant effort by their opponent. The final score was 35\u201321, and Green Bay had won its first championship since 1967.  Kick returner [[Desmond Howard]], who returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown late in the 3rd quarter, was named the game's MVP, becoming the first (and to date, only) Super Bowl MVP on the merits of special teams play.\n\nThe defending champions would have an easy go of the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|1997 season]], which saw a record of 13\u20133. Brett Favre passed for 3,867 yards and was named the league's MVP third year in a row. In their fifth consecutive playoff appearance, the Packers rolled over the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20137 in the divisional round, then beat the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] 23\u201310 in the NFC Championship to make the Super Bowl for the second year in a row.\n\n===Super Bowl XXXII===\n\nPlaying in San Diego's [[Qualcomm Stadium]] for [[Super Bowl XXXII]], the Packers would this time engage the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], who had lost in all their previous Super Bowl appearances. In a game that was even more see-saw than Super Bowl XXXI, Denver had taken the lead in the 4th quarter, with a score of 24\u201317.  Denver took its final lead with under 2 minutes in the game when head coach Mike Holmgren intentionally allowed [[Terrell Davis]] to score the go-ahead touchdown.  In the final minute of the game, Brett Favre threw a desperate pass at tight end [[Mark Chmura]], but it failed and the Broncos walked home with the Lombardi Trophy, ending a 13-year losing streak for the AFC in the Super Bowl.\n\n==1998-2005: Near Successes ==\n[[Image:Bubba Franks88-Edit.jpg|thumb|Former Packers' tight end [[Bubba Franks]], 2007]]\nStill playing strong football, the Packers compiled an 11\u20135 record in [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|1998]], but suffered several key injuries. They made the playoffs for the sixth year in a row, but this time as a wild card. Again, Green Bay faced its perennial foe the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], but luck would not be on their side this time, as they lost a close game, 30\u201327, on a [[Terrell Owens]] touchdown catch with 3 seconds remaining.  Afterwards, Mike Holmgren stepped down as head coach and was succeeded by [[Ray Rhodes]]. The Packers only managed an 8-8 showing in [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|1999]] and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1992, despite a high-scoring season-ending performance against Arizona in an attempt to win a potential points-scored tiebreaker. Rhodes was quickly dumped and replaced by Mike Sherman.  In [[2000 Green Bay Packers season|2000]], the Packers finished 9\u20137, but again did not make the playoffs.\n\nGreen Bay rebounded nicely in [[2001 Green Bay Packers season|2001]], going 12-4 and returning to the playoffs as a wild card. Per established practice, they challenged the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] and beat them 25\u201315, avenging their playoff loss three years earlier. There would be no Super Bowl appearance though, as Green Bay was crushed by the [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in the divisional round 45\u201317. Favre threw a record six interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. The [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|following year]] began strongly, with the Packers starting 8\u20131. Divisional realignment had placed them along with Minnesota, Chicago, and Detroit in the new NFC North. Being the only team in their division to achieve a record above .500 in 2002, the Packers seemed a virtual shoo-in for the first-round bye. However, they lost the final game of the season at the [[2002 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], which gave Green Bay the #3 NFC seed and forced them to go through the wild card round.  The playoffs would have a humiliating end as the Packers were routed 27-7 by the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] on a snow-covered Lambeau Field for the franchise's first-ever home playoff loss.\n\n[[2003 Green Bay Packers season|2003]] began rather badly.  Lambeau Field had been renovated that year, but in the season opener, the Packers lost to the [[2003 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 30\u201325.  Brett Favre suffered several injuries during the season, and also had to deal with the death of his father on the eve of a Monday Night trip to Oakland.  However, Favre started, and put up an impressive performance as the Packers trounced the [[2003 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 41\u20137. The Packers went into the final week needing to win and the Vikings to lose to win the NFC North in order to get the last playoff spot.  The Packers beat the [[2003 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] while the [[2003 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] rallied in the final seconds to beat the Vikings, giving the Packers the NFC North championship with an 11\u20135 record. The wild card round saw a fierce struggle with the [[2003 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], which tied 27-27 and went into overtime.  Defensive back Al Harris intercepted a pass from former Packer quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] and returned it 52 yards for a touchdown, giving the Packers the win. In the divisional round, the Packers lost to [[2003 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia]]. That game also went into overtime, tied 17-17, but Favre threw a pass up into the air that was intercepted by Eagles safety [[Brian Dawkins]]. Several plays later, the Eagles kicked a field goal and won 20\u201317.\n\nIn [[2004 Green Bay Packers season|2004]], Green Bay compiled a 10\u20136 season and reached the playoffs as a wildcard, but lost to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] 31\u201317 in the first-ever playoff meeting between the two rivals.\n\nDuring the [[2005 Green Bay Packers season|2005]] off-season, the team drafted quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] from California. Rodgers was intended to be the eventual successor to Favre, now 36 years old and showing his age by turning in a poor performance that year. Despite a devastating 52\u20133 win over New Orleans in Week 5, Favre threw a career-high 29 interceptions. Injuries caused the team further problems, and the season ended with a 4\u201312 record, the worst since 1991. This season was notable for two bizarre incidents. The first was during the Week 8 game in Cincinnati where a fan ran out onto the field and grabbed the ball from Favre, and during Week 12 in Philadelphia where another fan ran out and scattered the ashes of his dead mother into the air.\n\nHead coach Mike Sherman was fired at the end of the 2005 season.\n\n==2006-present: Titletown Reborn==\n\n===2006 season===\n\nIt was widely expected that Brett Favre would retire in the [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|2006]] off-season, but he eventually decided to continue playing. In addition, the team hired a new coach, [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]. The regular season started badly, with the Packers being shut out at home by the Bears. An uneven stretch followed, and again Green Bay would not reach the playoffs, going 8-8.\n\n===2007 season: Brett Favre's final season as starting quarterback===\n\n[[2007 Green Bay Packers season|2007]] witnessed a remarkable resurgence of the Packers.  They won their first four games, then fell to the Bears in Week 5.  Green Bay would go on to lose only two more regular season games: a loss to the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], and a heavy 35\u20137 defeat at [[2007 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]]. With a 13\u20133 record, Green Bay emerged at the top of the NFC North and gained a first-round bye in the playoffs. In the divisional round, they rolled over the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] 42\u201320 in a snowy home game, then advanced to the NFC Championship. Also played at Lambeau, this game pitted Green Bay against the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. With below-zero temperatures, it was one of the coldest games in NFL history, and undoubtedly affected the 38-year-old Favre's performance. The game was tied 20\u201320 at the end of regulation and went into overtime.  After two failed attempts, combined with an interception by Favre, the Giants managed a field goal from [[Lawrence Tynes]], winning 23-20 and eventually going on to win [[Super Bowl XLII]].\n\n===2008 season: Beginning of Aaron Rodgers era===\n\nIn March [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|2008]], Favre announced his retirement, and as planned, Aaron Rodgers stepped up as starting quarterback. Before the team publicly declared Rodgers their quarterback of the future, however, the team asked Favre if he was certain about retirement. If not, he would be welcome to play another year as the face of their franchise. At the time he said he was comfortable with his decision and that he would not be returning to football. But as the summer approached, Favre suddenly decided that he wasn't ready to retire after all, and petitioned NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] for a comeback. Goodell granted his request, but the Packers were ready to begin anew with Rodgers and had no interest in taking Favre back. They went so far as to offer him $25 million to stay in retirement, but he rejected it. There followed a three-week war of words between Favre and the Packers management until he threatened to sign with the Minnesota Vikings. The thought of that caused Green Bay's front office to panic, and they decided that he could join the New York Jets in exchange for a conditional draft pick. Favre complied, signaling the end of his reign in Green Bay and the beginning of the Aaron Rodgers era.\n\nThe new quarterback got off to a slow start, winning his first two games as starter over Minnesota and Detroit, then losing the next three. Then Green Bay won two against the Seahawks and Colts, afterwards losing to the Titans and Vikings.  Aside from a 37\u20133 victory over Chicago, the rest of the season was one of losses, with a final 6\u201310 record. Green Bay closed the year on an upbeat note, winning 31\u201321 over Detroit on a clear, freezing day at Lambeau and giving the Lions an [[2008 Detroit Lions season|imperfect season]].\n\n===2009 season===\n\nIn August [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|2009]], Brett Favre, after his stint with the Jets, signed with [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], provoking outrage among Packers fans. The regular season got off to a poor start, as the Packers were unable to defeat any opponents with a winning record. In Week 4, the team travelled to the Metrodome to face their former quarterback, losing 30\u201323. Following easy wins over Detroit and Cleveland, they hosted the Vikings in Week 8. Packers fans burned effigies of Favre, who was greeted by a chorus of boos and obscenities as he stepped onto Lambeau Field in the uniform of Green Bay's hated rival. Minnesota won the game handsomely, 38\u201326. The lowest point came a week later, when the Packers lost to the then-winless [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 38\u201328. After that, however, they recovered and swept through the next five games. Following a one-point loss to Pittsburgh, they defeated the Seahawks and Cardinals to secure a wild card spot in the playoffs.  This was the 16th time in the last 17 years that they had won their regular season finale. Having to face [[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona]] again in the wild card round, the Packers waged a monumental struggle and managed to tie the game 45\u201345 at the end of the regulation, sending it into overtime. Two minutes in, the Cardinals scored a touchdown on a fumble return and ended Green Bay's playoff run. With a final score of 51\u201345, the game set a record for the highest-scoring playoff game in NFL history. Throughout the season, the Packers struggled with their offensive line, which was rated the worst in the league. Aaron Rodgers was sacked 50 times in the regular season ([[Matt Flynn]] was sacked once in relief of Rodgers) and hit 93 times. In the playoff game with Arizona, he took another five sacks and ten hits.\n\n===2010 season: Super Bowl XLV championship===\n\nGreen Bay's [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|2010]] off-season was mainly concentrated on improving their faulty offensive line. In the season opener, the Packers faced an Eagles team that was playing without quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] for the first time in a decade. However, the offensive line failed to deliver again as Rodgers took three sacks in the first half and also threw an interception. Meanwhile, Philadelphia's new quarterback, [[Kevin Kolb]], was pulled with a concussion and replaced by [[Michael Vick]]. After a while, the Packers' defense adjusted to him and Green Bay pulled off a 27\u201320 win, their first in Philadelphia since 1962. Second-year linebacker Clay Matthews (who knocked Kolb down) delivered an impressive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} performance in the game. After an easy{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}} win over Buffalo in Week 2, the Packers traveled to Chicago for a Monday Night matchup with their oldest rival. However, Green Bay exhibited very poor discipline and was plagued by numerous penalties, which had been a persistent problem ever since Mike McCarthy became head coach in 2006. The Packers lost the game 20\u201317. After this loss, the team returned home to face the 0-3 Lions in Week 4. They escaped with a 28\u201326 win, but it was an embarrassment{{Says who|date=August 2015}} to have given up that many points to a team that had not won in Green Bay since 1991 and which had won just two games over the last two seasons. The Packers' woes continued in Washington the next week. Clay Matthews ran Donovan McNabb down repeatedly in the first half of the game, but was then pulled with a hamstring sprain. This took most of the pressure off the Redskins' offense and the game tied at 13-13. Two minutes into overtime, Rodgers threw an interception and was knocked to the ground by Redskins defensive end Jeremy Jarmon with a concussion. Redskins kicker [[Graham Gano]] then booted a 33-yard field goal to win the game 16\u201313. Matthews and other key defensive players were missing from the Week 6 game at home versus Miami, leading to another overtime loss (23-20).\n\nIn Week 7, the injury-thinned team hosted [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on Sunday Night. Again, Brett Favre was booed by the crowd at Lambeau, but the outcome would be different this time as Green Bay took advantage of their opponent's miscues (including three Favre interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown) to win 28\u201324. Following this emotional game, the Packers gained a surprise 9\u20130 win over the 6-1 New York Jets by kicking three field goals and shutting an opponent out on the road for the first time since 1991.\n\nIn Week 9, the Packers returned home for another Sunday Night game, this time with the struggling 1-7 [[2010 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]]. Green Bay quickly marched out to two touchdowns in the first quarter, en route to a 45-7 crushing of their opponent. Following their bye week, the Packers headed to Minnesota for a rematch with the Vikings, who virtually laid down in much the same manner as Dallas. Green Bay quickly buried them 31\u20133, causing their head coach, [[Brad Childress]], to be fired. It was the second consecutive game in which the team that lost to the Packers fired their head coach afterwards, as [[Wade Phillips]] had been fired by the Cowboys after their loss to the Packers.\n\nNext came a difficult road battle with the 8-2 [[2010 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], in which the Packers lost a close one 20\u201317. After routing San Francisco, the Packers headed to Detroit. What looked like an easy win proved anything but when Rodgers was knocked out with a concussion during a quarterback sneak and replaced by Matt Flynn. The latter was unable to get anything going as Green Bay lost a defensive struggle 7\u20133, falling to the Lions for the first time since 2005. Rodgers was then ruled out for the Week 15 game at New England.\n\nDespite dire predictions, the Packers marched out to an early lead and the game remained close throughout.  Flynn threw three touchdown passes, but in the end, [[Tom Brady]]'s greater experience prevailed as the [[2010 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] won 31\u201327. This game was nonetheless a turning point for the Packers, having been inspired by nearly beating the best team in the NFL when no one gave them a remote chance.\n\nWith an 8\u20136 record, the Packers needed to win their last two games to gain the #6 seed, the last seed, in the NFC playoffs. The Packers easily beat the New York Giants at home 45-17 and then hosted the rival Bears for the final game of the season. The Packers won the defensive struggle 10\u20133, sealing the Packers' playoff berth.\n\nIn the wild card round, the Packers had to travel to Philadelphia to play the hot [[2010 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]], led by Michael Vick. Rodgers threw for 3 touchdowns and rookie halfback [[James Starks]] had a 100+ yard running game.  [[Tramon Williams]] had an interception in the closing minutes sealing a Packer victory, 21\u201316.\n\nThe next game was against the Falcons in Atlanta.  Atlanta was the number-1 seed and was favored to beat Green Bay, but the Packers shocked the Atlanta fans by having a 28\u201314 lead at halftime, with Tramon Williams returning an interception for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Packers scored on the opening drive of the second half and the Falcons never recovered, as Green Bay rolled to a 48\u201321 win, sending the Packers to the NFC Championship game.\n\nThe NFC Championship game would be against the [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] in Chicago, in what was considered by almost everyone the biggest game ever in the Packers-Bears 90-year-old rivalry.  The game was only the second ever postseason meeting between the two storied rivals and the first playoff meeting between the teams since 1941, when they met in a one-game playoff for their division's championship, which the Bears won 33\u201314 in order to qualify for the [[1941 NFL Championship Game]], where they defeated the New York Giants.  The Packers scored on the opening drive on a touchdown run by Rodgers, and scored again in the second quarter on a run by Starks, giving the Packers a 14\u20130 lead at halftime. The defense was able to knock Bears starting quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] out of the game with a knee injury and soon after also knocked out back-up Todd Collins. In the fourth quarter, the Bears rallied with third-string quarterback [[Caleb Hanie]]. However, two key interceptions, one by defensive tackle [[B. J. Raji]] returned for a touchdown, and another by [[Sam Shields]] with less than a minute left, sealed the NFC championship for the Packers, who won 21\u201314.\n\nThe Packers played the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], who were seeking a record seventh Super Bowl title, in [[Super Bowl XLV]] at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in Arlington, Texas. The Packers struck first with two touchdowns near the end of the first quarter, one on a [[Jordy Nelson]] touchdown catch and the other on a [[Nick Collins]] interception return. Collins' touchdown marked the third consecutive playoff game in which the Packers returned an interception for a touchdown. The first half ended with the Packers leading 21\u201310, but they had lost both cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] and wide receiver [[Donald Driver]] to injury. The Steelers started to rally, but the Packers defense caused a key fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter and later stopped the Steelers on their final drive, winning their fourth Super Bowl and their record 13th overall NFL championship, 31\u201325. Aaron Rodgers was voted the game's MVP. With the win, the Packers joined the Steelers, 49ers and Cowboys as the only NFL teams to win at least four Super Bowls. They would eventually be joined by the New York Giants, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) following the 2011 season, and the New England Patriots, who won their fourth Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLIX]]) following the 2014 season.\n\n===2011 season: 15-1 regular season===\n\nDespite a lack of practices and training due to a lockout in the off-season, the Packers defeated New Orleans 42\u201334, hosting the first game of the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011]] season. After a touch-and-go battle with Carolina in Week 2, the Packers came out on top 30\u201323. Week 3 saw the rematch with Chicago, in which Green Bay again prevailed 27\u201317 to get off to a 3\u20130 start. Green Bay breezed to another easy win over the Broncos to remain unbeaten at 4\u20130. The Packers became the only undefeated team in Week 5 when Detroit lost to San Francisco and they beat a winless Rams squad. The Packers then went on to win their next four in a row to end the first half of the season with a record of 8\u20130.\n\nIn week 12, the Giants posed to be their greatest challenge thus far. The Giants tied the game 35-35 late in the 4th quarter.  But in the last final minute, the Packers persevered and won the game on a [[Mason Crosby]] field goal. They continued their winning streak into the second half of the season, bringing them to 12-0 and assuring the Packers an appearance in the NFL's 2011 postseason.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated Press|title=Rodgers engineers last-minute drive to overcome Giants, keep Packers unbeaten|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311204019}}</ref>\n\nTalk of an undefeated season finally ended in Week 15 when the Packers lost in Kansas City. Returning home, they beat an injury-depleted Bears team and while resting their starters in Week 17, Matt Flynn carried Green Bay to a wild shootout victory over Detroit. With a 15-1 finish and the #1 playoff seed, the Packers completed the 2011 regular season with the best record in franchise history.  They were the sixth, and are the most recent, team to win at least 15 games in a regular season, equaled by the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984 San Francisco 49ers]], [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings]], and [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2004 Pittsburgh Steelers]], and bettered by only the [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007 New England Patriots]], who recorded a perfect 16-0 regular season.  As they were the #1 seed, the Packers received a first-round bye and home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. After sitting out the wild-card round, Green Bay's post season came to an abrupt end in the divisional playoffs as the [[2011 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] (who went on to win [[Super Bowl XLVI]]) defeated them 37\u201320.\n\n===2012-2016: Playoff Struggles===\n\nIn 2012, the Packers went 11\u20135. They beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Wildcard round 24\u201310, and lost in the Divisional round 45\u201331 to the [[Super Bowl XLVII|eventual NFC champion]] San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn 2013, the Packers went 8-7-1, losing to the San Francisco 49ers 20\u201323 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn 2014, the Packers recorded their 700th victory against the Bears in week four.  The Packers are only the second team in NFL history to record 700 victories; the Bears were the first team to do it in 2010.  The team finished the regular season undefeated (8-0) in home games and 12-4 overall, and clinched the #2 seed in the NFC Playoffs.  After a first-round bye, they faced the Dallas Cowboys at home for the first time in the postseason since they won the [[1967 NFL Championship Game|\"Ice Bowl\"]].  There was a lot of hype in the week leading up to the game since during the regular season, the Packers had gone undefeated in home games while Dallas had gone undefeated in away games.  Green Bay defeated Dallas 26\u201321 to advance to the NFC Championship, where they faced the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.  After leading throughout most of regulation they lost 28\u201322 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle, who came up short in their bid for a second consecutive league title when they lost to the New England Patriots 28\u201324 in Super Bowl XLIX two weeks later.\n\nIn 2015, the Packers lost wide receiver [[Jordy Nelson]] to a torn ACL in the preseason. The Packers got off to a 6\u20130 start, but then went 1\u20134 to sit at 7-4 after Week 12. During Week 13 at Detroit, after trailing 20\u20130 in the second half, Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to tight end [[Richard Rodgers]] with no time left on the clock to [[Miracle in Motown|win the game 27-23]] after a facemask penalty was called on Detroit as time expired. The Packers clinched their seventh consecutive playoff berth with a Week 15 win at the [[Oakland Raiders]], but lost the division title to the [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]] in Week 17. With a 10\u20136 record, the Packers secured the fifth seed in the playoffs. They beat the fourth-seeded [[Washington Redskins]] on the road 35-18 and traveled to face the second-seeded [[Arizona Cardinals]]. A similar play to what happened in Week 13 at Detroit occurred in the last 5 seconds when Aaron Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass to wide receiver [[Jeff Janis]] to send the game to overtime. Unfortunately, the Packers' season ended when they lost to the Cardinals 26\u201320 in overtime.\n\nIn 2016, the Packers struggled throughout the first half of the season, sitting at 4-6 and on the verge of being eliminated from playoff contention. After their Week 10 loss at Washington, Aaron Rodgers said that the Packers could run the table and win their last six games. Despite widespread doubt of such a run, the Packers won their last six games of the season to finish the season with a 10\u20136 record and clinch the NFC North with a Week 17 win at Detroit. The Packers routed the fifth-seeded [[New York Giants]] 38\u201313 in the Wild Card round at Lambeau Field and upset the top-seeded [[Dallas Cowboys]] 34\u201331 at [[AT&T Stadium]] before falling to the second-seeded [[Atlanta Falcons]] 44\u201321 in the NFC Championship Game, which was the last NFL game ever played at the [[Georgia Dome]].\n\nIn 2017, the Packers started the season strong, going 4\u20131, until week 6, against the Minnesota Vikings. Early in the game, Aaron Rodgers was tackled hard by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, suffering a severe shoulder injury that would keep him out for the majority of the season. The Packers' offense struggled under backup quarterback Brett Hundley, losing 5 of their next 6 games, before getting back-to-back overtime victories over Tampa Bay and Cleveland. Aaron Rodgers returned for the next game, with the Packers at 7-6 and still in playoff contention. However, the Packers' attempt at a comeback against the Carolina Panthers fell short, with the Packers losing 31\u201324, eliminating them from the playoffs. Aaron Rodgers was benched for the last two games of the season, which were also Packers loses, causing the team to finish 7\u20139, their first losing season in 10 years. In the offseason, Ted Thompson, citing health issues, announced his resignation as general manager, and defensive coordinator Dom Capers was fired. Thompson was replaced with Brian Gutekunst, and Capers was replaced with Mike Pettine.\n\nThe 2018 season, which was the Packers' 100th season of existence, there was renewed hope in the Packers' rebounding, but the inconsistency with both the offense and defense caused the Packers to lose many close games, and also lose games against teams that, on paper, were supposedly worse than the Packers. The final straw came in a 20\u201317 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, which was the Cardinals' first-ever win at Lambeau Field, which also eliminated the Packers from the playoffs for the second season in a row. Head coach Mike McCarthy was promptly fired after the game, marking the first time ever the Packers had fired a coach during the regular season, and only the second time a head coach had left during the season (Gene Ronzani resigned in the middle of the 1953 season). Offensive coordinator Joe Philbin coached the Packers through the rest of the season, which finished with an even worse 6-9-1 mark.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Green Bay Packers}}\n{{NFL team history}}\n\n[[Category:Green Bay Packers]]\n[[Category:National Football League history by team|Green Bay Packers]]\n", "name_user": "Bagumba", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLombardi era (1959-1967):avoid redir", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Green_Bay_Packers"}
