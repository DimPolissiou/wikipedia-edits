This modern and novel rifle will allow all our Military Forces, Police and State Security Organizations to improve effectiveness in the fight against the actors that generate violence that affect the security of the country.\n\nThe * Galil C\u00f3rdoba * is another rifle that is based on the Colombian Galil AR '''https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evqi-Xq-gw8''' I remind you that Colombia is the only country or nation in the whole world that manufactures the Galil in all its variants AR, SAR, ARM, ACE, AND C\u00d3RDOBA.\n\nIWI together with FAMAE jointly produce some parts of the ACE rifle, the rest is imported from Colombia, (Ministry of National Defense) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngWSx9zE-HM Bone, * IWI and FAMAE * they are only assemblers of the Colombian ACE rifle\n\n==Design details==\n===Weight reduction===\n\nThe original [[IMI Galil|Galil]] was built with a machined solid steel billet action in order to increase the structural integrity and survivability of the weapon. Unfortunately this resulted in a weight of up to {{cvt|9.6|lb|kg}}, depending on its variant, which was one of the primary criticisms from the [[Israel Defense Forces]].\n\nThe ACE has a significantly reduced weight. IWI redesigned the action to integrate the steel with polymer, which is much lighter than the fully steel receiver of the original Galil.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\"/> While the upper receiver is machined steel and the receiver top features a MIL-STD-1913 [[Picatinny rail]], polymer has been introduced to the lower receiver of the weapon to reduce the gun's weight.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927&page=2|title=Galil Ace 5.56|date=29 May 2013|website=Small Arms Defense Journal|version=Volume 5|page=2|first=Paolo|last=Ortenzi}}</ref>\n\n===Accuracy===\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'': \u201cAlthough this rifle is clearly based on the AK design, it demonstrated a superior level of accuracy potential compared to several of its cousins. The best single group of [5 rounds at 100 yards] of 0.83\u2033 and five-group average of 0.98\u2033 was produced using the Federal Premium 123-[[Grain (unit)|gr.]] [{{cvt|123|gr|g|disp=out|lk=on}}] Power-Shok soft-point load\u201d (testing done using 7.62\u00d739mm 16-inch barrelled variant).<ref name=\"AmericanRifleman\" />\n\n===Gas tube===\nThe gas tube, unlike the AK-47 system, is mounted on the rifle via a dovetailed slide machined on the receiver upper-front block. This avoids any movement of the gas block influencing barrel vibration, which would degrade accuracy.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\" />\n\n===Long-stroke piston system===\nThe rifle uses the Galil's [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long-stroke piston]] system. The long-stroke system is found in the [[M1 Garand]], [[AK-47]] (upon which the Galil's internal mechanism design borrowed heavily) and more recently in the [[IWI Tavor]].\n\n===Barrel===\nThe barrel is chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged, with a 1:7\u2033 twist for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], 1:9.5\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d739mm]] and 1:12\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]].\n\n===Trigger===\nThe ACE adopts the [[IMI Galil#Galatz|Galil Sniper]] trigger instead of the original Galil trigger, in order to improve accuracy compared to the standard Galil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/08/24/galil-ace-rifle|title=Galil Ace Rifle|date=24 August 2010|first=Steve|last=Johnson|website=The Firearm Blog}}</ref> This is a two-stage trigger,<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\" /> which IWI have modelled on the two-stage trigger of the [[M1 Garand]].<ref name=\"Kokalis\">{{cite book|first=Peter G.|last=Kokalis|title=Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of ''Soldier of Fortune''|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Paladin Press|date=2001|page=253|isbn=978-1581601220}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'', the two-stage trigger is \u201cclean and smooth with a 4 lb. 13 oz.

The side forearm rails have central grooves to provide routing channels for electric wiring used by pressure switch activated accessories. The forearm comes with quick detachable polymer covering panels that can be mounted to protect the rails when a side or bottom rail has no accessories mounted to it.  The gas tube above the barrel also has a Picatinny rail mounted on top that is aligned with the rail mounted on the cover over the receiver.\n\n==Variants==\nThe ACE is available in three different calibres with multiple barrel lengths for each type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwi.net/ace/|title=ACE|website=Israel Weapon Industries}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model\n!Calibre\n!Barrel length\n!Length (extended)\n!Length (retracted)\n!Weight (unloaded)\n!Feed system\n!Muzzle velocity\n!Range\n!Rate of Fire<br>(rounds per minute)\n|-\n|ACE 21\n|[[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.00|kg|lb}}\n|35-round [[IMI Galil#Feeding|Galil magazine]]\n|{{cvt|710|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|300|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE-N 21\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.05|kg|lb}}\n|30-round [[STANAG magazine|NATO magazine]]\n|{{cvt|710|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|300|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 22\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|335|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|767|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.40|kg|lb}}\n|35-round Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|850|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE-N 22\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|335|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|767|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.45|kg|lb}}\n|30-round NATO magazine\n|{{cvt|850|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 23\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|463|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|976|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|896|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.60|kg|lb}}\n|35-round Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|915|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|500|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 31\n|[[7.62\u00d739mm]]\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.00|kg|lb}}\n|30-round [[AK-47#Magazines|AK magazine]]\n|{{cvt|600|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680-880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 32\n|7.62\u00d739mm\n|{{cvt|409|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|927|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.50|kg|lb}}\n|30-round AK magazine\n|{{cvt|680|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 52\n|[[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]\n|{{cvt|409|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|954|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|874|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.60|kg|lb}}\n|25-round [[IMI Galil#7.62mm variants|7.62mm Galil]] magazine\n|{{cvt|800|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 52L\n|7.62\u00d751mm NATO\n|{{cvt|457|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|992|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|912|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.71|kg|lb}}\n|25-round 7.62mm Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|830|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 53\n|7.62\u00d751mm NATO\n|{{cvt|511|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|1055|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|963|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.8|kg|lb}}\n|25-round 7.62mm Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|860|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|}\n\nAt some point,{{When|date=March 2017}} the ACE 52L was removed from the production line.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:ACE32.JPG|A right-side view of the ACE 21 (5.56\u00d745mm NATO), with a cheek weld on its buttstock.\nFile:Ace 32 close stock.jpg|A left-side view of the ACE 32 (7.62\u00d739mm).\nFile:Ace 52 side 2.jpg|A right-side view of the ACE 52 (7.62\u00d751mm NATO)\n</gallery>\n\n==Users==\n[[File:VII Cumbre Alianza del Pac\u00edfico (8754541903).jpg|thumb|The Colombian Police armed with the ACE 22.]]\n[[File:Galil ACE 32.jpg|thumb|The ACE 32 used in the Vietnam People's Army.]]\n\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

produced in three different calibers; [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], [[7.62\u00d739mm]] and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]].\n\n- 2006 Israel abandons the Galil and sells the patent to Colombia leaving it as the only manufacturer of the old Galil rifles worldwide\n- 2009 in the American continent Colombia announced the development of a new rifle based on the old Galil AR\n- 2010 Colombia presents to the world the new ACE or Galil ACE rifle, Review page 48 ( https://www.indumil.gov.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Info-gestion2010completo-1.pdf )\n\nI leave informative links from Indumil and the Colombian Ministry of Defense with OFFICIAL information on the development of the ACE rifle (The links are in Spanish, please translate with Google and correct spelling)\n\nThe * ACE * was designed and built by Colombia https://www.indumil.gov.co/noticia/galil-el-israelita-mas-colombiano/\n\n* Indumil: * The advances developed with Colombian technology and innovation were presented to the Israeli government, which praised the work carried out by Indumil, * authorized the transformation of the rifle * and became the largest buyer of Colombian parts Galil\n\n* Indumil: * El Galil is the * most developed patent * in weapons that the Colombian military industry has had (El Galil is a brand and since every brand is sold, since Colombia acquired it it has been improving it)\n\nhttps://www.indumil.gov.co/noticia/nuevo-fusil-galil-ace/\n\n* indumil: * For the Military Industry, it is a source of pride to present the new Colombian-produced Galil ACE rifle, an objective that is achieved through synergy with the company that designed and developed the weapon * (Galil AR) * and after development own * (Galil ACE) * based on a technology transfer process. This modern and novel rifle will allow all our Military Forces, Police and State Security Organizations to improve effectiveness in the fight against the actors that generate violence that affect the security of the country.\n\nThe * Galil C\u00f3rdoba * is another rifle that is based on the Colombian Galil AR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evqi-Xq-gw8 I remind you that Colombia is the only country or nation in the whole world that manufactures the Galil in all its variants AR, SAR, ARM, ACE, AND C\u00d3RDOBA.\n\nIWI together with FAMAE jointly produce some parts of the ACE rifle, the rest is imported from Colombia, (Ministry of National Defense) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngWSx9zE-HM Bone, * IWI and FAMAE * they are only assemblers of the Colombian ACE rifle\n\n==Design details==\n===Weight reduction===\n\nThe original [[IMI Galil|Galil]] was built with a machined solid steel billet action in order to increase the structural integrity and survivability of the weapon. Unfortunately this resulted in a weight of up to {{cvt|9.6|lb|kg}}, depending on its variant, which was one of the primary criticisms from the [[Israel Defense Forces]].\n\nThe ACE has a significantly reduced weight. IWI redesigned the action to integrate the steel with polymer, which is much lighter than the fully steel receiver of the original Galil.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\"/> While the upper receiver is machined steel and the receiver top features a MIL-STD-1913 [[Picatinny rail]], polymer has been introduced to the lower receiver of the weapon to reduce the gun's weight.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927&page=2|title=Galil Ace 5.56|date=29 May 2013|website=Small Arms Defense Journal|version=Volume 5|page=2|first=Paolo|last=Ortenzi}}</ref>\n\n===Accuracy===\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'': \u201cAlthough this rifle is clearly based on the AK design, it demonstrated a superior level of accuracy potential compared to several of its cousins. The best single group of [5 rounds at 100 yards] of 0.83\u2033 and five-group average of 0.98\u2033 was produced using the Federal Premium 123-[[Grain (unit)|gr.]] [{{cvt|123|gr|g|disp=out|lk=on}}] Power-Shok soft-point load\u201d (testing done using 7.62\u00d739mm 16-inch barrelled variant).<ref name=\"AmericanRifleman\" />\n\n===Gas tube===\nThe gas tube, unlike the AK-47 system, is mounted on the rifle via a dovetailed slide machined on the receiver upper-front block. This avoids any movement of the gas block influencing barrel vibration, which would degrade accuracy.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\" />\n\n===Long-stroke piston system===\nThe rifle uses the Galil's [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long-stroke piston]] system. The long-stroke system is found in the [[M1 Garand]], [[AK-47]] (upon which the Galil's internal mechanism design borrowed heavily) and more recently in the [[IWI Tavor]].\n\n===Barrel===\nThe barrel is chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged, with a 1:7\u2033 twist for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], 1:9.5\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d739mm]] and 1:12\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]].\n\n===Trigger===\nThe ACE adopts the [[IMI Galil#Galatz|Galil Sniper]] trigger instead of the original Galil trigger, in order to improve accuracy compared to the standard Galil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/08/24/galil-ace-rifle|title=Galil Ace Rifle|date=24 August 2010|first=Steve|last=Johnson|website=The Firearm Blog}}</ref> This is a two-stage trigger,<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\" /> which IWI have modelled on the two-stage trigger of the [[M1 Garand]].<ref name=\"Kokalis\">{{cite book|first=Peter G.|last=Kokalis|title=Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of ''Soldier of Fortune''|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Paladin Press|date=2001|page=253|isbn=978-1581601220}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'', the two-stage trigger is \u201cclean and smooth with a 4 lb. 13 oz.

Gil|last=Horman|date=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Last round bolt catch===\nAnother addition by IWI to the original Galil is the last round bolt catch (for variants of the ACE in 5.56\u00d745mm NATO only). The bolt hold-open feature is a common request of military customers, to reduce reloading times during combat.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II|last=Tilstra|first=Russell C.|date=21 March 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0786473212|pages=98}}</ref>\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe ACE has a fully adjustable [[iron sights]] with tritium front post and two dot tritium rear aperture. It also features a [[Picatinny rail]] for mounting various optical sight.\n\n===Stock===\nThe standard buttstock found on the ACE is a six-position telescopic stock that can be fitted with an optional cheek-piece to improve the sighting of the weapon when using an [[Sight (device)#Optical sights|optical sight]]. An optional right folding version of the standard buttstock is also available.<ref name=\"indumil.gov.co\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indumil.gov.co/noticia/galil-el-israelita-mas-colombiano/|title=Galil, el Israelita m\u00e1s Colombiano \u2013 Indumil|website=www.indumil.gov.co|language=es|access-date=2018-11-03}}</ref>\n\nThe forearm consists of MIL-STD-1913 [[Picatinny rail]]s on the bottom and both sides for mounting accessories such as aiming optics. The side forearm rails have central grooves to provide routing channels for electric wiring used by pressure switch activated accessories. The forearm comes with quick detachable polymer covering panels that can be mounted to protect the rails when a side or bottom rail has no accessories mounted to it.  The gas tube above the barrel also has a Picatinny rail mounted on top that is aligned with the rail mounted on the cover over the receiver.\n\n==Variants==\nThe ACE is available in three different calibres with multiple barrel lengths for each type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwi.net/ace/|title=ACE|website=Israel Weapon Industries}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model\n!Calibre\n!Barrel length\n!Length (extended)\n!Length (retracted)\n!Weight (unloaded)\n!Feed system\n!Muzzle velocity\n!Range\n!Rate of Fire<br>(rounds per minute)\n|-\n|ACE 21\n|[[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.00|kg|lb}}\n|35-round [[IMI Galil#Feeding|Galil magazine]]\n|{{cvt|710|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|300|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE-N 21\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.05|kg|lb}}\n|30-round [[STANAG magazine|NATO magazine]]\n|{{cvt|710|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|300|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 22\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|335|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|767|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.40|kg|lb}}\n|35-round Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|850|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE-N 22\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|335|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|767|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.45|kg|lb}}\n|30-round NATO magazine\n|{{cvt|850|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 23\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|463|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|976|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|896|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.60|kg|lb}}\n|35-round Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|915|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|500|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 31\n|[[7.62\u00d739mm]]\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.00|kg|lb}}\n|30-round [[AK-47#Magazines|AK magazine]]\n|{{cvt|600|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680-880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 32\n|7.62\u00d739mm\n|{{cvt|409|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|927|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.50|kg|lb}}\n|30-round AK magazine\n|{{cvt|680|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 52\n|[[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]\n|{{cvt|409|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|954|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|874|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.60|kg|lb}}\n|25-round [[IMI Galil#7.62mm variants|7.62mm Galil]] magazine\n|{{cvt|800|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 52L\n|7.62\u00d751mm NATO\n|{{cvt|457|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|992|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|912|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.71|kg|lb}}\n|25-round 7.62mm Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|830|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 53\n|7.62\u00d751mm NATO\n|{{cvt|511|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|1055|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|963|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.8|kg|lb}}\n|25-round 7.62mm Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|860|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|}\n\nAt some point,{{When|date=March 2017}} the ACE 52L was removed from the production line.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:ACE32.JPG|A right-side view of the ACE 21 (5.56\u00d745mm NATO), with a cheek weld on its buttstock.\nFile:Ace 32 close stock.jpg|A left-side view of the ACE 32 (7.62\u00d739mm).\nFile:Ace 52 side 2.jpg|A right-side view of the ACE 52 (7.62\u00d751mm NATO)\n</gallery>\n\n==Users==\n[[File:VII Cumbre Alianza del Pac\u00edfico (8754541903).jpg|thumb|The Colombian Police armed with the ACE 22.]]\n[[File:Galil ACE 32.jpg|thumb|The ACE 32 used in the Vietnam People's Army.]]\n\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
