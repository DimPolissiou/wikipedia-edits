The G suit was a garment, produced by the [[David Clark Company]], which has air bladders situated at the calves, thighs, and abdomen of the wearer. The bladders inflate as the G-force acting on the aircraft increase, constricting the wearer's arteries, hence increasing blood pressure and blood flow to the brain.\n\nThe G-suit was a superior solution to another alternative (a water-filled suit) being tested at the time, which was considered impractically heavy and cumbersome. The water-filled, pulsatile pressure suits were developed to effect venous return.  However, Wood and colleagues' detailed physiologic measurements demonstrated that what was required was augmentation of arterial pressure.\n\nWood himself regularly tested the flight suits, taking many turns in a human centrifuge and plane dubbed the \"G-wiz.\" He calculated that over his several hundred rides, he had lost consciousness for an aggregate of at least fifteen minutes (without any observed lasting damage). Wood was awarded a Presidential Certificate of Merit by Harry Truman in 1947.\n\nThe G-suit was adopted in the 1940s. The current models are based on the pattern Wood and his colleagues designed. Following World War II, Wood was recruited to participate in what was known as \"[[Operation Paperclip]]\"<ref name=Hansel>{{cite web|url=http://www.postbulletin.com/inside-inventor-had-a-life-outside-of-science/article_533fb0fc-43f2-5699-af8e-4c5280a741a6.html|title=INSIDE Inventor had a life outside of science|work=[[Post-Bulletin]]|date=27 October 2008|first=Jeff|last=Hansel}}</ref> The goal was to keep the top German scientists away from Russia and working for the United States.\n\nIn 1962, Wood was the tenth scientist to be named \"Career Investigator,\" of the American Heart Association.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Burchell | first1 = HB | last2 = Wood | first2 = Earl H. | date = May 1987 | title = outstanding twentieth century investigator of the heart and circulation | url = | journal = Clin Cardiol | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 372\u20134 | pmid = 3297443 | doi=10.1002/clc.4960100518}}</ref> These funds allowed Wood considerable flexibility in regards to the directions of his research.\n\n=== Other work ===\nAfter his work on the G-Suit, Wood worked on techniques for measuring cardiac blood flow.

The G suit was a garment, produced by the [[David Clark Company]], which has air bladders situated at the calves, thighs, and abdomen of the wearer. The bladders inflate as the G-force acting on the aircraft increase, constricting the wearer's arteries, hence increasing blood pressure and blood flow to the brain.\n\nThe G-suit was a superior solution to another alternative (a water-filled suit) being tested at the time, which was considered impractically heavy and cumbersome. The water-filled, pulsatile pressure suits were developed to effect venous return.  However, Wood and colleagues' detailed physiologic measurements demonstrated that what was required was augmentation of arterial pressure.\n\nWood himself regularly tested the flight suits, taking many turns in a human centrifuge and plane dubbed the \"G-wiz.\" He calculated that over his several hundred rides, he had lost consciousness for an aggregate of at least fifteen minutes (without any observed lasting damage). Wood was awarded a Presidential Certificate of Merit by Harry Truman in 1947.\n\nThe G-suit was adopted in the 1940s. The current models are based on the pattern Wood and his colleagues designed.

One day she is dumped in a waste materials facility and she falls sick. Doctor Vijayan (K. V. Srinivasan), who comes to treat her, sympathises and admits her in a private school-cum-hostel for orphans. Malathi grows up into a young lady ([[Kanchana (actress)|Kanchana]]) and becomes a teacher in the same school.\n\nBaskar ([[Gemini Ganesan]]), a rich estate owner, lives in Shanthi Nilayam with his older brother Sekar's children (four daughters and a son) and is finding it difficult to bring them up as they are very naughty and the hired governess runs away every time. His cousin Ramu ([[Nagesh]]) and his mother ([[Pandari Bai]]) live in the estate too. Baskar conveys his need to Dr. Vijayan who convinces Malathi to accept the governess job. Initially, the children do not accept Malathi, but her understanding and matured nature soon wins them over. Baskar appreciates her work.\n\nStrange things happen in the house: Pappamma, the servant maid laughs and walks at midnight with a candle, Balu ([[K. Balaji]]) visits Baskar regularly for money. Malathi suspects something wrong in the house. She comes to know that one of the children, Geetha ([[Rama Prabha]]), an innocent loves Ramu. One night Baskar's coat catches fire and Malathi douses it. She demands to know why Baskar looks like he has lost something, but he does not reply. Balu comes again and Baskar gives him money and tells him that he will not give him any more.\n\nBaskar's family friend, Parvatham ([[M. S. Sundari Bai]]) arrives with her husband and daughter Sheela ([[Vijayalalitha]]). Parvatham suggests the marriage of Baskar and Sheela and Malathi is upset hearing this. Malathi's aunt, with her daughters Saradha and Sumathi, arrives there after having fallen in their lives. Ramu's mother accepts them and they stay with Malathi. Sheela and her mother treat Malathi and her relatives badly. They spread rumours about Malathi, and Baskar shouts at Malathi to behave properly like an educated person. Malathi feels that even Baskar is treating her like a servant and decides to leave the house. However, Ramu stops her and states the children's needs and she stays back. Baskar understands Malathi's commitment to the family and expresses his love for her. Sheela overhears this and shouts at Malathi for snatching away Baskar. Baskar asks Sheela and her family to leave. The children are happy about Malathi and Baskar uniting. Baskar schedules their wedding for the following Friday. One day, Malathi sees Balu with bloodstains and demands an explanation from Baskar who promises to reveal everything soon.\n\nDuring the marriage proceeding, Balu arrives and states that Baskar has already married his sister. Baskar accepts and reveals that he indeed married Janaki, a mad woman and explains the circumstances of the marriage. Baskar's father ([[V. S. Raghavan]]) in an altercation, hit Singaram (Senthamarai), Balu's father, leading to his death. Balu blackmails Baskar's father to marry his sister to Bhaskar and give a part of the wealth to her. Baskar's father refuses, but Baskar, to save the family's prestige, agrees and marries Janaki, but finds her totally mad. He gives her the best medical treatment, but there is no improvement in Janaki. Pappamma takes care of her. Baskar's brother Sekar was killed in a fire lit by Janaki. Ramu's mother confirms the facts and  Malathi is shocked and leaves home. The children cry for her to stay and Kavitha, one of them, follows her. Kavitha falls down unconscious and Malathi stops and returns home along with Dr. Vijayan, who arrives there.\n\nMeanwhile, Balu demands Baskar to transfer the wealth belonging to Janaki to him and threatens to kill him otherwise. Baskar takes him on and beats him. At the same time, Janaki comes out of her room and puts the house on fire. Balu. Janaki and Pappamma die in the fire. Malathi, Ramu and Dr. Vijayan arrive and save everybody. Baskar and Malathi marry.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}}\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Gemini Ganesan]] as Bhaskar\n*[[Kanchana (actress)|Kanchana]] as Malathi\n*[[Vijayalalitha]] as Sheela\n*[[Nagesh]] as Ramu\n*[[K.

S. Vasan]] saw the Kannada film and bought the remake rights for it. He assigned Chitralaya Gopu to write the screenplay and dialogues for the Tamil version. Although Vasan liked the screenplay, he felt that the film would not cater to the rural audience. Gopu, in turn, felt that Vasan's doubts would be overcome with Nagesh's comic potential. Vasan's words however proved to be true as the film ran well only in cities and not so much in smaller towns.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}}\n\nGopu's recommendation of Kanchana for the lead role was agreed to by the film's director Mani.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}} The film was entirely shot at Ooty and art director Mohana Kumari was in charge of erecting the special sets required to shoot the film's scenes.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}} The flying helium balloon in the song \"Bhoomiyil Iruppadhu\" was one of the highlights.

One day she is dumped in a waste materials facility and she falls sick. Doctor Vijayan (K. V. Srinivasan), who comes to treat her, sympathises and admits her in a private school-cum-hostel for orphans. Malathi grows up into a young lady ([[Kanchana (actress)|Kanchana]]) and becomes a teacher in the same school.\n\nBaskar ([[Gemini Ganesan]]), a rich estate owner, lives in Shanthi Nilayam with his older brother Sekar's children (four daughters and a son) and is finding it difficult to bring them up as they are very naughty and the hired governess runs away every time. His cousin Ramu ([[Nagesh]]) and his mother ([[Pandari Bai]]) live in the estate too. Baskar conveys his need to Dr. Vijayan who convinces Malathi to accept the governess job. Initially, the children do not accept Malathi, but her understanding and matured nature soon wins them over. Baskar appreciates her work.\n\nStrange things happen in the house: Pappamma, the servant maid laughs and walks at midnight with a candle, Balu ([[K. Balaji]]) visits Baskar regularly for money. Malathi suspects something wrong in the house. She comes to know that one of the children, Geetha ([[Rama Prabha]]), an innocent loves Ramu. One night Baskar's coat catches fire and Malathi douses it. She demands to know why Baskar looks like he has lost something, but he does not reply. Balu comes again and Baskar gives him money and tells him that he will not give him any more.\n\nBaskar's family friend, Parvatham ([[M. S. Sundari Bai]]) arrives with her husband and daughter Sheela ([[Vijayalalitha]]). Parvatham suggests the marriage of Baskar and Sheela and Malathi is upset hearing this. Malathi's aunt, with her daughters Saradha and Sumathi, arrives there after having fallen in their lives. Ramu's mother accepts them and they stay with Malathi. Sheela and her mother treat Malathi and her relatives badly. They spread rumours about Malathi, and Baskar shouts at Malathi to behave properly like an educated person. Malathi feels that even Baskar is treating her like a servant and decides to leave the house. However, Ramu stops her and states the children's needs and she stays back. Baskar understands Malathi's commitment to the family and expresses his love for her. Sheela overhears this and shouts at Malathi for snatching away Baskar. Baskar asks Sheela and her family to leave. The children are happy about Malathi and Baskar uniting. Baskar schedules their wedding for the following Friday. One day, Malathi sees Balu with bloodstains and demands an explanation from Baskar who promises to reveal everything soon.\n\nDuring the marriage proceeding, Balu arrives and states that Baskar has already married his sister. Baskar accepts and reveals that he indeed married Janaki, a mad woman and explains the circumstances of the marriage. Baskar's father ([[V. S. Raghavan]]) in an altercation, hit Singaram (Senthamarai), Balu's father, leading to his death. Balu blackmails Baskar's father to marry his sister to Bhaskar and give a part of the wealth to her. Baskar's father refuses, but Baskar, to save the family's prestige, agrees and marries Janaki, but finds her totally mad. He gives her the best medical treatment, but there is no improvement in Janaki. Pappamma takes care of her. Baskar's brother Sekar was killed in a fire lit by Janaki. Ramu's mother confirms the facts and  Malathi is shocked and leaves home. The children cry for her to stay and Kavitha, one of them, follows her. Kavitha falls down unconscious and Malathi stops and returns home along with Dr. Vijayan, who arrives there.\n\nMeanwhile, Balu demands Baskar to transfer the wealth belonging to Janaki to him and threatens to kill him otherwise. Baskar takes him on and beats him. At the same time, Janaki comes out of her room and puts the house on fire. Balu. Janaki and Pappamma die in the fire. Malathi, Ramu and Dr. Vijayan arrive and save everybody. Baskar and Malathi marry.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}}\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Gemini Ganesan]] as Bhaskar\n*[[Kanchana (actress)|Kanchana]] as Malathi\n*[[Vijayalalitha]] as Sheela\n*[[Nagesh]] as Ramu\n*[[K.

S. Vasan]] saw the Kannada film and bought the remake rights for it. He assigned Chitralaya Gopu to write the screenplay and dialogues for the Tamil version. Although Vasan liked the screenplay, he felt that the film would not cater to the rural audience. Gopu, in turn, felt that Vasan's doubts would be overcome with Nagesh's comic potential. Vasan's words however proved to be true as the film ran well only in cities and not so much in smaller towns.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}}\n\nGopu's recommendation of Kanchana for the lead role was agreed to by the film's director Mani.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}} The film was entirely shot at Ooty and art director Mohana Kumari was in charge of erecting the special sets required to shoot the film's scenes.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=209}} The flying helium balloon in the song \"Bhoomiyil Iruppadhu\" was one of the highlights.

Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\n\n[[Phenotypic trait|Trait]] inheritance and [[Molecular genetics|molecular]] inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the organism (e.g. [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]]), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including [[molecular genetics]], [[epigenetics]] and [[population genetics]]. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life ([[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[eukarya]]).\n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and [[behavioural genetics|behavior]], often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]]. The [[intracellular]] or [[extracellular]] environment of a living cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the [[arid climate]] only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''genetics'' stems from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genetikos}}'' meaning \"genitive\"/\"generative\", which in turn derives from {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genesis}}'' meaning \"origin\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321880&redirect=true |title=Genetikos (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4-\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&redirect=true |archive-date=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321873&redirect=true |title=Genesis (\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&redirect=true |archive-date=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&searchmode=none |title=Genetic |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823020616/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&searchmode=none |archive-date=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of genetics}}\n\nThe observation that living things inherit [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through [[selective breeding]].<ref name=\"Publishing2009\">{{cite book |title=Science: The Definitive Visual Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFiJFuzRVFQC&pg=PA362 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7566-6490-9 |page=362}}</ref> The modern science of genetics, seeking to understand this process, began with the work of the [[Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Gregor Mendel]] in the mid-19th century.<ref name=Weiling>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiling F | title = Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822\u20131884 | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201325; discussion 26 | date = July 1991 | pmid = 1887835 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.1320400103 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to Mendel, [[Imre Festetics]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] noble, who lived in K\u0151szeg before Mendel, was the first who used the word \"genetics.\" He described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work ''The genetic law of the Nature'' (Die genetische Ges\u00e4tze der Natur, 1819).

This process, called [[mitosis]], is the simplest form of reproduction and is the basis for [[asexual reproduction]]. Asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms, producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent. Offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called [[Cloning|clones]].\n\n[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] organisms often use [[sexual reproduction]] to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents. The process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome ([[haploid]]) and double copies ([[diploid]]).<ref name=griffiths2000sect484/> Haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes. Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing, without replicating their DNA, to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes. Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan, with the haploid form reduced to single cell [[gamete]]s such as [[sperm]] or [[Ovum|eggs]].\n\nAlthough they do not use the haploid/diploid method of sexual reproduction, [[bacteria]] have many methods of acquiring new genetic information.

Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as [[enzyme]]s by facilitating [[chemical reaction]]s within the bound molecules (without changing the structure of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein [[hemoglobin]] bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport, and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood.\n\nA [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide difference]] within DNA can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. Because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences, some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules. For example, [[sickle-cell anemia]] is a human [[Genetic disorder|genetic disease]] that results from a single base difference within the [[coding region]] for the \u03b2-globin section of hemoglobin, causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin's physical properties.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Does Sickle Cell Cause Disease? |url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |date=11 April 2002 |access-date=23 July 2007 |publisher=Brigham and Women's Hospital: Information Center for Sickle Cell and Thalassemic Disorders |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923165921/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |archive-date=23 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Sickle-cell versions of hemoglobin stick to themselves, stacking to form fibers that distort the shape of [[red blood cell]]s carrying the protein.

In some cases, these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions (e.g. [[ribosomal RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]]).

The phrase \"[[nature and nurture]]\"  refers to this complementary relationship. The phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genes and the environment. An interesting example is the coat coloration of the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese cat]]. In this case, the body temperature of the cat plays the role of the environment. The cat's genes code for dark hair, thus the hair-producing cells in the cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair. But these dark hair-producing proteins are sensitive to temperature (i.e. have a mutation causing temperature-sensitivity) and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] in higher-temperature environments, failing to produce dark-hair pigment in areas where the cat has a higher body temperature. In a low-temperature environment, however, the protein's structure is stable and produces dark-hair pigment normally. The protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder{{emdash}}such as its legs, ears, tail and face{{emdash}}so the cat has dark hair at its extremities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Imes DL, Geary LA, Grahn RA, Lyons LA | title = Albinism in the domestic cat (Felis catus) is associated with a tyrosinase (TYR) mutation | journal = Animal Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 175\u20138 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16573534 | pmc = 1464423 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2052.2005.01409.x }}</ref>\n\nEnvironment plays a major role in effects of the human genetic disease [[phenylketonuria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/phenylketonuria.html |title=MedlinePlus: Phenylketonuria |access-date=15 March 2008 |publisher=NIH: National Library of Medicine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725183720/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/phenylketonuria.html |archive-date=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts the ability of the body to break down the amino acid [[phenylalanine]], causing a toxic build-up of an intermediate molecule that, in turn, causes severe symptoms of progressive intellectual disability and seizures.

[[Mutation]]s occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide. Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring, they can affect the behavior of cells, sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently. There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger [[Apoptosis|cell death]], but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages. An internal process of [[natural selection]] occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth, creating a cancerous [[Tumour heterogeneity|tumor]] that grows and invades various tissues of the body.\n\nNormally, a cell divides only in response to signals called [[growth factor]]s and [[Contact inhibition|stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells]] and in response to growth-inhibitory signals. It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies, staying within the [[epithelium]] where it is unable to migrate to other organs. To become a cancer cell, a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes (three to seven). A cancer cell can divide without growth factor and ignores inhibitory signals. Also, it is immortal and can grow indefinitely, even after it makes contact with neighboring cells. It may escape from the epithelium and ultimately from the [[primary tumor]]. Then, the escaped cell can cross the endothelium of a blood vessel and get transported by the bloodstream to colonize a new organ, forming deadly [[metastasis]]. Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers, the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny ([[somatic mutation]]s). The most frequent mutations are a loss of function of [[p53 protein]], a [[tumor suppressor]], or in the p53 pathway, and gain of function mutations in the [[Ras proteins]], or in other [[oncogene]]s.\n\n===Research methods===\n[[File:Ecoli colonies.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' produced by [[Cloning#Unicellular organisms|cellular cloning]].

Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\n\n[[Phenotypic trait|Trait]] inheritance and [[Molecular genetics|molecular]] inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the organism (e.g. [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]]), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including [[molecular genetics]], [[epigenetics]] and [[population genetics]]. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life ([[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[eukarya]]).\n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and [[behavioural genetics|behavior]], often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]]. The [[intracellular]] or [[extracellular]] environment of a living cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the [[arid climate]] only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''genetics'' stems from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genetikos}}'' meaning \"genitive\"/\"generative\", which in turn derives from {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|genesis}}'' meaning \"origin\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321880&redirect=true |title=Genetikos (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4-\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&redirect=true |archive-date=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2321873&redirect=true |title=Genesis (\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100615000649/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#1980&redirect=true |archive-date=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&searchmode=none |title=Genetic |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823020616/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Genetic&searchmode=none |archive-date=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of genetics}}\n\nThe observation that living things inherit [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through [[selective breeding]].<ref name=\"Publishing2009\">{{cite book |title=Science: The Definitive Visual Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFiJFuzRVFQC&pg=PA362 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7566-6490-9 |page=362}}</ref> The modern science of genetics, seeking to understand this process, began with the work of the [[Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Gregor Mendel]] in the mid-19th century.<ref name=Weiling>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiling F | title = Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822-1884 | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201325; discussion 26 | date = July 1991 | pmid = 1887835 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.1320400103 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to Mendel, [[Imre Festetics]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] noble, who lived in K\u0151szeg before Mendel, was the first who used the word \"genetics.\" He described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work ''The genetic law of the Nature'' (Die genetische Ges\u00e4tze der Natur, 1819).

This means that the inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers. This phenomenon, known as \"[[Mendelian inheritance#Law of Independent Assortment (The \"Second Law\")|Mendel's second law]]\" or the \"law of independent assortment,\" means that the alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations. (Some genes do not assort independently, demonstrating [[genetic linkage]], a topic discussed later in this article.)\n\nOften different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait. In the [[Omphalodes verna|Blue-eyed Mary]] (''Omphalodes verna''), for example, there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers: blue or magenta. Another gene, however, controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white. When a plant has two copies of this white allele, its flowers are white\u2014regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles.

Offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called [[Cloning|clones]].\n\n[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] organisms often use [[sexual reproduction]] to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents. The process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome ([[haploid]]) and double copies ([[diploid]]).<ref name=griffiths2000sect484/> Haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes. Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing, without replicating their DNA, to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes. Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan, with the haploid form reduced to single cell [[gamete]]s such as [[sperm]] or [[Ovum|eggs]].\n\nAlthough they do not use the haploid/diploid method of sexual reproduction, [[bacteria]] have many methods of acquiring new genetic information. Some bacteria can undergo [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], transferring a small circular piece of DNA to another bacterium.<!--\n     --><ref name=\"griffiths2000sect1304\">{{cite book |editor-first=Anthony J.F. |editor-last=Griffiths |editor2-first=Jeffrey H. |editor2-last=Miller |editor3-first=David T. |editor3-last=Suzuki |editor4-first=Richard C. |editor4-last=Lewontin |editor5-last=Gelbart | name-list-format = vanc  |title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7167-3520-5 |edition=7th |publisher=W.H.

Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as [[enzyme]]s by facilitating [[chemical reaction]]s within the bound molecules (without changing the structure of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein [[hemoglobin]] bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport, and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood.\n\nA [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide difference]] within DNA can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. Because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences, some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules. For example, [[sickle-cell anemia]] is a human [[Genetic disorder|genetic disease]] that results from a single base difference within the [[coding region]] for the \u03b2-globin section of hemoglobin, causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin's physical properties.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Does Sickle Cell Cause Disease? |url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |date=11 April 2002 |access-date=23 July 2007 |publisher=Brigham and Women's Hospital: Information Center for Sickle Cell and Thalassemic Disorders |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923165921/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/scd_background.html |archive-date=23 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Sickle-cell versions of hemoglobin stick to themselves, stacking to form fibers that distort the shape of [[red blood cell]]s carrying the protein.

In some cases, these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions (e.g. [[ribosomal RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]]).

An interesting example is the coat coloration of the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese cat]]. In this case, the body temperature of the cat plays the role of the environment. The cat's genes code for dark hair, thus the hair-producing cells in the cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair. But these dark hair-producing proteins are sensitive to temperature (i.e. have a mutation causing temperature-sensitivity) and [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] in higher-temperature environments, failing to produce dark-hair pigment in areas where the cat has a higher body temperature. In a low-temperature environment, however, the protein's structure is stable and produces dark-hair pigment normally. The protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder{{emdash}}such as its legs, ears, tail and face{{emdash}}so the cat has dark hair at its extremities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Imes DL, Geary LA, Grahn RA, Lyons LA | title = Albinism in the domestic cat (Felis catus) is associated with a tyrosinase (TYR) mutation | journal = Animal Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 175\u20138 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16573534 | pmc = 1464423 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2052.2005.01409.x }}</ref>\n\nEnvironment plays a major role in effects of the human genetic disease [[phenylketonuria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/phenylketonuria.html |title=MedlinePlus: Phenylketonuria |access-date=15 March 2008 |publisher=NIH: National Library of Medicine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725183720/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/phenylketonuria.html |archive-date=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts the ability of the body to break down the amino acid [[phenylalanine]], causing a toxic build-up of an intermediate molecule that, in turn, causes severe symptoms of progressive intellectual disability and seizures.

[[Mutation]]s occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide. Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring, they can affect the behavior of cells, sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently. There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger [[Apoptosis|cell death]], but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages. An internal process of [[natural selection]] occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth, creating a cancerous [[Tumour heterogeneity|tumor]] that grows and invades various tissues of the body.\n\nNormally, a cell divides only in response to signals called [[growth factor]]s and [[Contact inhibition|stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells]] and in response to growth-inhibitory signals. It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies, staying within the [[epithelium]] where it is unable to migrate to other organs. To become a cancer cell, a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes (three to seven). A cancer cell can divide without growth factor and ignores inhibitory signals. Also, it is immortal and can grow indefinitely, even after it makes contact with neighboring cells. It may escape from the epithelium and ultimately from the [[primary tumor]]. Then, the escaped cell can cross the endothelium of a blood vessel and get transported by the bloodstream to colonize a new organ, forming deadly [[metastasis]]. Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers, the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny ([[somatic mutation]]s). The most frequent mutations are a loss of function of [[p53 protein]], a [[tumor suppressor]], or in the p53 pathway, and gain of function mutations in the [[Ras proteins]], or in other [[oncogene]]s.\n\n===Research methods===\n[[File:Ecoli colonies.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' produced by [[Cloning#Unicellular organisms|cellular cloning]].

The work, in [[E&nbsp;minor]], takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing {{lang|it|[[colla parte]]}}. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre. According to [[Philipp Spitta]], [[Johann Michael Bach]]'s motet {{ill|Halt, was du hast|choralwiki|Halt, was du hast (Johann Michael Bach)|lt=''Halt, was du hast''}}, [[ABA&nbsp;I,&nbsp;10]], which contains a setting of the \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" chorale, may have been on Johann Sebastian's mind when he composed his motet named after the chorale, in E&nbsp;minor like his ancestor's.{{sfn|Spitta|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastianb02spituoft#page/601 601]}}\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} In eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir, while the large majority of his church music is to be performed with a (single) SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\n===Time of origin===\nMost of Bach's motets are difficult to date, and {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is no exception.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Wolf (score)|2002|p=V}} Spitta assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}} In 1912, Bernhard Friedrich Richter wrote that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was likely written in Bach's first year as {{lang|de|[[Thomaskantor]]}} in Leipzig, for the funeral of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, on 18 July 1723, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the Epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=IV}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to analyse the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, which led Smend to suggest that the work was composed in the 1720s.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} Looking at the four-part settings of the chorale movements 1, 7 and 11, which seem unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Bach's Weimar period, or even earlier, Melamed thought that the motet was likely in part compiled from music Bach had composed before his Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\n[[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} According to [[Richard D.&nbsp;P. Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. Only the alto, the middle voice in the motet's SSATB setting, sings in all movements. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing {{lang|it|colla parte}} in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements, both five-part, mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements, both four-part. The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices. The central movement (Rom.&nbsp;8:9) is a five-part fugue.{{sfn|Posner|2020}}{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"700px\"\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''1'''<br />chorale<br />[[SATB]]<br />{{nowrap|(same as 11)}}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:1<br />SSATB<br />{{nowrap|(similar to 10)}}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" |\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''2'''<br />chorale<br /> SSATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:2<br />SSA\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''3'''<br />free<br />chorale<br />SSATB\n|}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:9<br />SSATB<br />fugue\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" |\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''4'''<br />chorale<br />SATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:10<br />ATB\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''5'''<br />chorale fantasia<br /> SSAT\n|}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | Epistle<br />Rom.&nbsp;8:11<br />SSATB<br>{{nowrap|(similar to 2)}}\n| width=\"12%\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\" | '''6'''<br />chorale<br />SATB<br />(same as 1)\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n==== 1 ====\nThe motet begins with a four-part setting of the first stanza of the hymn{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=2}} \"{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}}\" (Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} This and the other movements related to the hymn are in E minor.

All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\nPerformers of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small vocal ensemble or a larger choir, a continuo group, and instruments playing {{lang|it|colla parte}}.{{sfn|Wolf (score)|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}}\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, there is no extant [[autograph (music)|autograph]] of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}. The motet's SATB chorales were copied in several 18th-century manuscripts collecting [[List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach|chorale harmonisations by Bach]].{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227/1 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227/7 at Bach Digital}} The earliest extant of such chorale collections, the Dietel manuscript, also contains a SATB version of the motet's five-part third movement: Dietel's copy omitted the second soprano part of that movement.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227/3 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] retained the two other chorales, based on the motet's first (=11th) and seventh movements, in the third volume of [[Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf|Breitkopf]]'s [[18th-century prints of Bach's four-part chorales#C.

The work, in [[E&nbsp;minor]], takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing {{lang|it|[[colla parte]]}}. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre. According to [[Philipp Spitta]], [[Johann Michael Bach]]'s motet {{ill|Halt, was du hast|choralwiki|Halt, was du hast (Johann Michael Bach)|lt=''Halt, was du hast''}}, [[ABA&nbsp;I,&nbsp;10]], which contains a setting of the \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" chorale, may have been on Johann Sebastian's mind when he composed his motet named after the chorale, in E&nbsp;minor like his ancestor's.{{sfn|Spitta|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastianb02spituoft#page/601 601]}}\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} In eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\n===Time of origin===\nMost of Bach's motets are difficult to date, and {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is no exception.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Wolf (score)|2002|p=V}} Spitta assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}} In 1912, Bernhard Friedrich Richter wrote that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was likely written in Bach's first year as {{lang|de|[[Thomaskantor]]}} in Leipzig, for the funeral of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, on 18 July 1723, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the Epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=IV}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to analyse the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, which led Smend to suggest that the work was composed in the 1720s.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} Looking at the four-part settings of the chorale movements 1, 7 and 11, which seem unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Bach's Weimar period, or even earlier, Melamed thought that the motet was likely in part compiled from music Bach had composed before his Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\n[[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} According to [[Richard D.&nbsp;P. Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. Only the alto, the middle voice in the motet's SSATB setting, sings in all movements. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing {{lang|it|colla parte}} in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements, both five-part, mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements, both four-part. The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.

Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the second verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} here often expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\nPerformers of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small vocal ensemble or a larger choir, a continuo group, and instruments playing {{lang|it|colla parte}}.{{sfn|Wolf (score)|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}}\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, there is no extant [[autograph (music)|autograph]] of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}. The motet's SATB chorales were copied in several 18th-century manuscripts collecting [[List of chorale harmonisations by Johann Sebastian Bach|chorale harmonisations by Bach]].{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227/1 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227/7 at Bach Digital}} The earliest extant of such chorale collections, the Dietel manuscript, also contains a SATB version of the motet's five-part third movement: Dietel's copy omitted the second soprano part of that movement.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227/3 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] retained the two other chorales, based on the motet's first (=11th) and seventh movements, in the third volume of [[Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf|Breitkopf]]'s [[18th-century prints of Bach's four-part chorales#C.
