the instigation of Henry Langley, the first [[Anglican]] [[Bishop]] of [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]], his daughters, Ruth, Aphra and Nona took over the school in 1903.

the instigation of Henry Langley, the first [[Anglican]] [[Bishop]] of [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]], his daughters, Ruth, Aphra and Nona took over the school in 1903. The Langley sisters later changed the school's name to '''Castlemaine Girls' College''', and in 1911 to '''St Catherine's Girls College, Castlemaine''', after the Anglican school [[St Catherine's School, Sydney|St Catherine's School]] at [[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]] in [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], where Ruth and Nona Langley had been educated. St Catherine's was a nominally Anglican school at this time in its history.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn 1920, St Catherine's School moved to Williams Road in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], where 48 pupils were enrolled. Ruth Langley had been joined in 1919 by Flora Templeton, who came as co-principal from Blair School, at St Georges Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], with her students.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn 1922, '''St Catherine's Grammar School''' had 80 students, and in need of more [[Lodging|accommodation]], Langley and Templeton purchased \"Kilbride House\", formerly known as \"Beaulieu\", at 17 Heyington Place, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]]. The building was ultimately renamed \"Sherren House\" in recognition of Ruby Lawrence (n\u00e9e Sherren), who was the schools [[matron]] from 1923 to 1946. Flora Templeton died in 1931, but Ruth Langley continued the [[Academic administration|administration]] of the school, appointing Edna Holmes as [[headmistress]].

St Catherine's found a temporary home at Mountain Grand, [[Warburton, Victoria|Warburton]], and returned to Heyington Place in 1943. In 1944, Sophie Borland was appointed headmistress and worked with Hilda Langley as principal until the end of 1947, when the trustee of the late Ruth Langley decided to hand control of the school to a [[Committee|council]].

It was founded in 1823 and located in the former Palace of the Inquisition in [[Mexico City]]. Initially designated as the ''Cadet Academy'' it was renamed in 1823 as the ''Colegio Militar''. The College was relocated in Perote, [[Veracruz]], before being returned to Mexico City where it was established in the Betlemitas monastery (today occupied by the Interactive Museum of the Economy and the Museum of the Mexican Army and Air Force).  From 1835 the Military College was located in the Recogidas Building (destroyed by an earthquake in 1985). Cadets training for the Mexican Navy originally formed part of the student body but in 1897 the [[Heroica Escuela Naval Militar|Military Naval School]] was established as a separate institution in [[Veracruz]].\n\nThe Military College comes under the supervision of the [[Mexican Army and Air Force University]] and the Army Military Education General Directorate.\n\n== History of the College ==\n\n===Foundation===\nAlthough plans for a military academy were proposed as early as 1818, it would be only in 1822 when such plans materialized, with the efforts of Diego Garcia Conde, the ex-Spanish military officer then serving in the [[Mexican Army]], for such an academy to be formed were approved by the Mexican Imperial Government, through the Imperial War Ministry.\n\nIn the middle of the year, Emperor [[Agustin de Iturbide]] ordered that the  Former Inquisition Palace Complex become the headquarters of the now newly founded Military College of Mexico, the Military Cadet Academy and the Engineers Training School, all under their first director, Brigadier Diego Garcia Conde. By the next year, through the orders of War Minister General Jose Joaquin de Herrera, the  Military College of Mexico was relaunched as a separate academy with headquarters at [[San Carlos Fortress]], in [[Perote, Veracruz]] state. In 1824, in compliance with an order from [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Guadalupe Victoria]], 18 cadets of the now called ''Perote Military College of Mexico'', through the permission of then college director Col. Juan Dominguez y Galvez,  became the first cadets of the new ''Naval Aspirants College'' and the ''Tlacotalpan Nautical School'' trained to be the [[Mexican Navy]]'s future ship officers.\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Mexican cadet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A cadet of the Heroic Military Academy (Mexico) with a [[golden eagle]], the academy mascot.]]\n[[File:Mujereshcm.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Another cadet holding the golden eagle mascot. A female cadet stands in the foreground. Both wear the gala uniform of the Cadet Corps]]\nIn 1828, due to a campaign against [[Secret society|secret societies]] and [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], Lt. Col. Manuel Montano's visit became the reason for the College's first loyalty act by the Corps of Cadets and its faculty, for their response to him was that the Military College should be exempted from the campaign due to the fact that no one in the College's cadet rosters were either secret society members nor Masons, and it turned into a national act of loyalty by the college cadets and faculty. As a result of this great deed, the College in March 1828 returned to Mexico City, first in the Bethelemitas convent and later in the Inquisition Palace Complex on July 1. By then, it began to be recognized by every Mexican as the nation's premier military educational institution.\n\nThe turmoil that sparked in the 1828 presidential elections took its toll on the College cadets. On September 11, a rebellion led by Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] and Jose Maria Lobato  denounced the election results ten days before, in which Manuel Gomez Pedraza emerged as the winner. Two months later, on November 30, they together with Lorenzo de Zavala and Col. Santiago Garcia staged a coup d'\u00e9tat that took over the La {{Not a typo|Acordada}} building demanding that the election results be voided by Congress. The same day, President Victoria called on the College cadets to proceed to the National Palace, and they fought on the side of the armed forces for 4 days until the fighting ended on December 4, with a compromise reached by both sides. Class would resume later the next day.\n\nPolitical turmoil broke out again in 1840. On July 13 of that year Gen. [[Jose Urrea]] bolted out of jail and led a rebellion against President Anastacio Bustamante, who was later imprisoned in the presidential residence. General Gabriel Valencia then ordered all troops loyal to the President to proceed at once to the city citadel. These included the cadets of the Military College under its then director Brigade General Pedro Conde, who was received by Gen. Valencia and sent a delegation of cadets to the citadel. The College delegation then moved to a church where they fought anti-Bustamante troops, which resulted in two wounded cadets (Juan Rico and Antonio Groso), the former would later die of his wounds sustained. On the 16th President Bustamante left his residence and Gen. Vicente Filisola arrived at the church premises. On that night, when an armistice was made, the attempted coup was already over.\n\nThe next year, it relocated to the Chalpultepec Castle in Mexico City. This castle would be, in 6 years time, during the Mexican War, a place where 5 cadets and an officer in the faculty died in defense of the Mexican nation, and it would gain the ''Heroic'' designation. After a few years, the College relocated to the Inquisition Palace and later to San Lucas.\n\nIn 1846, the College's only naval director, Graduate Ship Captain Francisco Garcia began his duties as College Commandant, a duty lasting until 1847. A sudden rebellion by the Corps of Cadets happened during his tenure.\n\n===The Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes===\nThe following year (1847), during the first term of Col. Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura as commandant, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] reached Mexico City and the Military Academy. On September 11 cadets of the Academy were involved in fighting on the Condress Estate.  On September 13 Chapultepec Castle and its surroundings became the site of the historic [[Battle of Chapultepec]]. Its Mexican Army defenders, under the leadership of [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], former President and a veteran of the war of independence, included about 200 members of the Corps of Cadets, aged between 13 and 19. At the end of the battle five cadets -  Juan Escutia (who reportedly leapt to his death wrapped in the [[Flag of Mexico]]), Agustin Melgar, Francisco Marquez, Fernando Montes de Oca, and Vicente Su\u00e1rez; plus faculty member Lieutenant of Juan de la Barrera - all refused to retreat and died in a final stand as the \"young heroes\" of Academy legend. An unknown proportion of the other cadets became casualties or prisoners during the earlier stages of the battle.\n\nEach year on the anniversary of the battle, the sacrifice of the five [[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]] of the Military Academy is remembered nationwide, with a national ceremony at the monument with the Corps in attendance.\n\n===1857\u20131920===\nIn 1858, during the term of Commandant Colonel Luis Tola Algar\u00edn, the College moved its facilities to the former Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Mexico City.  During the [[Reform War]] the same year the Corps of Cadets was involved in a clash with the forces of Gen. Miguel Blanco on October 15 in [[Toluca]]. Casualties suffered by the cadets and instructors in this and subsequent actions caused the closure of the College in 1861.\n\nThe College was reopened in 1867. Located first in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] the College was moved to various locations before returning to the Chapultepec Castle in 1882. Formerly a joint services institution, the College became an academy for the Mexican Army only in 1897, following the establishment of the Military Naval School in Veracruz.\n\nOn 8 February 1913 the 600 cadets of the Military College played a part in the coup known as The [[Ten Tragic Days]] against President [[Francisco Madero]].<ref>Ronald Atkin, page 126 \"Revolution! Mexico 1910-20\", Granada Publishing Ltd. 1973</ref> Cadets of the separate ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' (established in 1905 as an additional academy for training junior officers) had joined with regular army units in an ultimately successful attempt to overthrow Madero. However a detachment of cadets from the Heroic Military College, acting on the orders of Deputy Commandant Lieutenant Colonel V\u00edctor Hern\u00e1ndez Covarrubias  escorted President Madero from Chapultepec Castle to the National Palace on the following day. Termed the ''Loyalty March'', this action is still marked by an annual parade by the Corps of Cadets, attended by the present-day [[President of Mexico]] and his Cabinet.\n\nThe new government down-graded the role of the Heroic Military College, briefly merging its functions with those of the ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' and accelerating the training of cadets from both academies to reinforce the crumbling Federal Army. Following the overthrow of General [[Victoriano Huerta]] in July 1914 and the disbandment of the Federal Army, the College was closed. It was reestablished in February 1920 albelt in a new campus in Popotla, Mexico City. Later that spring the then reestablished cavalry squadron were involved in what has been termed \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\". This occurred on May 8, when on the orders of Colonel Rodolfo Casillas the cadets acted in support of regular army dragoons led by General Pilar Sanchez under attack by rebel forces in Apizaco, Tlaxcala. In another engagement two days later a cadet was killed in action in San Marcos while supporting government forces.\n\n==The College from 1947 to today==\n[[File:Desfile Militar Conmemorativo del CCV Aniversario del Inicio de la Independencia de M\u00e9xico.

In 1949, the [[Congress of the Union]] formally conferred the \"Heroic\" designation to both the Corps and to the Midshipmen's Battalion of the Naval Military Academy, the latter for its role in resisting the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in 1914.\n\nTo celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Heroic Military College (1820-1970), 1 oz silver coins were minted by the Central Bank. In addition stamps featuring two Military College [[shako]]s were printed by the Government of Mexico. A special issue of stamps also commemorated the Golden Jubilee of \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\"; carried out by the cavalry cadets of the college in 1920 (see above).\n\nIn 1976, the College's present campus in [[Tlalpan]] Borough, [[Mexico City]], was formally opened, partially damaged by the 1985 earthquake that struck the city. Today, the commandant of the academy is Brigade General Julio \u00c1lvarez Arellano.\n\nThe school was used as a setting for [[Luis Miguel]]'s 1989 music video \"[[La Incondicional]]\". In the video he plays an Air Force cadet who is in love, but he must take his stuides as soldier seriously. In a marching scene towards the end of the song one can see the \"Por el Honor de Mexico\" banner.\n\nPerote, the second home of the Military College, has been dubbed by the Veracruz State Congress as ''The Cradle of the Military College'' since 2002.\n\nFrom 2007, the academy has accepted female cadets. The present Corps is regiment-sized and has among its units a cavalry squadron and an artillery battery, plus an armored cavalry training squadron raised recently - a first in a military academy in Latin America.\n\n== Motto and Collegiate Slogan ==\n''Por el Honor de Mexico'' (''For Mexico's Honor'') is the college motto, made in a contest organized by radio station XEQ in commemoration of the centenary of the defense of Chalpultepec Castle in 1947.\n\nEvery midday, after the afternoon ceremony and before the midday parade, the following cheer is done by the Corps of Cadets:\n\n* Cadet Corps Commander: \"Heroico Colegio Militar\" (\"Heroic Military College\")\n* Cadets: ''Por el Honor de Mexico!''

It was founded in 1823 and located in the former Palace of the Inquisition in [[Mexico City]]. Initially designated as the ''Cadet Academy'' it was renamed in 1823 as the ''Colegio Militar''. The College was relocated in Perote, [[Veracruz]], before being returned to Mexico City where it was established in the Betlemitas monastery (today occupied by the Interactive Museum of the Economy and the Museum of the Mexican Army and Air Force).  From 1835 the Military College was located in the Recogidas Building (destroyed by an earthquake in 1985). Cadets training for the Mexican Navy originally formed part of the student body but in 1897 the [[Heroica Escuela Naval Militar|Military Naval School]] was established as a separate institution in [[Veracruz]].\n\nThe Military College comes under the supervision of the [[Mexican Army and Air Force University]] and the Army Military Education General Directorate.\n\n== History of the College ==\n\n===Foundation===\nAlthough plans for a military academy were proposed as early as 1818, it would be only in 1822 when such plans materialized, with the efforts of Diego Garcia Conde, the ex-Spanish military officer then serving in the [[Mexican Army]], for such an academy to be formed were approved by the Mexican Imperial Government, through the Imperial War Ministry.\n\nIn the middle of the year, Emperor [[Agustin de Iturbide]] ordered that the  Former Inquisition Palace Complex become the headquarters of the now newly founded Military College of Mexico, the Military Cadet Academy and the Engineers Training School, all under their first director, Brigadier Diego Garcia Conde. By the next year, through the orders of War Minister General Jose Joaquin de Herrera, the  Military College of Mexico was relaunched as a separate academy with headquarters at [[San Carlos Fortress]], in [[Perote, Veracruz]] state. In 1824, in compliance with an order from [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Guadalupe Victoria]], 18 cadets of the now called ''Perote Military College of Mexico'', through the permission of then college director Col. Juan Dominguez y Galvez,  became the first cadets of the new ''Naval Aspirants College'' and the ''Tlacotalpan Nautical School'' trained to be the [[Mexican Navy]]'s future ship officers.\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Mexican cadet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A cadet of the Heroic Military Academy (Mexico) with a [[golden eagle]], the academy mascot.]]\n[[File:Mujereshcm.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Another cadet holding the golden eagle mascot. A female cadet stands in the foreground. Both wear the gala uniform of the Cadet Corps]]\nIn 1828, due to a campaign against [[Secret society|secret societies]] and [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], Lt. Col. Manuel Montano's visit became the reason for the College's first loyalty act by the Corps of Cadets and its faculty, for their response to him was that the Military College should be exempted from the campaign due to the fact that no one in the College's cadet rosters were either secret society members nor Masons, and it turned into a national act of loyalty by the college cadets and faculty. As a result of this great deed, the College in March 1828 returned to Mexico City, first in the Bethelemitas convent and later in the Inquisition Palace Complex on July 1. By then, it began to be recognized by every Mexican as the nation's premier military educational institution.\n\nThe turmoil that sparked in the 1828 presidential elections took its toll on the College cadets. On September 11, a rebellion led by Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] and Jose Maria Lobato  denounced the election results ten days before, in which Manuel Gomez Pedraza emerged as the winner. Two months later, on November 30, they together with Lorenzo de Zavala and Col. Santiago Garcia staged a coup d'\u00e9tat that took over the La {{Not a typo|Acordada}} building demanding that the election results be voided by Congress. The same day, President Victoria called on the College cadets to proceed to the National Palace, and they fought on the side of the armed forces for 4 days until the fighting ended on December 4, with a compromise reached by both sides. Class would resume later the next day.\n\nPolitical turmoil broke out again in 1840. On July 13 of that year Gen. [[Jose Urrea]] bolted out of jail and led a rebellion against President Anastacio Bustamante, who was later imprisoned in the presidential residence. General Gabriel Valencia then ordered all troops loyal to the President to proceed at once to the city citadel. These included the cadets of the Military College under its then director Brigade General Pedro Conde, who was received by Gen. Valencia and sent a delegation of cadets to the citadel. The College delegation then moved to a church where they fought anti-Bustamante troops, which resulted in two wounded cadets (Juan Rico and Antonio Groso), the former would later die of his wounds sustained. On the 16th President Bustamante left his residence and Gen. Vicente Filisola arrived at the church premises. On that night, when an armistice was made, the attempted coup was already over.\n\nThe next year, it relocated to the Chalpultepec Castle in Mexico City. This castle would be, in 6 years time, during the Mexican War, a place where 5 cadets and an officer in the faculty died in defense of the Mexican nation, and it would gain the ''Heroic'' designation. After a few years, the College relocated to the Inquisition Palace and later to San Lucas.\n\nIn 1846, the College's only naval director, Graduate Ship Captain Francisco Garcia began his duties as College Commandant, a duty lasting until 1847. A sudden rebellion by the Corps of Cadets happened during his tenure.\n\n===The Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes===\nThe following year (1847), during the first term of Col. Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura as commandant, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] reached Mexico City and the Military Academy. On September 11 cadets of the Academy were involved in fighting on the Condress Estate.  On September 13 Chapultepec Castle and its surroundings became the site of the historic [[Battle of Chapultepec]]. Its Mexican Army defenders, under the leadership of [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], former President and a veteran of the war of independence, included about 200 members of the Corps of Cadets, aged between 13 and 19. At the end of the battle five cadets -  Juan Escutia (who reportedly leapt to his death wrapped in the [[Flag of Mexico]]), Agustin Melgar, Francisco Marquez, Fernando Montes de Oca, and Vicente Su\u00e1rez; plus faculty member Lieutenant of Juan de la Barrera - all refused to retreat and died in a final stand as the \"young heroes\" of Academy legend. An unknown proportion of the other cadets became casualties or prisoners during the earlier stages of the battle.\n\nEach year on the anniversary of the battle, the sacrifice of the five [[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]] of the Military Academy is remembered nationwide, with a national ceremony at the monument with the Corps in attendance.\n\n===1857\u20131920===\nIn 1858, during the term of Commandant Colonel Luis Tola Algar\u00edn, the College moved its facilities to the former Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Mexico City.  During the [[Reform War]] the same year the Corps of Cadets was involved in a clash with the forces of Gen. Miguel Blanco on October 15 in [[Toluca]]. Casualties suffered by the cadets and instructors in this and subsequent actions caused the closure of the College in 1861.\n\nThe College was reopened in 1867. Located first in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] the College was moved to various locations before returning to the Chapultepec Castle in 1882. Formerly a joint services institution, the College became an academy for the Mexican Army only in 1897, following the establishment of the Military Naval School in Veracruz.\n\nOn 8 February 1913 the 600 cadets of the Military College played a part in the coup known as The [[Ten Tragic Days]] against President [[Francisco Madero]].<ref>Ronald Atkin, page 126 \"Revolution! Mexico 1910-20\", Granada Publishing Ltd. 1973</ref> Cadets of the separate ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' (established in 1905 as an additional academy for training junior officers) had joined with regular army units in an ultimately successful attempt to overthrow Madero. However a detachment of cadets from the Heroic Military College, acting on the orders of Deputy Commandant Lieutenant Colonel V\u00edctor Hern\u00e1ndez Covarrubias  escorted President Madero from Chapultepec Castle to the National Palace on the following day. Termed the ''Loyalty March'', this action is still marked by an annual parade by the Corps of Cadets, attended by the present-day [[President of Mexico]] and his Cabinet.\n\nThe new government down-graded the role of the Heroic Military College, briefly merging its functions with those of the ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' and accelerating the training of cadets from both academies to reinforce the crumbling Federal Army. Following the overthrow of General [[Victoriano Huerta]] in July 1914 and the disbandment of the Federal Army, the College was closed. It was reestablished in February 1920 albelt in a new campus in Popotla, Mexico City. Later that spring the then reestablished cavalry squadron were involved in what has been termed \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\". This occurred on May 8, when on the orders of Colonel Rodolfo Casillas the cadets acted in support of regular army dragoons led by General Pilar Sanchez under attack by rebel forces in Apizaco, Tlaxcala.

In addition stamps featuring two Military College [[shako]]s were printed by the Government of Mexico. A special issue of stamps also commemorated the Golden Jubilee of \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\"; carried out by the cavalry cadets of the college in 1920 (see above).\n\nIn 1976, the College's present campus in [[Tlalpan]] Borough, [[Mexico City]], was formally opened, partially damaged by the 1985 earthquake that struck the city. Today, the commandant of the academy is Brigade General Julio \u00c1lvarez Arellano.\n\nThe school was used as a setting for [[Luis Miguel]]'s 1989 music video \"[[La Incondicional]]\". In the video he plays an Air Force cadet who is in love, but he must take his stuides as soldier seriously. In a marching scene towards the end of the song one can see the \"Por el Honor de Mexico\" banner.\n\nPerote, the second home of the Military College, has been dubbed by the Veracruz State Congress as ''The Cradle of the Military College'' since 2002.\n\nFrom 2007, the academy has accepted female cadets. The present Corps is regiment-sized and has among its units a cavalry squadron and an artillery battery, plus an armored cavalry training squadron raised recently - a first in a military academy in Latin America.\n\n== Motto and Collegiate Slogan ==\n''Por el Honor de Mexico'' (''For Mexico's Honor'') is the college motto, made in a contest organized by radio station XEQ in commemoration of the centenary of the defense of Chalpultepec Castle in 1947.\n\nEvery midday, after the afternoon ceremony and before the midday parade, the following cheer is done by the Corps of Cadets:\n\n* Cadet Corps Commander: \"Heroico Colegio Militar\" (\"Heroic Military College\")\n* Cadets: ''Por el Honor de Mexico!'' (''For Mexico's Honor!'')\n\n== Collegiate Hymn and March ==\n\n=== Hymn of the Heroic Military College ===\n[[File:Ceremonia_en_Her\u00f3ico_Colegio_Militar.JPG|thumb|350px|right|A military parade part of a ceremony on Heroico Colegio Militar at Tlalpan, Mexico City.]]\n[[File:Colegio_mil.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Military College]]\nThe Hymn of the Heroic Military College was composed in 1930 by Prof. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio R\u00edos del R\u00edo.<ref name=\"sedena.gob.mx\">http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php?id=234</ref>\n\n===Lyrics===\n'''Spanish'''<br />\n''Chorus'' <br />\nVibre el clar\u00edn de la guerra, resuenen las fanfarrias<br />\nRedoblen los tambores, una marcha triunfal<br />\nY lleven de la Patria a todos los confines<br />\nTu nombre sacrosanto,<br /> \nColegio Militar<br />\nTu nombre sacrosanto,<br /> \nColegio Militar\n\n''Verse<br />\nColegio sacrosanto, de memoria bendita<br />\nde forjaran sus almas, Montes de Oca y Melgar<br />\nLa Patria bate marcha de honor a tu pasado,<br />\nde epopeyas gloriosas y de nombre inmortal.\n\nY en un gesto sublime de amor y de cari\u00f1o,<br />\nbendice a los efebos que supieron morir <br />\nba\u00f1ados por las r\u00e1fagas de luz espendorosa<br />\nque el \u00e1ngel de la gloria enviara del cenit.\n\n''Repeat Chorus''\n\n=== Regimental March of the Heroic Military College ===\nThe Regimental March was composed by Lieutenant Jos\u00e9 Sotero Ortiz S\u00e1nchez, in time for the College's 1947 centenary of the Battle of Chapultepec.\n\n===Lyrics===\n[[File:Escolta_hcm.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Listen hcm]]\n'''Spanish'''<br />\nP\u00e1ginas del libro de la historia del Heroico Colegio Militar<br />\nde epopeyas que ya jam\u00e1s se borran del santuario de la inmortalidad.<br />\nCanto que se eleva a la memoria como ofrenda de honor a la lealtad <br />\nde los h\u00e9roes que envueltos por la gloria grandioso ejemplo que nos dio la libertad. <br />\n''Repeat All''\n\nJuventud de mi patria sublime, que march\u00e1is con gallarda ilusi\u00f3n<br /> \naument\u00e1reis la historia que escribe nobles hechos de sangre y honor.<br /> \nYunque forjador de hombres de guerra como Su\u00e1rez, Escutia y Melgar,<br />\nMontes de Oca, M\u00e1rquez y De la Barrera, los ni\u00f1os h\u00e9roes de mi M\u00e9xico inmortal!<br />\n''Repeat All''\n\n== Commandants ==\n<ref>[http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/educacion-militar/planteles-militares/heroico-colegio-militar/historia-hcm/directores-hcm Directores del Heroico Colegio Militar], [[Secretariat of National Defense (Mexico)]] (SEDENA)</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.!!Period!!Rank!!!!Notes\n|-\n|1||1818\u20131823||Brigadier General||[[Diego Garc\u00eda Conde]]||\n|-\n|2||1823\u20131824||Cavalry Colonel||[[Juan Dom\u00ednguez y G\u00e1lvez]]||\n|-\n|3||1825\u20131828||Cavalry Lieutenant Colonel||[[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Arechaga]]||\n|-\n|4||1835\u20131836||Engineers Colonel||[[Ignacio Mora y Villamil]]||\n|-\n|5||1836\u20131846||Brigadier General||[[Pedro Garc\u00eda Conde]]\n|-\n|6||1846\u20131847||Graduate Captain, Commander||[[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]]||Only naval officer commandant of the College\n|-\n|7||1847\u20131853||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura]]||Led the defense of [[Chapultepec Castle]] during the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] which took a heavy toll for the Academy\n|-\n|8||1853\u20131854||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Santiago Blanco Duque de Estrada]]||\n|-\n|9||1854\u20131859||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Luis Tola Algar\u00edn]]||\n|-\n|10||1859\u20131860||Engineers Colonel (Staff)||Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura||2nd Period\n|-\n|11||1861\u20131863||Brigade General||[[Jos\u00e9 Justo Alvarez Valenzuela]]||\n|-\n|12||1868\u20131871||Engineers Colonel||[[Amado Camacho]]||\n|-\n|13||1871\u20131880||Engineers Colonel||[[Miguel Quintana Gonz\u00e1lez]]||\n|-\n|14||1880\u20131883||Divisional General||[[S\u00f3stenes Rocha]]||\n|-\n|15||1883\u20131884||General Graduado, Coronel Tec. de Artiller\u00eda||[[Francisco de Paula M\u00e9ndez]]||\n|-\n|16||1884\u20131906||Engineers Colonel General||[[Juan Villegas (general)|Juan Villegas]]||Highest-ranking officer commandant of the College\n|-\n|17||1906\u20131912||General de Brigada de E.M.
