They became known as the Raj Darbhanga. The extent of their lands, which were not contiguous, varied over time, and their area of ownership was smaller than the area that they were granted under [[Deed#Sanad|sanad]] arrangements. A particularly significant reduction occurred when the influence of the [[British Raj]] caused them to lose control of the territories that were in Nepal but, nonetheless, their holdings were considerable. One estimate suggests that when their rule came to an end, the territories comprised around {{convert|6200|sqkm|sqmi}}, with around 4500 villages.<ref name=\"rorabacher\">{{cite book |title=Bihar and Mithila: The Historical Roots of Backwardness |first=J.

The Brahmins were dominant in the Mithila region and Mithila had Brahmin kings in the past.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nAkbar summoned Rajpandit Chandrapati Thakur to Delhi and asked him to name one of his sons who could be made caretaker and tax collector for his lands in Mithila. Chandrapati Thakur named his middle son, Mahesh Thakur, and Akbar declared Mahesh Thakur as the caretaker of Mithila on the day of [[Ram Navami]] in 1557 AD.\n\n===Consolidation===\nThe family and descendants of Mahesh Thakur gradually consolidated their power in social, agrarian, and political matters and came to be regarded as kings of [[Madhubani district|Madhubani]]. Darbhanga became the seat of power of the Raj Darbhanga family from 1762. They also had a palace at [[Rajnagar Bihar]] situated in Madhubani district. They bought land from local people. They became known as a ''Khandavala'' family (the richest landlord).\n\nFor a period of twenty years (1860\u20131880), Darbhanga Raj was placed under the [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]] by the [[British Raj]]. During this period, Darbhanga Raj was involved in litigation regarding succession. This litigation decided that the estate was impartible and succession was to be governed by primogeniture.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Zamindari estates in the region, including Darbhanga, actually sought intervention of the Court of Wards from time to time because the stewardship of the British authorities, who invested funds wisely, had a tendency to boost their economic position. The estate had in any event been badly run prior to this time: a complex system influenced by both nepotism and sycophancy had dramatically affected the family's rental income. The bureaucratic system introduced by the Court, whose appointed officials had no ties to the area, resolved the issue although, being focussed entirely on what was best for the owners, it did so without considering the consequences for the tenants.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Limited Raj: Agrarian Relations in Colonial India, Saran District, 1793-1920 |first=Anand A. |last=Yang |pages=83\u201386 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-52005-711-1 |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA83 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730224652/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA83 |archive-date=30 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, 47 percent of the cropped area of the Darbhanga estate was used for the cultivation of rice.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Limited Raj: Agrarian Relations in Colonial India, Saran District, 1793-1920 |first=Anand A. |last=Yang |page=37 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-52005-711-1 |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA37 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730230931/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA37 |archive-date=30 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Three percent of total cultivation was given over to [[indigo]] at that time, making the estate one of the most important centres in the region for this crop prior to the introduction of chemical dyes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Peasant History of Late Pre-colonial and Colonial India |volume=8 |first=B.

The fortunes of Darbhanga Raj dwindled.\n\nThe last ruler of Raj Darbhanga was Maharaja Bahadur Sir Kameshwar Singh. He died in 1960 without naming a successor.<ref name=\"rorabacher\"/>\n\n==Controversy over royal status==\nThe origin of the royal family of Darbhanga is traced to a grant of the Sarkar of [[Tirhut]] to Mahesh Thakur by Akbar. The supporters of the theory that Raj Darbhanga was a kingdom argue that it was held by [[privy council]], that the rulership was a hereditary one with succession governed by [[primogeniture]].

They became known as the Raj Darbhanga. The extent of their lands, which were not contiguous, varied over time, and their area of ownership was smaller than the area that they were granted under [[Deed#Sanad|sanad]] arrangements. A particularly significant reduction occurred when the influence of the [[British Raj]] caused them to lose control of the territories that were in Nepal but, nonetheless, their holdings were considerable. One estimate suggests that when their rule came to an end, the territories comprised around {{convert|6200|sqkm|sqmi}}, with around 4500 villages.<ref name=\"rorabacher\">{{cite book |title=Bihar and Mithila: The Historical Roots of Backwardness |first=J.

Tughlaq had attacked and taken control of Bihar, and from the end of the Tughlaq Empire until the establishment of the Mughal Empire in 1526 there was anarchy and chaos in the region. [[Akbar]] (ruled 1556\u20131605) realised that taxes from Mithila could only be collected if there was a king who could ensure peace there. The Brahmins were dominant in the Mithila region and Mithila had Brahmin kings in the past.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nAkbar summoned Rajpandit Chandrapati Thakur to Delhi and asked him to name one of his sons who could be made caretaker and tax collector for his lands in Mithila. Chandrapati Thakur named his middle son, Mahesh Thakur, and Akbar declared Mahesh Thakur as the caretaker of Mithila on the day of [[Ram Navami]] in 1557 AD.\n\n===Consolidation===\nThe family and descendants of Mahesh Thakur gradually consolidated their power in social, agrarian, and political matters and came to be regarded as kings of [[Madhubani district|Madhubani]]. Darbhanga became the seat of power of the Raj Darbhanga family from 1762. They also had a palace at [[Rajnagar Bihar]] situated in Madhubani district. They bought land from local people. They became known as a ''Khandavala'' family (the richest landlord).\n\nFor a period of twenty years (1860\u20131880), Darbhanga Raj was placed under the [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]] by the [[British Raj]]. During this period, Darbhanga Raj was involved in litigation regarding succession. This litigation decided that the estate was impartible and succession was to be governed by primogeniture.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Zamindari estates in the region, including Darbhanga, actually sought intervention of the Court of Wards from time to time because the stewardship of the British authorities, who invested funds wisely, had a tendency to boost their economic position. The estate had in any event been badly run prior to this time: a complex system influenced by both nepotism and sycophancy had dramatically affected the family's rental income. The bureaucratic system introduced by the Court, whose appointed officials had no ties to the area, resolved the issue although, being focussed entirely on what was best for the owners, it did so without considering the consequences for the tenants.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Limited Raj: Agrarian Relations in Colonial India, Saran District, 1793-1920 |first=Anand A. |last=Yang |pages=83\u201386 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-52005-711-1 |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA83 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730224652/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA83 |archive-date=30 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, 47 percent of the cropped area of the Darbhanga estate was used for the cultivation of rice.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Limited Raj: Agrarian Relations in Colonial India, Saran District, 1793-1920 |first=Anand A. |last=Yang |page=37 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-52005-711-1 |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA37 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730230931/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ck4jmD7H34UC&pg=PA37 |archive-date=30 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Three percent of total cultivation was given over to [[indigo]] at that time, making the estate one of the most important centres in the region for this crop prior to the introduction of chemical dyes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Peasant History of Late Pre-colonial and Colonial India |volume=8 |first=B.

The supporters of the theory that Raj Darbhanga was a kingdom argue that it was held by [[privy council]], that the rulership was a hereditary one with succession governed by [[primogeniture]]. The supporters argue that by the end of the 18th century, the Sarkar of Tirhut was practically an independent kingdom until the conquest of Bengal and Bihar by the British.<ref>Jnanendra Nath Kumar \u2013 The Genealogical History of India</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe opponents of the theory argue that Raj Darbhanga was never a kingdom but rather a [[zamindari]] with all the trappings of [[princely state]]. The rulers of Raj Darbhanga were the largest landowners in India, and thus were called Raja, and later Maharaja and Maharajadhiraja. They were given the status of ruling prince.<ref>Lakshmana Jha \u2013 Mithila: A Union Republic</ref>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}} Further, after conquest of Bengal and Bihar, the British Raj initiated the [[Permanent Settlement]], and the Raja of Darbhanga was recognised only as a Zamindar.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Raj Darbhanga also paid yearly lagan (land tax) to old existing Zamindar of Darbhanga, Kachari at Khan Sahib ki deaorhi.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Rulers==\n*  Raja Mahesh Thakur (died 1558).\n*  Raja Gopal Thakur.

He obtained a lease for the whole of Sarkar Tirhut including Darbhanga and [[Muzaffarpur]] at an annual rent of Rs. 100,000, which was a huge amount at that time. The annual revenue of Sarkar Tirhut in 1685 was Rs. {{formatnum:769287}}. During his reign, Nawab Mahabat Jung, the ''Nawab Subahdar'' of Behar, was jealous of his wealth and imprisoned his family at Patna. Raghu Singh escaped capture and succeeded in getting the estate back along with a large grant from the Mughal Governor on the condition that he \"do justice, relieve distress, and put the country in flourishing condition.\" This condition was fulfilled by Raja Raghu Singh and subsequent Maharajas of Darbhanga. He built a mud fort at Bhawara near Madhubani.\n*  Raja Bishnu Singh (ruled 1736 to 1740) (died 1740).\n*  Raja Narendra Singh (ruled 1740 to 1760) (died 1760). He died without issue but adopted Pratap Singh, great-great-grandson of Narayan Thakur, as his successor.\n*  Raja Pratap Singh (ruled 1760 to 1776) (died 1776). He built Rajbari at Darbhanga and moved the capital to Darbhanga from Bhawara.\n*  Raja Madho Singh (ruled 1776 to 1808) (died 1808). He was a younger brother of Pratap Singh and succeeded him upon his death. In 1776, he received a grant of land at Dharampur in [[Purnea district]] from [[Shah Alam II]], the Mughal Emperor of India. He had a long dispute with the British government over revenue payments and the extent of his rights over the land.\n*  Maharaja Chhatra Singh Bahadur (ruled 1808 to 1839) (died 1839). He was the second son of Madho Singh and the first in the family to hold the title of Maharaja Bahadur. Chhatra Singh made over his estate and title to his eldest son, Rudra Singh, on the grounds of old age in 1839. He died a few days later after the son's coronation.\n*  Maharaja Rudra Singh Bahadur (ruled 1839 to 1850) (died 1850). After the death of Chhatra Singh, the younger brothers of Rudra Singh  were involved in a long litigation for succession to the estate. It was ultimately held by the High Court of Calcutta that the ordinary [[Hindu Law of Succession]] could not apply in the case and the Raj Darbhanga family would have to follow the family custom or ''Kulachar''. Rudra Singh, being the eldest son of Chhatra Singh, was declared to be Maharaja of Darbhanga. This permanently settled the issue of succession and thereafter the succession was based upon primogeniture.\n*  Maharaja Maheshwar Singh Bahadur (ruled 1850 to 1860) (died 1860). He died in October 1860, leaving behind two sons, Lakshmeshwar Singh and Rameshwar Singh, both of whom became Maharajas of Darbhanga.\n[[File:Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh statue - Kolkata.JPG|thumb|Statue of Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh at Dalhousie Square, Kolkata]]\n*  [[Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh]] Bahadur (ruled 1860 to 1898) (born 25 September 1858, died 17 December 1898).

Lakshmeshwar Singh was only two years old his father's death so Raj Darbhanga was placed under Ward of Court. He was the first Maharaja of Darbhanga to receive a western education, from a British tutor, Chester Mcnaughton ( who was later the founding principal of the [[Rajkumar College, Rajkot]] ), and took over the reins of Raj Darbhanga on 25 September 1879 after attaining his majority. He devoted himself to public works and was recognised as one of the greatest nobles and philanthropists of India at that time.

He was the first person in India to get a bust of Mahatma Gandhi made, by celebrated artist [[Clare Sheridan]], cousin of [[Winston Churchill]]. The bust was presented to the viceroy of India, [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow]], to be displayed in Government House (now Rashtrapati Bhawan).

NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Modern Paganism#Ethnicity and region|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]], or a combination thereof, and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements|neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement]] within black metal. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".<ref name=\"Gardell\">Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307</ref>\n\nNSBM artists are not always explicit with their political beliefs in the music, instead expressing their beliefs offstage.<ref name=reichsrock>{{cite book|last1=Dyck|first1=Kirsten|title=Reichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music|date=2016|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick|isbn=9780813574738|pages=58\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sREVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] or [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed NSBM by the greater black metal scene, but may be labelled as such by outside analysts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html |title=Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im \"SO 36\" |publisher=BIFFF ...|language=de}}</ref> Some black metal bands have also made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}}\n\nThe emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] in the early 1990s, particularly through the band [[Burzum]], whose sole member, [[Varg Vikernes]], developed his [[Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs and antagonism to Christianity into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes. The movement became especially popular in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing [[White power music|white power musical forms]] such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The associated United States political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In the early 2000s, bands such the Ukrainian [[Drudkh]] and [[Kroda]] and the Russian \u041c8\u041b8\u0422\u0425 continued the scene's popularity in Eastern Europe. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, where it is closely linked to the activities of the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] network [[Azov Battalion]] and functions as an international hub for neo-Nazism and other far-right politics.\n\n==Black metal==\n{{Main|Black metal}}\nBlack metal is a style of [[extreme metal]] music that originated in the 1980s from the work of [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[England]]) \u2014 whose 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' coined the term for the genre, [[Mercyful Fate]] (from [[Copenhagen]], Denmark), [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] (from [[V\u00e4llingby]], Sweden), [[Slayer]] (from [[Huntington Park, California]], United States), [[Hellhammer]] (from [[N\u00fcrensdorf]], Switzerland), [[Celtic Frost]] (from [[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland), and [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] (from [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany).<ref name=\"Stylus Magazine\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Moynihan & Soderlind, 2009, p. 10</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Venkatesh|first=Vivek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwSXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA368#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Educational, Psychological, and Behavioral Considerations in Niche Online Communities|last2=Podoshen|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Perri|first3=David|last4=Urbaniak|first4=Kathryn|date=2014-02-28|publisher=[[IGI Global]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4666-5207-1|editor-last=Venkatesh|editor-first=Vivek|location=Hershey|pages=368|language=en|chapter=21: From Pride and Prejudice to Shame: Multiple Facets of the Black Metal Scene within and without Online Environments|editor-last2=Wallin|editor-first2=Jason|editor-last3=Castro|editor-first3=Juan Carlos|editor-last4=Lewis|editor-first4=Jason Edward}}</ref> A lyrical focus that is anti-Christian, Satanist, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], or a combination thereof, is often considered a prerequisite for the genre, and originally the term \"black metal\" was synonymous with \"Satanic metal\".<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=6-668|title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide|last=Kalis|first=Quentin|date=August 31, 2004|website=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Stan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false1|title=The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music and Social Class|last2=Nielsen|first2=Nina|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2020|isbn=9781501345388|editor-last=Peddie|editor-first=Ian|location=London|pages=193|chapter=Gaahl - Monster or Postmodern Prometheus?

NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Modern Paganism#Ethnicity and region|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]], or a combination thereof, and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements|neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement]] within black metal. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".<ref name=\"Gardell\">Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307</ref>\n\nNSBM artists are not always explicit with their political beliefs in the music, instead expressing their beliefs offstage.<ref name=reichsrock>{{cite book|last1=Dyck|first1=Kirsten|title=Reichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music|date=2016|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick|isbn=9780813574738|pages=58\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sREVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] or [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed NSBM by the greater black metal scene, but may be labelled as such by outside analysts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html |title=Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im \"SO 36\" |publisher=BIFFF ...|language=de}}</ref> Some black metal bands have also made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}}\n\nThe emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] in the early 1990s, particularly through the band [[Burzum]], whose sole member, [[Varg Vikernes]], developed his [[Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs and antagonism to Christianity into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes. The movement became especially popular in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing [[White power music|white power musical forms]] such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The associated United States political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany.

The screenplay by [[Melvyn Bragg]], based on ''Beloved Friend'', a collection of personal correspondence edited by Catherine Drinker Bowen and Barbara von Meck, focuses on the life and career of 19th-century Russian composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. It was one of the director's [[biographical film]]s about classical composers, which include ''[[Elgar (film)|Elgar]]'' (1962), ''[[Song of Summer|Delius: Song of Summer]]'' (1968), ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]'' (1974) and ''[[Lisztomania (film)|Lisztomania]]'' (1975), made from an often idiosyncratic standpoint.\n\n==Synopsis==\nMuch of the film is without dialogue and the story is presented in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[nightmare]]s, and [[fantasy]] sequences set to Tchaikovsky's music. As a child, the composer sees his mother die horribly, forcibly immersed in scalding water as a supposed cure for [[cholera]], and is haunted by the scene throughout his musical career. Despite his difficulty in establishing his reputation, he attracts Madame [[Nadezhda von Meck]] as his patron. His marriage to the [[nymphomania]]cal [[Antonina Miliukova]] is plagued by his homosexual urges and [[lust]]ful desire for Count Anton Chiluvsky. The dynamics of his life lead to deteriorating mental health and the loss of von Meck's patronage, and he dies of cholera after deliberately drinking contaminated water.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Richard Chamberlain]]...

Odile (in Swan Lake ballet)\n*[[Harry Fielder]]... Gentleman (uncredited)\n*[[Peter White (actor)|Peter White]]... Von Rothbart (in Swan Lake ballet, uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Harry Saltzman]] had seen some of Russell's television work and wanted to make a film with him. Russell had made a number of movies on television about composers and artists, including Debussy and Richard Strauss, and suggested a biopic of Tchaikovsky, who he had long admired. Saltzman wanted to do something more commercial, leading to ''[[Billion Dollar Brain]]''. After that movie Russell tried to get Saltzman to finance the Tchaikovsky film again but the producer declined as [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] was making his own Tchaikovsky movie.<ref>Russell p 55</ref><ref name=\"let\"/>\n\nEventually United Artists agreed to finance following the success of ''Women in Love''. Russell later claimed \"if I hadn't told United Artists that it was a story about a homosexual who fell in love with a nymphomaniac it might have never been financed.\"<ref>Russell p 56</ref><ref name=\"let\"/>\n\nThe movie was originally called ''Tchaikovsky''. It focused on the years 1874-76 which Russell felt were the most crucial in the composer's life.<ref name=\"guard\">Russell's time\nLennon, Peter.

Los Angeles Times 14 Dec 1969: r34. </ref> The film's title card eventually reads ''Ken Russell's Film on Tchaikovsky and The Music Lovers'' .\n\nRussell said \"the film is about the fact that Tchaikovsky couldn't love anyone even though he wrote some of the world's most beautiful music. He loved himself really and his sister. The film is about how artists transcend personal problems , how he used these problems and their results to create this particular kind of music.\"<ref name=\"ken\">Ken Russell: A Director Who Respects Artists Kahan, Saul. Los Angeles Times 28 Mar 1971: n18.</ref>\n\nThe director later added \"there's as much tranquility in my film on Tchaikovsky as there is in his music.\"<ref>Russell p 57</ref>\n\n\"Great heroes are the stuff of myth and legend, not facts,\" he added. \"Music and facts don't mix. Tchaikovsky said: \"My life is in my music.\" And who can deny that the man's music is not utterly fantastic? So likewise the movie! I sought to honour his genius by offering up my own small portion of his courage to create.\"<ref name=\"let\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/01/1|title=\nA film about Tchaikovsky?

Both accepted, but Bates then changed his mind. Russell felt this was because Bates \"thought it might not be good for his image to play two sexually deviant parts in rapid succession.\"<ref>Russell p 57</ref>\n\nUnited Artists wanted a star to play Tchaikovsky but Russell struggled to find someone who was willing. Eventually someone suggested Richard Chamberlain, who had relocated to the UK. Russell said \"When his name was originally put forward I nearly had a heart attack. I'd only seen him as a bland TV doctor.\"<ref>Russell p 57</ref> However the director changed his mind after he saw the actor in a TV version of ''Portrait of a Lady'' (\"I knew we had a contender\"). When he discovered that Chamberlain was a skilled piano player, the actor was cast.<ref>Russell p 57</ref>\n\nChamberlain called the role \"easily the biggest challenge of my career.\"<ref>Siegel p 76</ref> Russell said Chamberlain \"had a certain quiet dignity... which I felt the character needed. He was good to work with, very gentle and sweet; he did everything we asked him.\"<ref>Siegel p 76</ref> \n===Production===\nJackson said the filmmakers tried to research insane asylums in Russia at the time by asking the Russian embassy \"but they told us they were all wonderful so we ended up literally making the film out of the imagination of Ken Russell.\"<ref name=\"rex\"/>\n\nJackson said \"I think people will love it or hate it but I doubt that anyone will go away feeling nothing. I think it's really quite extraordinary.\"<ref name=\"rex\">She Began In a Furor: Rex Reed\nThe Washington Post, Times Herald 31 Jan 1971: E6. </ref> She also said she preferred ''Women in Love'' to ''The Music Lovers'' \"because it had the better script and that makes all the difference.\"<ref>From Humdrum to an Oscar\nChamplin, Charles.

In real life their paths accidentally crossed in an Italian park. Later, his wife Nina loses her mind and is placed in an insane asylum; in reality she was not institutionalised until after his death.\n\n[[Glenda Jackson]] and [[Andrew Faulds]] later served together as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] from 1992 to 1997, while the screenwriter Melvyn Bragg has been a Labour member of the [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom|House of Lords]] since 1998.\n==Soundtrack==\nThe [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by Andr\u00e9 Previn, performs excerpts from the following pieces by Tchaikovsky:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto in B-flat minor]] (soloist [[Rafael Orozco (pianist)|Rafael Orozco]])\n* ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (soprano [[April Cantelo]])\n* [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6 in B minor, ''Path\u00e9tique'']]\n* ''[[Manfred Symphony]]''\n* ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''\n* ''[[1812 Overture]]''\n* [[Hamlet (Tchaikovsky)|Incidental music to ''Hamlet'']]\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 5 in E minor]]\n* [[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 4 in F minor]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Globalize|article|North America|date=December 2010}}\nThe film received mostly bad reviews when it was released in the United States, but, elsewhere, has since become somewhat of a [[cult film]].

The screenplay by [[Melvyn Bragg]], based on ''Beloved Friend'', a collection of personal correspondence edited by Catherine Drinker Bowen and Barbara von Meck, focuses on the life and career of 19th-century Russian composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. It was one of the director's [[biographical film]]s about classical composers, which include ''[[Elgar (film)|Elgar]]'' (1962), ''[[Song of Summer|Delius: Song of Summer]]'' (1968), ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]'' (1974) and ''[[Lisztomania (film)|Lisztomania]]'' (1975), made from an often idiosyncratic standpoint.\n\n==Synopsis==\nMuch of the film is without dialogue and the story is presented in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[nightmare]]s, and [[fantasy]] sequences set to Tchaikovsky's music. As a child, the composer sees his mother die horribly, forcibly immersed in scalding water as a supposed cure for [[cholera]], and is haunted by the scene throughout his musical career. Despite his difficulty in establishing his reputation, he attracts Madame [[Nadezhda von Meck]] as his patron. His marriage to the [[nymphomania]]cal [[Antonina Miliukova]] is plagued by his homosexual urges and [[lust]]ful desire for Count Anton Chiluvsky. The dynamics of his life lead to deteriorating mental health and the loss of von Meck's patronage, and he dies of cholera after deliberately drinking contaminated water.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Richard Chamberlain]]... [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]\n*[[Glenda Jackson]]... [[Antonina Miliukova]]\n*[[Max Adrian]]... [[Nikolai Rubinstein]]\n*[[Christopher Gable]]... Count Anton Chiluvsky\n*[[Kenneth Colley]]... [[Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]\n*[[Izabella Telezynska]]... [[Nadezhda von Meck]]\n*[[Maureen Pryor]]... Nina's Mother\n*[[Sabina Maydelle]]... Sasha Tchaikovsky\n*[[Andrew Faulds]]...

Odile (in Swan Lake ballet)\n*[[Harry Fielder]]... Gentleman (uncredited)\n*[[Peter White (actor)|Peter White]]... Von Rothbart (in Swan Lake ballet, uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Harry Saltzman]] had seen some of Russell's television work and wanted to make a film with him. Russell had made a number of movies on television about composers and artists, including Debussy and Richard Strauss, and suggested a biopic of Tchaikovsky, who he had long admired. Saltzman wanted to do something more commercial, leading to ''[[Billion Dollar Brain]]''. After that movie Russell tried to get Saltzman to finance the Tchaikovsky film again but the producer declined as [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] was making his own Tchaikovsky movie.<ref>Russell p 55</ref><ref name=\"let\"/>\n\nEventually United Artists agreed to finance following the success of ''Women in Love''. Russell later claimed \"if I hadn't told United Artists that it was a story about a homosexual who fell in love with a nymphomaniac it might have never been financed.\"<ref>Russell p 56</ref><ref name=\"let\"/>\n\nThe movie was originally called ''Tchaikovsky''. It focused on the years 1874-76 which Russell felt were the most crucial in the composer's life.<ref name=\"guard\">Russell's time\nLennon, Peter. The Guardian 1 Nov 1969: 7. </ref> \n\nThe script was based on a collection of letters from Tchaikovsky, ''Beloved Friend'', published in 1937.<ref>The Story of Tchaikovsky and Nadejda von Meck New York Times 31 Jan 1937: 91</ref>\n\nThe title was changed to ''The Lonely Heart'' to differentiate it from ''[[Tchaikovsky (film)|Tchaikovsky]]'', a Russian film released the previous year.<ref>Tiomkin Goes Home for Film\nBlume, Mary. Los Angeles Times 14 Dec 1969: r34. </ref> The film's title card eventually reads ''Ken Russell's Film on Tchaikovsky and The Music Lovers'' .\n\nRussell said \"the film is about the fact that Tchaikovsky couldn't love anyone even though he wrote some of the world's most beautiful music. He loved himself really and his sister. The film is about how artists transcend personal problems , how he used these problems and their results to create this particular kind of music.\"<ref name=\"ken\">Ken Russell: A Director Who Respects Artists Kahan, Saul. Los Angeles Times 28 Mar 1971: n18.</ref>\n\nThe director later added \"there's as much tranquility in my film on Tchaikovsky as there is in his music.\"<ref>Russell p 57</ref>\n\n\"Great heroes are the stuff of myth and legend, not facts,\" he added. \"Music and facts don't mix. Tchaikovsky said: \"My life is in my music.\" And who can deny that the man's music is not utterly fantastic? So likewise the movie! I sought to honour his genius by offering up my own small portion of his courage to create.\"<ref name=\"let\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/01/1|title=\nA film about Tchaikovsky?

Both accepted, but Bates then changed his mind. Russell felt this was because Bates \"thought it might not be good for his image to play two sexually deviant parts in rapid succession.\"<ref>Russell p 57</ref>\n\nUnited Artists wanted a star to play Tchaikovsky but Russell struggled to find someone who was willing. Eventually someone suggested Richard Chamberlain, who had relocated to the UK. Russell said \"When his name was originally put forward I nearly had a heart attack. I'd only seen him as a bland TV doctor.\"<ref>Russell p 57</ref> However the director changed his mind after he saw the actor in a TV version of ''Portrait of a Lady'' (\"I knew we had a contender\"). When he discovered that Chamberlain was a skilled piano player, the actor was cast.<ref>Russell p 57</ref>\n\nChamberlain called the role \"easily the biggest challenge of my career.\"<ref>Siegel p 76</ref> Russell said Chamberlain \"had a certain quiet dignity... which I felt the character needed. He was good to work with, very gentle and sweet; he did everything we asked him.\"<ref>Siegel p 76</ref> \n===Production===\nJackson said the filmmakers tried to research insane asylums in Russia at the time by asking the Russian embassy \"but they told us they were all wonderful so we ended up literally making the film out of the imagination of Ken Russell.\"<ref name=\"rex\"/>\n\nJackson said \"I think people will love it or hate it but I doubt that anyone will go away feeling nothing. I think it's really quite extraordinary.\"<ref name=\"rex\">She Began In a Furor: Rex Reed\nThe Washington Post, Times Herald 31 Jan 1971: E6. </ref> She also said she preferred ''Women in Love'' to ''The Music Lovers'' \"because it had the better script and that makes all the difference.\"<ref>From Humdrum to an Oscar\nChamplin, Charles. Los Angeles Times 4 June 1971: f1. </ref>\n\n[[Rafael Orozco (pianist)|Rafael Orozco]] recorded the piano pieces played by Tchaikovsky in the film.\n\nDirector Russell hired his wife Shirley as costume designer and cast four of their children \u2013  Alexander, Victoria, James, and Xavier \u2013 in small roles.<ref name=\"guard\"/>\n\nIn one sequence, Tchaikovsky and his patron glimpse each other from a distance as she passes through a wood in her carriage. In real life their paths accidentally crossed in an Italian park. Later, his wife Nina loses her mind and is placed in an insane asylum; in reality she was not institutionalised until after his death.\n\n[[Glenda Jackson]] and [[Andrew Faulds]] later served together as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] from 1992 to 1997, while the screenwriter Melvyn Bragg has been a Labour member of the [[House of Lords of the United Kingdom|House of Lords]] since 1998.\n==Soundtrack==\nThe [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by Andr\u00e9 Previn, performs excerpts from the following pieces by Tchaikovsky:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto in B-flat minor]] (soloist [[Rafael Orozco (pianist)|Rafael Orozco]])\n* ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (soprano [[April Cantelo]])\n* [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6 in B minor, ''Path\u00e9tique'']]\n* ''[[Manfred Symphony]]''\n* ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet]]''\n* ''[[1812 Overture]]''\n* [[Hamlet (Tchaikovsky)|Incidental music to ''Hamlet'']]\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 5 in E minor]]\n* [[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 4 in F minor]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Globalize|article|North America|date=December 2010}}\nThe film received mostly bad reviews when it was released in the United States, but elsewhere has since become somewhat of a [[cult movie]].

In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019.

The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a [[vampire]]. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient [[Humanoid|humanoids]] of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to [[Cairo]] to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the [[serial killer]], Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The plot of the series is divided into eight [[Story arc|story arcs]], each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a [[vampire]]. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient [[Humanoid|humanoids]] of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to [[Cairo]] to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

He is most known as portrayed by actor [[Richard Dean Anderson]], who played O'Neill in all the ''Stargate'' media since 1997, when he took over the role from actor [[Kurt Russell]], who portrayed the character in the [[Stargate (film)|original ''Stargate'' film]] in 1994. O'Neill and [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] are the only two characters to appear in both the original film and all 3 ''Stargate'' television series.\n\nIn his first appearance in the 1994 film as Colonel '''Jack O'Neil''', the character leads the first team to go through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] on a reconnaissance mission. He subsequently becomes the main character of the television series ''Stargate SG-1'' created in 1997 as a sequel to the movie. In the first seven seasons of the show, Colonel Jack O'Neill, recalled from retirement after the first film, is the leader of the team SG-1, a part of the [[Stargate Program]], whose goal is to explore the galaxy and defend against any & all alien threats.\n\nThe character became less prominent in the [[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)|eighth season]] in which he is promoted to Commanding Officer of [[Stargate Command]], at the rank of [[Brigadier General]], therefore greatly reducing the character's time spent exploring via the Stargate. Anderson chose to reduce his character's status to spend more time with his family, eventually leaving the show at the start of its [[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)|ninth season]] and only appearing four times until the [[Unending|end of the series]] in its [[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|tenth and final season]]. The character's absence from the show was explained by yet another promotion, to the position of head of the Department of Homeworld Security, at the rank of [[Major General]].\n\nAnderson reprised his role once again in the direct-to-DVD film ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'', acting as a sequel to the TV series. O'Neill also appeared in the two other ''Stargate'' television series: he was an occasional character in the first three seasons of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', serving as an Earth contact with [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], this running parallel with Stargate SG-1 for a time and in four episodes of ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', appearing at the rank of [[Lieutenant General]], once again having been promoted, sometime after both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" had ended. (His appearance in this show's [[Stargate Universe (season 1)|first season]] finale being his last appearance in the ''Stargate'' universe to date). Anderson also voiced the character in the video game ''[[Stargate SG-1: Unleashed]]''.\n\n==Character arc==\nJack O'Neill is a [[United States Air Force]] colonel with experience in special operations before joining the [[Stargate Program]].<ref name=\"thegamekeeper\">{{cite episode| title=The Gamekeeper | series= Stargate SG-1 |credits = [[Jonathan Glassner]]is  and [[Brad Wright]] (is) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 2 | number = 4}}</ref> He then joins a suicidal mission through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] with a couple of airmen and Dr. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] who deciphers the Stargate.

He is most known as portrayed by actor [[Richard Dean Anderson]], who played O'Neill in all the ''Stargate'' media since 1997, when he took over the role from actor [[Kurt Russell]], who portrayed the character in the [[Stargate (film)|original ''Stargate'' film]] in 1994. O'Neill and [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] are the only two characters to appear in both the original film and all 3 ''Stargate'' television series.\n\nIn his first appearance in the 1994 film as Colonel '''Jack O'Neil''', the character leads the first team to go through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] on a reconnaissance mission. He subsequently becomes the main character of the television series ''Stargate SG-1'' created in 1997 as a sequel to the movie. In the first seven seasons of the show, Colonel Jack O'Neill, recalled from retirement after the first film, is the leader of the team SG-1, a part of the [[Stargate Program]], whose goal is to explore the galaxy and defend against any & all alien threats.\n\nThe character became less prominent in the [[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)|eighth season]] in which he is promoted to Commanding Officer of [[Stargate Command]], at the rank of [[Brigadier General]], therefore greatly reducing the character's time spent exploring via the Stargate. Anderson chose to reduce his character's status to spend more time with his family, eventually leaving the show at the start of its [[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)|ninth season]] and only appearing four times until the [[Unending|end of the series]] in its [[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|tenth and final season]]. The character's absence from the show was explained by yet another promotion, to the position of head of the Department of Homeworld Security, at the rank of [[Major General]].\n\nAnderson reprised his role once again in the direct-to-DVD film ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'', acting as a sequel to the TV series. O'Neill also appeared in the two other ''Stargate'' television series: he was an occasional character in the first three seasons of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', serving as an Earth contact with [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], this running parallel with Stargate SG-1 for a time and in four episodes of ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', appearing at the rank of [[Lieutenant General]], once again having been promoted, sometime after both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" had ended. (His appearance in this show's [[Stargate Universe (season 1)|first season]] finale being his last appearance in the ''Stargate'' universe to date). Anderson also voiced the character in the video game ''[[Stargate SG-1: Unleashed]]''.\n\n==Character arc==\nJack O'Neill is a [[United States Air Force]] colonel with experience in special operations before joining the [[Stargate Program]].<ref name=\"thegamekeeper\">{{cite episode| title=The Gamekeeper | series= Stargate SG-1 |credits = [[Jonathan Glassner]]is  and [[Brad Wright]] (is) | network = [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] | season = 2 | number = 4}}</ref> He then joins a suicidal mission through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] with a couple of airmen and Dr. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] who deciphers the Stargate.

The beating nearly killed Sumner and it contributed significantly to the country's polarization over the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]].

The long speech argued for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state and went on to denounce the \"[[Slave Power]]\"\u2014the political arm of the slave owners:\n\n{{quote|Not in any common lust for power did this uncommon tragedy have its origin.

Douglas]] of Illinois and [[Andrew Butler]] of South Carolina, saying,\n{{quote|The senator from South Carolina has read many books of chivalry and believes himself a chivalrous knight with sentiments of honor and courage.

According to Hoffer (2010), \"It is also important to note the sexual imagery that recurred throughout the (Sumner's) oration, which was neither accidental nor without precedent.

He later said that he intended to challenge Sumner to a [[duel]], and consulted with fellow South Carolina Representative [[Laurence M. Keitt]] on dueling etiquette. Keitt told him that dueling was for gentlemen of equal social standing, and that Sumner was no better than a drunkard, due to the supposedly coarse language he had used during his speech. Brooks said that he concluded that since Sumner was no gentleman, he did not merit honorable treatment; to Keitt and Brooks, it was more appropriate to humiliate Sumner by beating him with a cane in a public setting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Daigh |first=Michael |date=2015 |title=John Brown in Memory and Myth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkLoCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA113 |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland & Company |page=113 |isbn=978-0-7864-9617-4 |via= Google Books }}</ref>\n\n==Day of the attack==\n[[File:Laurence M.

It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine,\" Brooks calmly announced in a low voice.  As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks beat Sumner severely on the head before he could reach his feet, using a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head. The force of the blows so shocked Sumner that he lost his sight immediately. \"I no longer saw my assailant, nor any other person or object in the room. What I did afterwards was done almost unconsciously, acting under the instincts of self-defense,\" he recalled later.<ref>{{cite book |last= Green |first=Michael S. |date=2010 |title=Politics and America in Crisis: The Coming of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x80_kiWmx58C&pg=PA94 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=94 |isbn=978-0-313-08174-3 |via= Google Books }}</ref>\n\n[[File:HenryAEdmundson.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Congressman Henry A.

His chair, which was pulled up to his desk, moved back and forth on a track; Sumner either could not or did not think to slide his chair back to escape, so it pinned him under his desk.

He staggered up the aisle and, arms outstretched, vainly attempted to defend himself. But then he was an even larger and easier target for Brooks, who continued to beat him across the head, face, and shoulders \"to the full extent of [my] power.\" Brooks didn't stop when his cane snapped; he continued thrashing Sumner with the piece which held the gold head. Sumner stumbled and reeled convulsively, \"Oh Lord,\" he gasped \"Oh! Oh!\" Near the end of the attack, Sumner collapsed unconscious, although shortly before he succumbed he \"bellowed like a calf\" according to Brooks.

As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks beat Sumner severely on the head before he could reach his feet, using a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head.

Their songs are characterized by a blend of instrumental music and [[sound effect]]s and are commonly used to provide atmosphere during the [[Halloween]] season, in [[haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attractions]], theme parks, and in the [[role-playing game]] industry.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1996\u20131998)===\n[[Composer]]/[[filmmaker]] Edward Douglas formed Midnight Syndicate in 1996 shortly after releasing a [[low-budget film|micro-budget]], [[direct-to-video]] horror film called ''The Dead Matter (1996)''<ref>[http://www.fearnet.com/news/b13590_Musical_Horrors_Incarnate__Midnight_Syndicate_s_THE_DEAD_MATTER.html?intcid=search_articles_midnight-syndicate Interview with Edward Douglas], ''FEARnet'', October 2008.</ref> which he directed and scored and would later remake.<ref>Michael Gingold, \"The Dead Matter: From Midnight music to a movie\", ''[[Fangoria Magazine]]'' (New York, NY), August, 2010, Pg.6.</ref>  Midnight Syndicate's self-titled debut album was released the following year.<ref>[http://cocatalog.loc.gov US Copyright office] ''Midnight Syndicate'' album \u00a9 date 1997-09-17</ref>  A majority of music on the album was written, arranged, and performed by Edward Douglas. Contributors included Scott Angus, Mark Rakocy, Dennis Carleton, Jamie Barbour, Ray Portler, the rap act Dark Side, and [[Christopher Robichaud]].  Douglas coined the term ''cine-fusion'' to describe the album. ''Cine-fusion'' is described in the album's liner notes as\n:\"a blending of [[film score|movie soundtrack music]] and [[pop music]]&nbsp;... a compilation of soundtracks to movies that do not exist.  The goal of the music is to stimulate the imaginations of listeners so that they are able to transport themselves to worlds or movies of their own creation.\"\nMusically, the album contained an eclectic blend of styles including everything from dark instrumental music (of which three tracks appeared on future releases), [[Rock music|rock]],<ref name=\"music extreme\">[http://www.musicextreme.com/midnight.htm Interview with Gavin Goszka], Federico Marongiu, \"Midnight Syndicate\", ''Music Extreme'' (Argentina), 2001.</ref> [[Rock-a-Billy|rock-a-billy]], [[techno music|techno]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[New-age music|new-age]], [[Black comedy#Musicians|humor-pop]], [[jazz]], and [[Space music|space]]. Movie-style [[sound effects]] were employed in some tracks. In March 1998, a [[multimedia|multimedia show]] was produced by Douglas and his company, Entity Productions, to support the album. The show included a blending of original short films, live music, animation, and stage performers.<ref>Charles Cassady, \"On Fright Night and Beyond the Spookiest Sounds\", ''West Life'', October 25, 2006, Pg.11B.</ref>\n\n===Breakout (1998\u20132000)===\nIn 1998, Douglas teamed up with gothic fantasy artist Joseph Vargo, and the two decided to create an exclusively dark-themed instrumental Midnight Syndicate album, \"the result of Joseph Vargo's desire to produce an album that people could play in the background of their Halloween parties.\" Vargo developed the storyline and concept of a musical journey through a haunted castle, with the music reflecting his gothic artwork, \"in addition to being integral to many of the creative decisions on the album.\" <ref name=\"entity\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.entityprod.com/linfaldia.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980703070255/http://www.entityprod.com/linfaldia.htm |archive-date=1998-07-03 |url-status=bot: unknown }} Announcement posted by Midnight Syndicate in August 1998.</ref><ref name=\"radio\">[http://www.goear.com/listen.php?v=5811b41 Radio Interview with Joseph Vargo, Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221022533/http://www.goear.com/listen.php?v=5811b41 |date=2009-02-21 }} Station WERE 1300, (Cleveland, OH.), October 1998.</ref><ref name=\"Interview with Edward Douglas\">[http://www.midnightsyndicate.com/paragonintvwms1006.htm Interview with Edward Douglas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050002/http://www.midnightsyndicate.com/paragonintvwms1006.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, '' Paragon Magazine'', October 2003.</ref><ref name=\"HA\">[http://www.hauntedattraction.com/the-magazine/issues/haunted-attraction-magazine-issue-44-2/ Cover story on Midnight Syndicate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215064119/http://www.hauntedattraction.com/the-magazine/issues/haunted-attraction-magazine-issue-44-2/ |date=2011-02-15 }} Leonard Pickel, \"Midnight Syndicate: Setting the Mood for an Industry\", ''Haunted Attraction Magazine'' (Charlotte, NC), June 2006, Pg. 24-28, 38-41</ref> Composer Gavin Goszka, formerly a solo artist in a project called ''Lore,'' also joined Douglas and Vargo in the new Midnight Syndicate line-up. Together, they created ''[[Born of the Night]]'', a groundbreaking album that appealed to fans of gothic music, the horror genre, and haunted attractions. Douglas and Goszka wrote and performed the music on the album while Vargo served as [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] and [[creative director]] of the project, as well as writing and performing the vocals and narrations, and designing the cover art and packaging. The album and songs were also titled after several of Vargo's most popular paintings. ''[[Born of the Night]]'' was independently released in September 1998 through Vargo's Monolith Graphics and Douglas' Entity Productions, hitting the horror market just in time for the Halloween season. It was Midnight Syndicate's first critically acclaimed gothic-horror soundtrack and proved to be an instant success,<ref>John Soeder, \"Gothic Horror Rock Featured This Weekend\", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (Cleveland, OH), March 2, 2000.</ref> establishing Midnight Syndicate's trademark sound.\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Realm of Shadows]]'' followed suit with the same flavor of dark instrumental music and another gothic setting. Douglas and Goszka wrote all of the music for this album while Vargo wrote and performed the opening narration and theme story. Again, the songs were titled after Vargo's artworks. Both albums were featured as official soundtracks for Universal Studios' ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', and used in several other major theme parks during Halloween, such as [[Busch Gardens]], [[Cedar Point]] and [[Thorpe Park|Thorpe Park's]] ''Fright Nights'' event.<ref name=scene99>Jeff Niesel, \"Soundbites\", ''[http://www.clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html Scene Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050117183008/http://clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html |date=2005-01-17 }}'' (Cleveland, OH), October 14, 1999.</ref> The heavy metal band [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] also featured tracks from ''[[Born of the Night]]'' as opening music for their 2000 US tour.

This time Douglas and Goszka teamed up with two members who worked on the first ''[[Midnight Syndicate (album)|Midnight Syndicate]]'' CD, Mark Rakocy (graphic design) and Christopher Robichaud (vocals).   Set in a Victorian haunted [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental institution]] called Haverghast Asylum, ''[[Gates of Delirium]]'' was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature the fictitious Haverghast family,<ref name=\"music extreme\" /> a theme the band would revisit on future discs such as ''[[The 13th Hour]]''.  Gavin Goszka has since called ''[[Gates of Delirium]]'' \"a personal favorite\" from the Midnight Syndicate library.\n\nDuring the 2001 Halloween weekend, six of the band's mp3 singles were in the Top 20 for all of MP3.com (#1, No.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;7, No.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp;12, and No.&nbsp;19) registering over 100,000 listens in three days. The title track from ''[[Born of the Night]]'' remained at No.&nbsp;1 for over a week with two tracks from ''[[Gates of Delirium]]'' maintaining their positions in the Top 40 as well.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020325141944/http://www.midnightsyndicate.com/news.htm Midnight Syndicate News]</ref>\n\nIn August 2002, the band released their fifth studio album ''[[Vampyre (album)|Vampyre]]''.  The [[vampire]]-themed disc was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature a cover designed by fantasy artist [[Keith Parkinson]].\n\nBy this time, the band's popularity with [[role-playing game]]rs who used their discs as background for their sessions had grown to where they were exhibiting at [[game convention|gaming conventions]].  It was at one of these conventions that the band was approached by designers from [[Wizards of the Coast]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.uttertrash.net/index.html|title= Welcome|accessdate=2007-09-23 |publisher= Utter Trash}}</ref> The result was 2003's ''[[Dungeons & Dragons (album)|Dungeons & Dragons: Official Role-playing Soundtrack]]'', the first officially licensed soundtrack to the classic roleplaying game [[Dungeons & Dragons|of the same name]].

Contributors included Scott Angus, Mark Rakocy, Dennis Carleton, Jamie Barbour, Ray Portler, the rap act Dark Side, and [[Christopher Robichaud]].  Douglas coined the term ''cine-fusion'' to describe the album. ''Cine-fusion'' is described in the album's liner notes as\n:\"a blending of [[film score|movie soundtrack music]] and [[pop music]]&nbsp;... a compilation of soundtracks to movies that do not exist.  The goal of the music is to stimulate the imaginations of listeners so that they are able to transport themselves to worlds or movies of their own creation.\"\nMusically, the album contained an eclectic blend of styles including everything from dark instrumental music (of which three tracks appeared on future releases), [[Rock music|rock]],<ref name=\"music extreme\">[http://www.musicextreme.com/midnight.htm Interview with Gavin Goszka], Federico Marongiu, \"Midnight Syndicate\", ''Music Extreme'' (Argentina), 2001.</ref> [[Rock-a-Billy|rock-a-billy]], [[techno music|techno]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[New-age music|new-age]], [[Black comedy#Musicians|humor-pop]], [[jazz]], and [[Space music|space]].

Together, they created ''[[Born of the Night]]'', a groundbreaking album that appealed to fans of gothic music, the horror genre, and haunted attractions. Douglas and Goszka wrote and performed the music on the album while Vargo served as [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] and [[creative director]] of the project, as well as writing and performing the vocals and narrations, and designing the cover art and packaging. The album and songs were also titled after several of Vargo's most popular paintings. ''[[Born of the Night]]'' was independently released in September 1998 through Vargo's Monolith Graphics and Douglas' Entity Productions, hitting the horror market just in time for the Halloween season. It was Midnight Syndicate's first critically acclaimed gothic-horror soundtrack and proved to be an instant success,<ref>John Soeder, \"Gothic Horror Rock Featured This Weekend\", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (Cleveland, OH), March 2, 2000.</ref> establishing Midnight Syndicate's trademark sound.\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Realm of Shadows]]'' followed suit with the same flavor of dark instrumental music and another gothic setting. Douglas and Goszka wrote all of the music for this album while Vargo wrote and performed the opening narration and theme story. Again, the songs were titled after Vargo's artworks. Both albums were featured as official soundtracks for Universal Studios' ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', and used in several other major theme parks during Halloween, such as [[Busch Gardens]], [[Cedar Point]] and [[Thorpe Park|Thorpe Park's]] ''Fright Nights'' event.<ref name=scene99>Jeff Niesel, \"Soundbites\", ''[http://www.clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html Scene Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050117183008/http://clevescene.com/issues/1999-10-14/music/soundbites.html |date=2005-01-17 }}'' (Cleveland, OH), October 14, 1999.</ref> The heavy metal band [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] also featured tracks from ''[[Born of the Night]]'' as opening music for their 2000 US tour.

This time Douglas and Goszka teamed up with two members who worked on the first ''[[Midnight Syndicate (album)|Midnight Syndicate]]'' CD, Mark Rakocy (graphic design) and Christopher Robichaud (vocals).   Set in a Victorian haunted [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental institution]] called Haverghast Asylum, ''[[Gates of Delirium]]'' was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature the fictitious Haverghast family,<ref name=\"music extreme\" /> a theme the band would revisit on future discs such as ''[[The 13th Hour]]''.

The [[vampire]]-themed disc was the first Midnight Syndicate disc to feature a cover designed by fantasy artist [[Keith Parkinson]].\n\nBy this time, the band's popularity with [[role-playing game]]rs who used their discs as background for their sessions had grown to where they were exhibiting at [[game convention|gaming conventions]].

His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to study the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work. There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.<ref name=\"Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99\">''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67\u201399</ref> An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments.

This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431.<ref>Penny Edwards (2007).''Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation, 1860\u20131945'' {{ISBN|978-0-8248-2923-0}}</ref> \n\nBy 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex.

By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of [[sandstone]] (rather than brick or [[laterite]]) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts.

According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple \"attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style.\"<ref>Glaize p. 25.</ref>\n\nArchitecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the [[Ogive|ogival]], redented towers shaped like [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds; half-[[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes.

His reports inspired the French government, already an established presence in Indochina, to study the ruins. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together from stylistic and [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] evidence accumulated during subsequent clearing and restoration work.  There were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead there is only the evidence of the monuments themselves.<ref name=\"Southeast Asia 1995 p. 67-99\">''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Southeast Asia: A Past Regained'' (1995). pp. 67\u201399</ref> An exploration commission began drawing up a list of principal monuments. Subsequent missions copied inscriptions written on Angkor buildings so scholars might translate them and learn something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had worked up a chronology of the rulers and developed the outlines of a description of the civilization that had produced the temple complex. In 1898 the French decided to commit substantial funds to Angkor's preservation. Centuries of neglect had permitted the jungle to recapture many of the more significant structures, and unless efforts were made to free the buildings from the embrace of huge banyan and silk-cotton trees, they might soon be crushed to destruction.\n\n[[File:Expo 1931 Angkor nuit.jpg|thumb|left|The grand replica of Angkor Wat in Paris Colonial Exposition 1931, represent the immense grandeur of French colony; the [[French protectorate of Cambodia]].]]\nThe 20th century saw considerable restoration of Angkor Wat.<ref name=\"multiref1\">Glaize p. 59.</ref> Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun once again to illuminate the dark corners of the temple.

This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431.<ref>Penny Edwards (2007).''Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation, 1860\u20131945'' {{ISBN|978-0-8248-2923-0}}</ref> Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as [[UNESCO World Heritage]] in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.<ref>Falser, Michael: Clearing the Path towards Civilization \u2013 150 Years of \"Saving Angkor\".

By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of [[sandstone]] (rather than brick or [[laterite]]) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural [[resin]]s or [[slaked lime]] has been suggested.<ref>[http://www.gacp-angkor.de/ German Apsara Conservation Project] Building Techniques, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple \"attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity and style.\"<ref>Glaize p. 25.</ref>\n\nArchitecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the [[Ogive|ogival]], redented towers shaped like [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] buds; half-[[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas (or apsaras)]], [[bas-relief]]s, and on [[pediment]]s extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work.<ref>APSARA authority, [http://www.autoriteapsara.org/en/angkor/art/styles/angkorian/angkor_vat.html Angkor Vat Style]</ref> Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including [[gilding|gilded]] [[stucco]] on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.<ref>Freeman and Jacques p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Features===\n\n====Outer enclosure====\n[[File:Buddhist Monk at Angkor Wat 1.jpg|thumb|left|View of the gates and west wall of the outer enclosure of Angkor Wat from accross the moat]]\nThe outer wall, {{convert|1024|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|802|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, is surrounded by a {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} apron of open ground and a moat {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and over 5 kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) in perimeter.<ref name=Jarus2018 /> The moat extends 1.5 kilometres from east to west and 1.3 kilometres from north to south.<ref name=\"Angkor Wat: An Introduction\">{{cite journal |last1=Fletcher |first=Roland |first2=Damian |last2=Evans |first3=Christophe |last3=Pottier |first4=Chhay |last4=Rachna |title=Angkor Wat: An introduction |journal=Antiquity |date=December 2015 |volume=89 |issue=348 |page=1395 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2015.178 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286412358_Angkor_Wat_An_introduction |access-date=March 27, 2020 |via=ResearchGate}}</ref> Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge.<ref name=\"multiref4\">Freeman and Jacques p. 49.</ref> There are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gopura|gopuras]] at each of the [[cardinal point]]s; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers.

These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]], including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.\n\n[[File:Angkor Wat 005.jpg|thumb|right|Northern library]]\nThe outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets.<ref name=\"Freeman and Jacques p. 50\">Freeman and Jacques p. 50.</ref> Most of the area is now covered by forest. A {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with [[Architecture of Cambodia#Naga|naga]] balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|library]] with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.<ref name=\"Freeman and Jacques p. 50\"/>\n\n====Central structure====\n[[File:Angot war.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the central structure; in front of the central structure lies the cruciform terrace.]]\nThe temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular [[Architecture of Cambodia#Gallery|galleries]] rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, [[Brahma]], the moon, and [[Vishnu]].<ref name=\"Ohio\" /> Each gallery has a [[gopura]] at each of the points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a [[Architecture of Cambodia#Quincunx|quincunx]] with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer =\n| align = right\n| image1 = Angkor Wat Tempel 34.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The central tower symbolizes the sacred [[Mount Meru]].\n| link1 =\n| image2 = Awatcornertower01.JPG\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =One of the four corner towers of Angkor Wat\n| link2 =\n}}\n\nThe outer gallery measures {{convert|187|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|215|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called ''Preah Poan'' (the \"Hall of a Thousand Gods\"). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] but others in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water.<ref>Glaize p. 63.</ref> North and south of the cloister are [[Architecture of Cambodia#Library|libraries]].\n\n[[File:Angkor (IV).jpg|thumb|left|View of the outer gallery of Angkor Wat]]\nBeyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, [[Architecture of Cambodia#Apsara and devata|devatas]] abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and may originally have been flooded to represent the [[ocean]] around [[Mount Meru]].<ref>Ray, ''Lonely Planet guide to Cambodia'' p. 195.</ref> Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods.<ref>Ray p. 199.</ref> This inner gallery, called the ''Bakan'', is a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers. The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or [[garuda]]s. Carved [[Architecture of Cambodia#Lintels and pediments|lintels and pediments]] decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines.\nThe tower above the central shrine rises {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} to a height of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four.<ref>Briggs p. 199.</ref> The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to [[Theravada Buddhism]], the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouv\u00e9 excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of [[gold leaf]] two metres above ground level.<ref>Glaize p. 65.</ref>\n\n====Decoration====\n[[File:Angkor Wat - 047 Apsaras (8581709930).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devatas]] are characteristic of the Angkor Wat style.]]\nIntegrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of [[bas-relief]] friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. Higham has called these, \"the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving\".<ref>Higham, ''Early Cultures of Mainland Southeast Asia'' p. 318.</ref> From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which [[Rama]] defeats [[Ravana]]) and the [[Kurukshetra War|Battle of Kurukshetra]] (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the [[Kaurava]] and [[Pandava]] clans).

The blocks were held together by [[mortise and tenon]] joints in some cases, while in others they used dovetails and gravity. The blocks were presumably put in place by a combination of elephants, [[coir]] ropes, pulleys and [[bamboo scaffolding]]. Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep, with more holes on the larger blocks.

In 1947, the song was published under the title \"'''We Will Overcome'''\" in an edition of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' (a publication of [[People's Songs]], an organization of which [[Pete Seeger]] was the director), as a contribution of and with an introduction by [[Zilphia Horton]], then-music director of the [[Highlander Folk School]] of Monteagle, Tennessee (an adult education school that trained union organizers). Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger,<ref name=\"seegar-biography\">{{cite book|last1=Seeger|first1=Pete|title=Where Have All The Flowers Gone \u2013 A Musical Autobiography|date=1997|publisher=Sing Out|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=1881322106}}</ref> who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activisthhjbbd singers, such as [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]] and [[Joe Glazer]], who recorded it in 1950.\n\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when [[Guy Carawan]] stepped in with his and Seeger's version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on [[nonviolent]] civil rights activism. It quickly became the movement's unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as [[Joan Baez]], sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the [[Northern United States|North]] and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. [[copyright]] of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' issue which contained \"We Will Overcome\" expired in 1976, but [[The Richmond Organization]] asserted a copyright on the \"We Shall Overcome\" lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of [[copyfraud|false copyright claims]], a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the \"We Will Overcome\" lyrics that had fallen into the [[public domain]] because of [[copyright renewal|non-renewal]]. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song.\n\n==Origins as a gospel, folk, and labor song==\n\"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a hymn or [[gospel music]] composition by the Reverend [[Charles Albert Tindley]] of [[Philadelphia]] that was first published in 1900.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/NSoG1900/27 |title=New Songs of the Gospel |chapter=I'll Overcome Some Day |first=C.

The published text bore the epigraph, \"Ye shall overcome if ye faint not\", derived from [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:9: \"And let us not be weary in doing good, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\" The first stanza began:\n\n{{poemquote|The world is one great battlefield,\nWith forces all arrayed;\nIf in my heart I do not yield,\nI'll overcome some day.}}\n\nTindley's songs were written in an idiom rooted in [[African-American culture|African American folk traditions]], using pentatonic intervals, with ample space allowed for improvised interpolation, the addition of \"blue\" thirds and sevenths, and frequently featuring short refrains in which the congregation could join.<ref>Horace Clarence Boyer, \"Charles Albert Tindley: Progenitor of Black-American Gospel Music\", ''The Black Perspective in Music'' 11: No. 2 (Autumn, 1983), pp. 103\u2013132.</ref> Tindley's importance, however, was primarily as a lyricist and poet whose words spoke directly to the feelings of his audiences, many of whom had been freed from [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] only 36 years before he first published his songs, and were often impoverished, illiterate, and newly arrived in the North.<ref>Boyer, [1983], p. 113. \"Tindley was a composer for whom the lyrics constituted its major element; while the melody and  were handled with care, these elements were regarded as subservient to the text.\"</ref> \"Even today,\" wrote musicologist Horace Boyer in 1983, \"ministers quote his texts in the midst of their sermons as if they were poems, as indeed they are.\"<ref>Boyer (1983), p. 113.</ref>\n\nA letter printed on the front page of the February 1909, ''United Mine Workers Journal'' states: \"Last year at a strike, we opened every meeting with a prayer, and singing that good old song, 'We Will Overcome'.\" This statement implied that the song was well-known, and it was also the first acknowledgement of such a song having been sung in both a secular context and a mixed-race setting.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/><ref name=\"ars-overcomesuit\">{{cite web|title=Lawyers who won Happy Birthday copyright case sue over \"We Shall Overcome\"|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/lawyers-who-won-happy-birthday-copyright-case-sue-over-we-shall-overcome/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref><ref>The United Mine Workers was racially integrated from its founding and was notable for having a large black presence, particularly in Alabama and West Virginia.

The tune has been changed so that it now echoes the opening and closing melody of \"No More Auction Block For Me\",<ref>James Fuld tentatively attributes the change to the version by Atron Twigg and Kenneth Morris. See James J. Fuld, ''The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk'' (noted by Wallace and Wallechinsky)1966; New York: Dover, 1995). According to [[Alan Lomax]]'s ''The Folk Songs of North America'', \"No More Auction Block For Me\" originated in [[Canada]] and it was sung by former slaves who fled there after [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Britain abolished slavery in 1833]].</ref> also known from its refrain as \"Many Thousands Gone\".<ref>Eileen Southern, ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'', Second Edition (Norton, 1971): 546-47, 159-60.</ref> This was number 35 in [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]]'s collection of Negro Spirituals that appeared in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' of  June 1867, with a comment by Higginson reflecting on how such songs were composed (i.e., whether the work of a single author or through what used to be called \"communal composition\"):\n\n{{quote|Even of this last composition, however, we have only the approximate date and know nothing of the mode of composition. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] says of the ''Scots Songs'', that, no matter who made them, they were soon attributed to the minister of the parish whence they sprang. And I always wondered, about these, whether they had always a conscious and definite origin in some leading mind, or whether they grew by gradual accretion, in an almost unconscious way. On this point I could get no information, though I asked many questions, until at last, one day when I was being rowed across from Beaufort to Ladies' Island, I found myself, with delight, on the actual trail of a song. One of the oarsmen, a brisk young fellow, not a soldier, on being asked for his theory of the matter, dropped out a coy confession. \"Some good spirituals,\" he said, \"are start jess out o' curiosity. I been a-raise a sing, myself, once.\"\n\nMy dream was fulfilled, and I had traced out, not the poem alone, but the poet. I implored him to proceed.\n\n\"Once we boys,\" he said, \"went for to tote some rice, and de nigger-driver, he keep a-callin' on us; and I say, 'O, de ole nigger-driver!'

To keep up their spirits during the cold, wet winter of 1945\u20131946, one of the strikers, a woman named Lucille Simmons, led a slow \"long meter style\" version of the gospel hymn, \"We'll Overcome (I'll Be All Right)\" to end each day's picketing. Union organizer [[Zilphia Horton]], who was the wife of the co-founder of the [[Highlander Folk School]] (later Highlander Research and Education Center), said she learned it from Simmons. Horton was Highlander's music director during 1935\u20131956, and it became her custom to end group meetings each evening by leading this, her favorite song. During the presidential campaign of [[Henry A. Wallace]], \"We Will Overcome\" was printed in ''Bulletin No. 3'' (September 1948), 8, of [[People's Songs]], with an introduction by Horton saying that she had learned it from the interracial FTA-CIO workers and had found it to be extremely powerful. [[Pete Seeger]], a founding member of People's Songs and its director for three years, learned it from Horton's version in 1947.<ref>Dunaway, 1990, 222\u2013223; Seeger, 1993, 32; see also, Robbie Lieberman, ''My Song Is My Weapon: People's Songs, American Communism, and the Politics of Culture, 1930-50'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, [1989] 1995) p.46, p. 185</ref> Seeger writes: \"I changed it to 'We shall'... I think I liked a more open sound; 'We will' has alliteration to it, but 'We shall' opens the mouth wider; the 'i' in 'will' is not an easy vowel to sing well ....\"<ref name=\"seegar-biography\"/> Seeger also added some verses (\"We'll walk hand in hand\" and \"The whole wide world around\").\n\nIn 1950, the CIO's Department of Education and Research released the album, ''Eight New Songs for Labor'', sung by [[Joe Glazer]] (\"Labor's Troubador\"), and the Elm City Four. (Songs on the album were: \"I Ain't No Stranger Now,\" \"Too Old to Work,\" \"That's All,\" \"Humblin' Back,\" \"Shine on Me,\"  \"Great Day,\" \"The Mill Was Made of Marble,\" and \"We Will Overcome\".) During a Southern CIO drive, Glazer taught the song to country singer Texas Bill Strength, who cut a version that was later picked up by 4-Star Records.<ref>Ronald Cohen and Dave Samuelson, ''Songs for Political Action: Folkmusic, Topical Songs And the American Left 1926\u20131953'', book published as part of Bear Family Records 10-CD box set issued in Germany in 1996.</ref>\n\nThe song made its first recorded appearance as \"We Shall Overcome\" (rather than \"We Will Overcome\") in 1952 on a disc recorded by Laura Duncan (soloist) and The Jewish Young Singers (chorus), conducted by [[Robert De Cormier]], co-produced by Ernie Lieberman and [[Irwin Silber]] on Hootenany Records (Hoot 104-A) (Folkways, FN 2513, BCD15720), where it is identified as a Negro Spiritual.\n\n[[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], a folk singer from California who was a member of People's Songs and later [[The Weavers]], picked up Seeger's version. Hamilton's friend and traveling companion, fellow-Californian [[Guy Carawan]], learned the song from Hamilton. Carawan and Hamilton, accompanied by [[Ramblin Jack Elliot]], visited Highlander in the early 1950s where they also would have heard Zilphia Horton sing the song. In 1957, Seeger sang for a Highlander audience that included [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], who remarked on the way to his next stop, in [[Kentucky]], about how much the song had stuck with him. When, in 1959, Guy Carawan succeeded Horton as music director at Highlander, he reintroduced it at the school. It was the young (many of them teenagers) student-activists at Highlander, however, who gave the song the words and rhythms for which it is currently known, when they sang it to keep their spirits up during the frightening police raids on Highlander and their subsequent stays in jail in 1959\u20131960. Because of this, Carawan has been reluctant to claim credit for the song's widespread popularity. In the PBS video ''We Shall Overcome'', [[Julian Bond]] credits Carawan with teaching and singing the song at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], in 1960. From there, it spread orally and became an anthem of [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] African American [[labor union]] and civil rights activism.<ref>Dunaway, 1990, 222\u2013223; Seeger, 1993, 32.</ref> Seeger has also publicly, in concert, credited Carawan with the primary role of teaching and popularizing the song within the civil rights movement.\n\n==Use in the 1960s civil rights and other protest movements==\nIn August 1963, 22-year old folksinger [[Joan Baez]], led a crowd of 300,000 in singing \"We Shall Overcome\" at the Lincoln Memorial during [[A.

It was the struggle song of the [[Students Federation of India]] SFI, the largest student organisation in the country. The song translated to the regional language [[Malayalam]] by [[N. P. Chandrasekharan]], an activist for SFI. The translation followed the same tune of the original song, as \"''Nammal Vijayikkum''\". Later it was also published in ''[[Student (SFI newspaper)|Student]]'', the monthly of SFI in Malayalam as well as in Sarvadesheeya Ganangal (Mythri Books, Thiruvananthapuram), a translation of international struggle songs.\n\n\"We Shall Overcome\" was a prominent song in the [[Bollywood films of 2010|2010 Bollywood film]] ''[[My Name is Khan]]'', which compared the struggle of [[Muslims]] in modern [[United States|America]] with the struggles of [[African Americans]] in the past. The song was sung in both [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] in the film, which starred [[Kajol]] and [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]].\n\n==Copyright status==\nThe copyright status of \"We Shall Overcome\" was disputed in the late-2010s. A [[copyright registration]] was made for the song in 1960, which is credited as an [[Derivative work|arrangement]] by Zilphia Horton, Guy Carawan, Frank Hamilton, and Pete Seeger, of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\", with no known original author.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/> Horton's heirs, Carawan, Hamilton, and Seeger share the artists' half of the rights, and The Richmond Organization (TRO), which includes Ludlow Music, Essex, Folkways Music, and Hollis Music, holds the publishers' rights, to 50% of the royalty earnings. Seeger explained that he registered the copyright under the advice of TRO, who showed concern that someone else could register it. \"At that time we didn't know Lucille Simmons' name\", Seeger said.<ref>Seeger, 1993, p. 33</ref> Their royalties go to the \"We Shall Overcome\" Fund, administered by Highlander under the trusteeship of the \"writers\". Such funds are purportedly used to give small grants for cultural expression involving African Americans organizing in the U.S. South.<ref>''Highlander Reports'', 2004, p. 3.</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, the We Shall Overcome Foundation (WSOF), led by music producer [[Isaias Gamboa (music producer)|Isaias Gamboa]], sued TRO and Ludlow, seeking to have the copyright status of the song clarified and the return of all royalties collected by the companies from its usage. The WSOF, which was working on a documentary about the song and its history, were denied permission to use the song by TRO-Ludlow. The filing argued that TRO-Ludlow's copyright claims were invalid because the registered copyright had not been renewed as required by [[United States copyright law]] at the time; because of this, the copyright of the 1948 ''People's Songs'' publication containing \"We Will Overcome\" had expired in 1976. Additionally, it was argued that the registered copyrights only covered specific arrangements of the tune and \"obscure alternate verses\", that the registered works \"did not contain original works of authorship, except to the extent of the arrangements themselves\", and that no record of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\" existed in the database of the [[United States Copyright Office]].<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\">{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=David A. |title=Who Owns 'We Shall Overcome'? |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/we-shall-overcome-lawsuit/478068/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe suit acknowledged that Seeger himself had not claimed to be an author of the song, stating of the song in his autobiography, \"No one is certain who changed 'will' to 'shall.'

It sings better.\" He also reaffirmed that the decision to copyright the song was a defensive measure, with his publisher apparently warning him that \"if you don't copyright this now, some Hollywood types will have a version out next year like 'Come on Baby, We shall overcome tonight'\". Furthermore, the liner notes of Seeger's compilation album ''If I Had a Hammer: Songs of Hope & Struggle'' contained a summary on the purported history of the song, stating that \"We Shall Overcome\" was \"probably adapted from the 19th-century hymn, 'I'll Be All Right'\", and that \"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a \"possible source\" and may have originally been adapted from \"I'll Be All Right\".<ref name=\"suit-pdf\">{{cite web |title=WE SHALL OVERCOME FOUNDATION, C.A.

In 1947, the song was published under the title \"'''We Will Overcome'''\" in an edition of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' (a publication of [[People's Songs]], an organization of which [[Pete Seeger]] was the director), as a contribution of and with an introduction by [[Zilphia Horton]], then-music director of the [[Highlander Folk School]] of Monteagle, Tennessee (an adult education school that trained union organizers). Horton said she had learned the song from Simmons, and she considered it to be her favorite song. She taught it to many others, including Pete Seeger,<ref name=\"seegar-biography\">{{cite book|last1=Seeger|first1=Pete|title=Where Have All The Flowers Gone \u2013 A Musical Autobiography|date=1997|publisher=Sing Out|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=1881322106}}</ref> who included it in his repertoire, as did many other activist singers, such as [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]] and [[Joe Glazer]], who recorded it in 1950.\n\nThe song became associated with the civil rights movement from 1959, when [[Guy Carawan]] stepped in with his and Seeger's version as song leader at Highlander, which was then focused on [[nonviolent]] civil rights activism. It quickly became the movement's unofficial anthem. Seeger and other famous folksingers in the early 1960s, such as [[Joan Baez]], sang the song at rallies, folk festivals, and concerts in the [[Northern United States|North]] and helped make it widely known. Since its rise to prominence, the song, and songs based on it, have been used in a variety of protests worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. [[copyright]] of the ''People's Songs Bulletin'' issue which contained \"We Will Overcome\" expired in 1976, but [[The Richmond Organization]] asserted a copyright on the \"We Shall Overcome\" lyrics, registered in 1960. In 2017, in response to a lawsuit against TRO over allegations of [[copyfraud|false copyright claims]], a U.S. judge issued an opinion that the registered work was insufficiently different from the \"We Will Overcome\" lyrics that had fallen into the [[public domain]] because of [[copyright renewal|non-renewal]]. In January 2018, the company agreed to a settlement under which it would no longer assert any copyright claims over the song.\n\n==Origins as a gospel, folk, and labor song==\n\"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a hymn or [[gospel music]] composition by the Reverend [[Charles Albert Tindley]] of [[Philadelphia]] that was first published in 1900.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/NSoG1900/27 |title=New Songs of the Gospel |chapter=I'll Overcome Some Day |first=C. Albert |last=Tindley |publisher=Hall-Mack Co. |location=Philadelphia |year=1900}}</ref> A noted minister of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], Tindley was the author of approximately 50 gospel hymns, of which \"We'll Understand It By and By\" and \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand By Me]]\" are among the best known. The published text bore the epigraph, \"Ye shall overcome if ye faint not\", derived from [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:9: \"And let us not be weary in doing good, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\" The first stanza began:\n\n{{poemquote|The world is one great battlefield,\nWith forces all arrayed;\nIf in my heart I do not yield,\nI'll overcome some day.}}\n\nTindley's songs were written in an idiom rooted in [[African-American culture|African American folk traditions]], using pentatonic intervals, with ample space allowed for improvised interpolation, the addition of \"blue\" thirds and sevenths, and frequently featuring short refrains in which the congregation could join.<ref>Horace Clarence Boyer, \"Charles Albert Tindley: Progenitor of Black-American Gospel Music\", ''The Black Perspective in Music'' 11: No. 2 (Autumn, 1983), pp. 103\u2013132.</ref> Tindley's importance, however, was primarily as a lyricist and poet whose words spoke directly to the feelings of his audiences, many of whom had been freed from [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] only 36 years before he first published his songs, and were often impoverished, illiterate, and newly arrived in the North.<ref>Boyer, [1983], p. 113. \"Tindley was a composer for whom the lyrics constituted its major element; while the melody and  were handled with care, these elements were regarded as subservient to the text.\"</ref> \"Even today,\" wrote musicologist Horace Boyer in 1983, \"ministers quote his texts in the midst of their sermons as if they were poems, as indeed they are.\"<ref>Boyer (1983), p. 113.</ref>\n\nA letter printed on the front page of the February 1909, ''United Mine Workers Journal'' states: \"Last year at a strike, we opened every meeting with a prayer, and singing that good old song, 'We Will Overcome'.\" This statement implied that the song was well-known, and it was also the first acknowledgement of such a song having been sung in both a secular context and a mixed-race setting.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/><ref name=\"ars-overcomesuit\">{{cite web|title=Lawyers who won Happy Birthday copyright case sue over \"We Shall Overcome\"|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/lawyers-who-won-happy-birthday-copyright-case-sue-over-we-shall-overcome/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref><ref>The United Mine Workers was racially integrated from its founding and was notable for having a large black presence, particularly in Alabama and West Virginia.

The tune has been changed so that it now echoes the opening and closing melody of \"No More Auction Block For Me\",<ref>James Fuld tentatively attributes the change to the version by Atron Twigg and Kenneth Morris. See James J. Fuld, ''The Book of World-Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk'' (noted by Wallace and Wallechinsky)1966; New York: Dover, 1995). According to [[Alan Lomax]]'s ''The Folk Songs of North America'', \"No More Auction Block For Me\" originated in [[Canada]] and it was sung by former slaves who fled there after [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Britain abolished slavery in 1833]].</ref> also known from its refrain as \"Many Thousands Gone\".<ref>Eileen Southern, ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'', Second Edition (Norton, 1971): 546-47, 159-60.</ref> This was number 35 in [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]]'s collection of Negro Spirituals that appeared in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' of  June 1867, with a comment by Higginson reflecting on how such songs were composed (i.e., whether the work of a single author or through what used to be called \"communal composition\"):\n\n{{quote|Even of this last composition, however, we have only the approximate date and know nothing of the mode of composition. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] says of the ''Scots Songs'', that, no matter who made them, they were soon attributed to the minister of the parish whence they sprang. And I always wondered, about these, whether they had always a conscious and definite origin in some leading mind, or whether they grew by gradual accretion, in an almost unconscious way. On this point I could get no information, though I asked many questions, until at last, one day when I was being rowed across from Beaufort to Ladies' Island, I found myself, with delight, on the actual trail of a song. One of the oarsmen, a brisk young fellow, not a soldier, on being asked for his theory of the matter, dropped out a coy confession. \"Some good spirituals,\" he said, \"are start jess out o' curiosity. I been a-raise a sing, myself, once.\"\n\nMy dream was fulfilled, and I had traced out, not the poem alone, but the poet. I implored him to proceed.\n\n\"Once we boys,\" he said, \"went for to tote some rice, and de nigger-driver, he keep a-callin' on us; and I say, 'O, de ole nigger-driver!' Den another said, 'First thing my mammy told me was, notin' so bad as a nigger-driver.' Den I made a sing, just puttin' a word, and den another word.\"\n\nThen he began singing, and the men, after listening a moment, joined in the chorus as if it were an old acquaintance, though they evidently had never heard it before. I saw how easily a new \"sing\" took root among them.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Atlantic Monthly |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/1867jun/spirit.htm |title=Negro Spirituals |first=Thomas Wentworth |last=Higginson |date=June 1867 |volume=19 |number=116 |pages=685\u2013694}}</ref>}}\n\nCoincidentally, [[Bob Dylan]] claims that he used the very same melodic motif from \"No More Auction Block\" for his composition, \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\".<ref>From the sleeve notes to Bob Dylan's \"Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3\" - \"...it was Pete Seeger who first identified Dylan's adaptation of the melody of this song [\"No More Auction Block\"] for the composition of \"Blowin' in the Wind\". Indeed, Dylan himself was to admit the debt in 1978, when he told journalist Marc Rowland: \"Blowin' in the Wind\" has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called \"No More Auction Block\" - that's a spiritual, and \"Blowin' in the Wind sorta follows the same feeling...\"</ref> Thus similarities of melodic and rhythmic patterns imparted cultural and emotional resonance (\"the same feeling\") towards three different, and historically very significant songs.\n\nMusic scholars have also pointed out that the first half of \"We Shall Overcome\" bears a notable resemblance to the famous lay Catholic hymn \"[[O Sanctissima]]\", also known as \"The Sicilian Mariners Hymn\", first published by a London magazine in 1792 and then by an American magazine in 1794 and widely circulated in American hymnals.<ref name=Bobetsky>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dT_xBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA13 |title=We Shall Overcome: Essays on a Great American Song |first=Victor V. |last=Bobetsky |pages=1\u201313 |date=2015 |accessdate=October 18, 2016|isbn=9781442236035 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsMPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA342&lpg=PA386 |title=Drossiana.

To keep up their spirits during the cold, wet winter of 1945\u20131946, one of the strikers, a woman named Lucille Simmons, led a slow \"long meter style\" version of the gospel hymn, \"We'll Overcome (I'll Be All Right)\" to end each day's picketing. Union organizer [[Zilphia Horton]], who was the wife of the co-founder of the [[Highlander Folk School]] (later Highlander Research and Education Center), said she learned it from Simmons. Horton was Highlander's music director during 1935\u20131956, and it became her custom to end group meetings each evening by leading this, her favorite song. During the presidential campaign of [[Henry A. Wallace]], \"We Will Overcome\" was printed in ''Bulletin No. 3'' (September 1948), 8, of [[People's Songs]], with an introduction by Horton saying that she had learned it from the interracial FTA-CIO workers and had found it to be extremely powerful. [[Pete Seeger]], a founding member of People's Songs and its director for three years, learned it from Horton's version in 1947.<ref>Dunaway, 1990, 222\u2013223; Seeger, 1993, 32; see also, Robbie Lieberman, ''My Song Is My Weapon: People's Songs, American Communism, and the Politics of Culture, 1930-50'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, [1989] 1995) p.46, p. 185</ref> Seeger writes: \"I changed it to 'We shall'...

(Songs on the album were: \"I Ain't No Stranger Now,\" \"Too Old to Work,\" \"That's All,\" \"Humblin' Back,\" \"Shine on Me,\"  \"Great Day,\" \"The Mill Was Made of Marble,\" and \"We Will Overcome\".) During a Southern CIO drive, Glazer taught the song to country singer Texas Bill Strength, who cut a version that was later picked up by 4-Star Records.<ref>Ronald Cohen and Dave Samuelson, ''Songs for Political Action: Folkmusic, Topical Songs And the American Left 1926\u20131953'', book published as part of Bear Family Records 10-CD box set issued in Germany in 1996.</ref>\n\nThe song made its first recorded appearance as \"We Shall Overcome\" (rather than \"We Will Overcome\") in 1952 on a disc recorded by Laura Duncan (soloist) and The Jewish Young Singers (chorus), conducted by [[Robert De Cormier]], co-produced by Ernie Lieberman and [[Irwin Silber]] on Hootenany Records (Hoot 104-A) (Folkways, FN 2513, BCD15720), where it is identified as a Negro Spiritual.\n\n[[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], a folk singer from California who was a member of People's Songs and later [[The Weavers]], picked up Seeger's version. Hamilton's friend and traveling companion, fellow-Californian [[Guy Carawan]], learned the song from Hamilton. Carawan and Hamilton, accompanied by [[Ramblin Jack Elliot]], visited Highlander in the early 1950s where they also would have heard Zilphia Horton sing the song. In 1957, Seeger sang for a Highlander audience that included [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], who remarked on the way to his next stop, in [[Kentucky]], about how much the song had stuck with him. When, in 1959, Guy Carawan succeeded Horton as music director at Highlander, he reintroduced it at the school. It was the young (many of them teenagers) student-activists at Highlander, however, who gave the song the words and rhythms for which it is currently known, when they sang it to keep their spirits up during the frightening police raids on Highlander and their subsequent stays in jail in 1959\u20131960. Because of this, Carawan has been reluctant to claim credit for the song's widespread popularity. In the PBS video ''We Shall Overcome'', [[Julian Bond]] credits Carawan with teaching and singing the song at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], in 1960. From there, it spread orally and became an anthem of [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] African American [[labor union]] and civil rights activism.<ref>Dunaway, 1990, 222\u2013223; Seeger, 1993, 32.</ref> Seeger has also publicly, in concert, credited Carawan with the primary role of teaching and popularizing the song within the civil rights movement.\n\n==Use in the 1960s civil rights and other protest movements==\nIn August 1963, 22-year old folksinger [[Joan Baez]], led a crowd of 300,000 in singing \"We Shall Overcome\" at the Lincoln Memorial during [[A.

[[Bruce Springsteen]]'s re-interpretation of the song was included on the 1998 tribute album ''Where Have All the Flowers Gone: The Songs of Pete Seeger'' as well as on Springsteen's 2006 album ''[[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions]]''.\n\n==Widespread adaptation==\n\"We Shall Overcome\" was adopted by various labor, nationalist, and political movements both during and after the [[Cold War]]. In his memoir about his years teaching English in [[Czechoslovakia]] after the [[Velvet Revolution]], Mark Allen wrote:\n\n{{quote|In Prague in 1989, during the intense weeks of the Velvet Revolution, hundreds of thousands of people sang this haunting music in unison in Wenceslas Square, both in English and in Czech, with special emphasis on the phrase 'I do believe.'  This song's message of hope gave protesters strength to carry on until the powers-that-be themselves finally gave up hope themselves.\nIn the Prague of 1964, Seeger was stunned to find himself being whistled and booed by crowds of [[Czechs]] when he spoke out against the [[Vietnam War]].

It was the struggle song of the [[Students Federation of India]] SFI, the largest student organisation in the country. The song translated to the regional language [[Malayalam]] by [[N. P. Chandrasekharan]], an activist for SFI. The translation followed the same tune of the original song, as \"''Nammal Vijayikkum''\". Later it was also published in ''[[Student (SFI newspaper)|Student]]'', the monthly of SFI in Malayalam as well as in Sarvadesheeya Ganangal (Mythri Books, Thiruvananthapuram), a translation of international struggle songs.\n\n\"We Shall Overcome\" was a prominent song in the [[Bollywood films of 2010|2010 Bollywood film]] ''[[My Name is Khan]]'', which compared the struggle of [[Muslims]] in modern [[United States|America]] with the struggles of [[African Americans]] in the past. The song was sung in both [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] in the film, which starred [[Kajol]] and [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]].\n\n==Copyright status==\nThe copyright status of \"We Shall Overcome\" was disputed in the late-2010s. A [[copyright registration]] was made for the song in 1960, which is credited as an [[Derivative work|arrangement]] by Zilphia Horton, Guy Carawan, Frank Hamilton, and Pete Seeger, of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\", with no known original author.<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\"/> Horton's heirs, Carawan, Hamilton, and Seeger share the artists' half of the rights, and The Richmond Organization (TRO), which includes Ludlow Music, Essex, Folkways Music, and Hollis Music, holds the publishers' rights, to 50% of the royalty earnings. Seeger explained that he registered the copyright under the advice of TRO, who showed concern that someone else could register it. \"At that time we didn't know Lucille Simmons' name\", Seeger said.<ref>Seeger, 1993, p. 33</ref> Their royalties go to the \"We Shall Overcome\" Fund, administered by Highlander under the trusteeship of the \"writers\". Such funds are purportedly used to give small grants for cultural expression involving African Americans organizing in the U.S. South.<ref>''Highlander Reports'', 2004, p. 3.</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, the We Shall Overcome Foundation (WSOF), led by music producer [[Isaias Gamboa (music producer)|Isaias Gamboa]], sued TRO and Ludlow, seeking to have the copyright status of the song clarified and the return of all royalties collected by the companies from its usage. The WSOF, which was working on a documentary about the song and its history, were denied permission to use the song by TRO-Ludlow. The filing argued that TRO-Ludlow's copyright claims were invalid because the registered copyright had not been renewed as required by [[United States copyright law]] at the time; because of this, the copyright of the 1948 ''People's Songs'' publication containing \"We Will Overcome\" had expired in 1976. Additionally, it was argued that the registered copyrights only covered specific arrangements of the tune and \"obscure alternate verses\", that the registered works \"did not contain original works of authorship, except to the extent of the arrangements themselves\", and that no record of a work entitled \"I'll Overcome\" existed in the database of the [[United States Copyright Office]].<ref name=\"theatlantic-whoowns\">{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=David A. |title=Who Owns 'We Shall Overcome'? |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/we-shall-overcome-lawsuit/478068/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe suit acknowledged that Seeger himself had not claimed to be an author of the song, stating of the song in his autobiography, \"No one is certain who changed 'will' to 'shall.' It could have been me with my [[Harvard University|Harvard]] education. But Septima Clarke, a Charleston schoolteacher (who was director of education at Highlander and after the civil rights movement was elected year after year to the Charleston, S.C. Board of Education) always preferred 'shall.' It sings better.\" He also reaffirmed that the decision to copyright the song was a defensive measure, with his publisher apparently warning him that \"if you don't copyright this now, some Hollywood types will have a version out next year like 'Come on Baby, We shall overcome tonight'\". Furthermore, the liner notes of Seeger's compilation album ''If I Had a Hammer: Songs of Hope & Struggle'' contained a summary on the purported history of the song, stating that \"We Shall Overcome\" was \"probably adapted from the 19th-century hymn, 'I'll Be All Right'\", and that \"I'll Overcome Some Day\" was a \"possible source\" and may have originally been adapted from \"I'll Be All Right\".<ref name=\"suit-pdf\">{{cite web |title=WE SHALL OVERCOME FOUNDATION, C.A.
