The iPhone 6S also introduces a new hardware feature known as \"[[3D Touch]]\", which enables pressure-sensitive touch inputs.\n\nThe iPhone 6S had a generally positive reception. While performance and camera quality were praised by most reviewers, the addition of 3D Touch was liked by one critic for the potential of entirely new interface interactions, but disliked by another critic for not providing users with an expected intuitive response before actually using the feature. The battery life was criticized, and one reviewer asserted that the phone's camera was not significantly better than the rest of the industry. The iPhone 6S set a new first-weekend sales record, selling 13&nbsp;million models, up from 10&nbsp;million for the iPhone 6 in the previous year.

They were announced on September 9, 2015, at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]] by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]], with pre-orders beginning September 12 and official release on September 25, 2015.

The iPhone 6S also introduces a new hardware feature known as \"[[3D Touch]]\", which enables pressure-sensitive touch inputs.\n\nThe iPhone 6S had a generally positive reception. While performance and camera quality were praised by most reviewers, the addition of 3D Touch was liked by one critic for the potential of entirely new interface interactions, but disliked by another critic for not providing users with an expected intuitive response before actually using the feature. The battery life was criticized, and one reviewer asserted that the phone's camera was not significantly better than the rest of the industry. The iPhone 6S set a new first-weekend sales record, selling 13&nbsp;million models, up from 10&nbsp;million for the iPhone 6 in the previous year. However, Apple saw its first-ever quarterly year-over-year decline in iPhone sales in the months after the launch, credited to a saturated smartphone market in Apple's biggest countries and a lack of iPhone purchases in developing countries.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Iphone6S X-RAY.jpg|thumb|X-ray of the iPhone 6S]]\n[[File:IPhone_6s_rear,_Space_Gray.jpg|thumb|The Space Gray variant of an iPhone 6S showing its rear [[aluminum]] housing, identical to the [[iPhone 6]].

Ibero-American Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Springer, Cham, 2016. p. 151-162.</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAutomatic Authorship Identification (AAI) has existed for almost 120 years. [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] was the first to examine works of [[Francis Bacon]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]] aiming to detect quantitative stylistic differences using word length.<ref>Mendenhall, Thomas Corwin. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1764604 The characteristic curves of composition].\" Science (1887): 237-249.</ref> Since then, things have changed rapidly due to the development of technology.\n\nThere are three major fields in AAI: authorship attribution, author identification, and author profiling. In the first two, the goal is to recognize the author from a set of authors, while in author profiling, the goal is to find specific characteristics of the author, based on stylistic- or content-based features.<ref>Mikros, George K., and Kostas Perifanos. \"[https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS13/paper/viewPDFInterstitial/5714/5914 Authorship Attribution in Greek Tweets Using Author's Multilevel N-Gram Profiles].\" 2013 AAAI Spring Symposium Series. 2013.</ref><ref>Stamatatos, Efstathios. \"[https://www.aflat.org/~walter/educational/material/Stamatatos_survey2009.pdf A survey of modern authorship attribution methods].\" Journal of the American Society for information Science and Technology 60.3 (2009): 538-556.</ref>\n\nThe author profiling task is a yet unsolved problem, due to its difficulty. It has been studied by many researchers and, while some show great progress and good results, it still has many unexplored areas and room for improvement. Through the organizational efforts of PAN,a collaborative organization with a yearly focus in author profiling, many teams around the globe try every year to find the characteristics of authors.<ref name=\"PAN2015\">Rangel, Francisco, et al. \"[https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/836c1e/129924.pdf Overview of the 3rd Author Profiling Task at PAN 2015].\" CLEF. 2015.</ref><ref>Rangel, Francisco, et al. \"[https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/ecbc95/118297.pdf Overview of the 2nd author profiling task at pan 2014].\" CEUR Workshop Proceedings.

Different combinations of textual attributes belonging to the authors were identified and analyzed using author profiling, including [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] and [[syntactical]] features.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/> Pioneering research in author profiling focused mostly on a single genre until the shift towards author profiling on [[social media]] and the [[Internet]].<ref name=\"CAPS\">Bilan, I. & Zhekova, D.

Author profiling is done on digital texts such as texts on [[social media]], [[blog]] posts and [[emails]].<ref name=\"doi.org\"/> There is constant effort to further research on author profiling because of the advantages that it can bring to sectors such as [[crime]], [[marketing]] and [[business]].<ref name=\"ibima.org\"/> Author profiling on digital texts has enabled predictions of a wider range of author characteristics such as [[personality]],<ref name=\"ibima.org\"/> [[income]] and [[Job|occupation]].<ref>Schler, J., Koppel, M., Argamon, S., & Pennebaker, J.W.

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275</ref> As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

This is because of how a [[social network]] may be built, expanded, and used for social action in the site.<ref>Dam, J. W. V., & Velden, M. V. D. (2015). Online profiling and clustering of [[Facebook]] users. In:Decision Support Systems, 70, 60\u201372. doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2014.12.001</ref> In such processes, users share personal content that may be used for author profiling studies. Textual data is obtained from [[Facebook]] for author profiling from user\u2019s personal posts such as \u2018status updates\u2019.<ref name= \"Hsieh_et_al\">Hsieh, F.C., Sandroni, R.F., & Paraboni, I. (2018). Author Profiling from Facebook Corpora. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1407.pdf</ref> These are acquired to produce a corpus in the selected language(s) for author profiling, to create either a bilingual or multilingual database of content words,<ref name=\"Hsieh_et_al\"/><ref name=\"Fatima et al\">Fatima, M., Hasan, K., Anwar, S., & Nawab, R.

Retrieved fromhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2017.03.005</ref> which may then be used for author profiling.\n\nIn the context of [[Facebook]], author profiling involves mainly [[English language|English]] textual data, but also involves Non-english languages that include: [[Roman Urdu]], [[Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=\"Fatima et al\"/><ref name=\" Rangel\"/> While author profiling studies on [[Facebook]] have been predominantly for [[gender]] and [[ageing|age]] -group identification, there have been attempts to derive attributes to predict [[religiosity]], the IT background of users, and even basic [[emotion]] defined by [[Paul Ekman]] among others.<ref name=\"Hsieh_et_al\"/><ref name=\"Rangel & Rosso\">Rangel, F., & Rosso, P. (2013). Use of Language and Author Profiling: Identification of Gender and Age. Retrieved from http://personales.upv.es/prosso/resources/RangelRosso_NLPCS13.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Weibo ====\n\n[[Sina Weibo]] is one of the few [[social media]] platforms originating from [[asia]]n countries with predominantly [[asia]]n languages that is analysed with author profiling. Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref> In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]]. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train [[algorithm]]s that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/>\n\n====Chat Logs====\n\nChat logs have been studied for author profiling as they include much textual [[discourse]], the analysis of which have contributed to applicational studies including social trends and [[forensic science]]. Sources of data for author profiling from [[chat log]]s include platforms such as [[Yahoo!]], [[AIM (software)]] and [[WhatsApp]].<ref>Lin, J. (2007). Automatic Author Profiling of Online Chat Logs.

Important parts of the [[MIME]] (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions that contain content of the emails are also included in the crucial analysis.

(n.d.). Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef18/pan18-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Depending on its application, the task of author profiling can vary in terms of the characteristics to be identified, number of authors studied and number of texts available for analysis.\n\nAlthough its applications have traditionally been limited to written texts, such as literary works,  this has extended to online texts with the advancement of the computer and the Internet.\n\n=== Forensic Linguistics ===\nIn the context of [[forensic linguistics]], author profiling is used to identify characteristics of the author of anonymous, [[pseudonym]]ous or [[Forgery|forged]] text, based on the author\u2019s use of the language. Through linguistic analysis, forensic linguists seek to identify the suspect\u2019s motivation and ideology, along with other class features, such as the suspect\u2019s ethnicity or profession. While this does not always lead to decisive author identification, such information can help [[law enforcement]] narrow the pool of suspects.<ref>Foster, D. (2000). Author Unknown: On the Trial of Anonymous. Henry Holt and Company</ref>\n\nIn most cases, author profiling in the context of forensic linguistics involves a single text problem, in which there is either no or few comparison texts available and no external evidence that points to the author.<ref name= \"Grant 2008\">Grant, T.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest and best-known examples of the use of author profiling is by [[Roger Shuy]], who was asked to examine a ransom note linked to a notorious kidnapping case in 1979. Based on his analysis of the kidnapper\u2019s [[idiolect]], Shuy was able to identify crucial elements of the kidnappers identity from his misspellings and a dialect item, that is, the kidnapper was well-educated and from [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>Leonard, R. A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C. E. (2001). Empirical evaluations of language-based author identification techniques. Forensic Linguistics, 8, 1-65.</ref>\n\n=== Bot Detection ===\nAuthor profiling is adopted in the identification of [[social bot]]s, the most common being [[Twitter bot]]s. Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information. In the context of marketing, social bots can artificially inflate the popularity of a product by posting positive reviews, and undermine the reputation of competitive products with unfavourable reviews.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\">Bots and Gender Profiling 2019.

With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]].

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275</ref> As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M.

Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref> In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]].

Based on his analysis of the kidnapper\u2019s [[idiolect]], Shuy was able to identify crucial elements of the kidnappers identity from his misspellings and a dialect item, that is, the kidnapper was well-educated and from [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>Leonard, R. A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C. E. (2001). Empirical evaluations of language-based author identification techniques. Forensic Linguistics, 8, 1-65.</ref>\n\n=== Bot Detection ===\nAuthor profiling is adopted in the identification of [[social bot]]s, the most common being [[Twitter bot]]s. Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information. In the context of marketing, social bots can artificially inflate the popularity of a product by posting positive reviews, and undermine the reputation of competitive products with unfavourable reviews.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\">Bots and Gender Profiling 2019. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef19/pan19-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Therefore, bot detection from an author profiling perspective is a task of high importance.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\"/><ref name= \"Goubin et al Notebook\">Goubin, R\u00e9gis & Lefeuvre, Dorian & Alhamzeh, Alaa & Mitrovi\u0107, Jelena & Egyed-Zsigmond, El\u02dd & Fossi, Leopold. (2019). Bots and Gender Profiling using a Multi-layer Architecture Notebook for PAN at CLEF 2019.</ref>\n\nMade to appear as human accounts, bots can mostly be identified by information on their profiles, like their username, profile photo and time of posting.<ref name= \"Goubin et al Notebook\"/> However, the task of identifying bots solely from textual data (i.e. without meta-data) is significantly more challenging, requiring author profiling techniques.<ref name= \"Goubin et al Notebook\"/> This usually involves a classification task based on semantic and syntactic features.<ref name=\"Daelmans 2019\">Daelemans W. et al.

Author profiling techniques are helpful to business experts in making better informed strategic decisions based on the demographics of their target group.<ref>Raghunadha Reddy T., Lakshminarayana M., Vishnu Vardhan B., Sai Prasad K., Amarnath Reddy E.

Author profiling for [[literature]] is also been done to deduce the [[social network]]s of authors and their literary influence based on their bibliographic records of co-authorship.\n\nSome examples of author profiling studies on literature and traditional media include studies on the following;:<ref>Company, J. S., & Wanner, L. (2017). On the Relevance of Syntactic and Discourse Features for Author Profiling and Identification.

(2009). Classifying library catalogues by author profiling. In: Proceedings of the 32nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR 09. {{doi|10.1145/1571941.1572057}}</ref> In this approach, author profiling techniques may improve the efficiency of [[library catalog|library cataloguing]] in which library resources are automatically classified based on the authors' [[bibliographic records]]. This was a significant issue in the early 21st century when much of library cataloguing was still done manually.\n\nIn using author profiling for library cataloguing, researchers have utilised [[machine learning]] for automatic processes in the [[library]], such as [[Support Vector Machine]] [[algorithms]] (SVMs). With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]]. It features a criminal profiler who identifies defining characteristics of the Unabomber\u2019s identity based on his analysis of the Unabomber\u2019s [[idiolect]] in his letters and published manifesto.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Authorship debates]]\n[[Category:Computational fields of study]]\n", "name_user": "Rblonski", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(link added to source [10])", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author_profiling"}

Cartman is one of four central characters in ''South Park'', along with [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Kenny McCormick]]. Cartman first appeared, originally in prototypical form in a 1992 animated short ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)#Jesus vs. Frosty|Jesus vs. Frosty]]'', and a 1995 animated short ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)#Jesus vs. Santa|Jesus vs. Santa]]'', and first appeared on television in the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of ''South Park'', \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\", on August 13, 1997.\n\nCartman is an [[elementary school]] student who lives with his mother in the fictional town of South Park, [[Colorado]], where he routinely has extraordinary experiences atypical of a small town. Cartman has been portrayed as [[aggression|aggressive]], [[prejudice]]d, [[Pride|arrogant]] and [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] since his character's inception; Stone and Parker describe the character as \"a little [[Archie Bunker]]\". These traits are significantly augmented in later seasons, particularly following the episode \"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\", as his character evolves and he begins to exhibit extremely [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[Sociopathic personality disorder|sociopathic]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behavior and also be depicted as highly [[intelligence|intelligent]], able to execute morally appalling plans and business ideas to get success, but most of his plans usually end up in defeat, mainly due to something or somebody ruining his plans.\n\nCartman is considered to be the most popular and famous character on ''South Park''.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89375695 | title=Eric Cartman: America's Favorite Little $@#&*% | work=[[NPR]] | date=April 5, 2008 | accessdate=July 22, 2013 | author=Rovner, Julie}}</ref><ref name=\"am\">{{cite web | url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-cartman-moments.html | title=Top 10: Cartman Moments | work=[[AskMen]] | accessdate=July 22, 2013 | author=McKee, Ryan}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN top\"/> Parker and Stone state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify. ''South Park'' has received both praise and criticism for Cartman's [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] behavior. Prominent publications and television channels have included Cartman on their lists as one of the most iconic television and cartoon characters of all time.\n\n==Role in ''South Park''==\nEric Cartman attends South Park Elementary as part of [[Mr. Garrison]]'s class. During the show's first 58 episodes, Cartman and the other main characters are in the [[third grade]], after which they move on to the [[fourth grade]]. He is raised as an [[only child]] by [[Liane Cartman]], a promiscuous single mother. In \"[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]\" (1998), Liane Cartman is said to be a [[hermaphrodite]] and the father of Cartman who did not know the woman who gave birth to Cartman.<ref name=\"mcfarland1\">{{cite news| first = Melanie | last = McFarland| title= Oh my God, 'South Park' killed a decade!| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date= September 30, 2006|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/287052_southpark02.html| accessdate = May 9, 2009}}</ref> However, the [[South Park (season 14)|season 14]] (2010) episode \"[[201 (South Park)|201]]\" later reveals that Liane is his mother, and that his true biological father is Jack Tenorman, a fictional former player for the [[Denver Broncos]] whom Cartman arranged to be killed in the [[South Park (season 5)|season five]] (2001) episode \"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\", making Cartman and Scott Tenorman half-brothers.<ref name=\"cartmandad\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/articles/201,40382/|title=201|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|date=21 April 2010|work=The A.V.

The two have shared an enmity since the show's beginnings, and their rivalry has become significantly more pronounced as the series has progressed, with Cartman even routinely exposing Kyle to physical endangerment. For instance, in \"[[Tonsil Trouble]],\" Cartman deliberately infected Kyle with [[HIV]].<ref name=\"growsup2\"/><ref name=\"AIDS\">{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/859/859352p1.html|title=\"Tonsil Trouble\" Review|website=IGN|accessdate=Oct 12, 2009}}</ref> Kyle has intentionally endangered Cartman as well by convincing him in \"[[Fatbeard]]\" to go to [[Somalia]] in hopes that he will be killed. Their rivalry stems from opposition in personalities. Where Kyle is restrained by firm morals, Cartman would rather indulge in pleasure, and goes out of his way to hurt others.\n\nHowever, Kyle is sometimes an enthusiastic participant in Cartman's schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen treating Kyle well, although this is generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal, or for manipulation.<ref>e.g. ''[[Wing (South Park)]]'', ''[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]''</ref> Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by [[Archie Bunker]] and [[Michael Stivic|Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic]] on the 1970s [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]''. Kyle has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation in this regard is not merely monetary gain, but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode \"[[Imaginationland: The Movie|Imaginationland]]\" ([[South Park (season 11)|season 11]], 2007).<ref name=\"growsup2\"/> This obsession has also proven itself to trump other goals Cartman wishes to achieve, for instance, in \"[[Christian Rock Hard]]\" Cartman makes a bet with Kyle that he can make a [[platinum album]] before Kyle can. After recruiting [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and Token, Cartman creates a [[Christian rock]] band called Faith+1 and \"writes\" Christian songs by merely taking love songs and replacing words such as \"baby\" with \"Jesus\" (and which thereby humorously imply sexual relations with Jesus). Against all odds, the band becomes largely successful, managing to sell over a million copies (and potentially gain millions of dollars). However, since Christian rock bands cannot truly get a platinum album (which is not true in real life), Cartman loses the bet. Despite having amassed a large [[Fandom|fan base]] as well as a large, steady income, Cartman only becomes enraged since he was unable to win a bet with Kyle. Careless in his anger accepting the ''[[Myrrh]]'' album in front of a large Christian crowd, Cartman goes into an [[Criticism of Christianity|anti-Christian]] rant which drives away all of the fans as well as profits. Cartman has also been shown to have a high sadistic streak towards Kyle. He has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer.<ref>e.g \"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\"</ref> \nHe has also shown to enjoy Kyle's suffering and humiliation to the extremes.<ref>e.g \"[[Humancentipad]]\",\"[[Ginger Cow]]\"</ref> \nIn \"[[You're Getting Old]]\", the final episode of the first half of ''South Park''<nowiki/>'s [[South Park (season 15)|15th season]], it is suggested that Kyle and Cartman may be developing a genuine friendship, possibly due to the void left by Stan's apparent departure. This soon withers away as both return to the status quo of arch enemies at the end of \"[[Ass Burgers]]\", due to Kyle realizing the repulsive way Cartman was producing his [[Hamburger|burgers]]. Cartman's resentment of Stan is usually reserved for when Cartman proudly proclaims his hatred for both Stan and Kyle as a duo, and his contempt for Stan as an individual is usually limited to his annoyance with Stan's sensitivity, affection for animals, and relationship with [[Wendy Testaburger]].<ref name=\"philo3\">Arp and Jacoby, pp. 58\u201365</ref>\n\nDespite being intolerant of other cultures, Cartman displays an aptitude for learning [[foreign language]]s. In the episode \"[[My Future Self n' Me]]\" when he starts \"Parental Revenge Corp\", he speaks [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to his [[Latinos|Latino]] workers, though he may have learned the language in order to better exploit a labor pool. He also knows [[German language|German]], and once spoke a few phrases while dressed up as [[Adolf Hitler]] while promoting the extermination of Jews to an oblivious audience that did not speak German. Cartman can also be seen speaking broken German with an American accent in Season 15 Episode 2 \"[[Funnybot]]\". Conversely in one episode (\"[[Major Boobage]]\") Cartman acts as an [[Oskar Schindler]] character for the town's cats, a rare case of a subplot based on Cartman's altruism.\n\nCartman frequently teases Kenny for being poor, and derides Kenny's family for being on [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]].<ref name=\"sfrubin\">{{cite news| author = Sylvia Rubin | title = TV 's Foul-Mouthed Funnies| work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = January 26, 1998| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/01/26/DD58819.DTL| accessdate = May 3, 2009}}</ref> He will also use an awkward pause during a conversation as an opportunity to casually remind Kenny that he hates him.<ref name=\"bullzeye\">{{cite news| author = Jamey Codding| title = Bullz-Eye's All-Time Best Cartoon Characters | publisher = Bullz-Eye.com |date = January 28, 2006| url= http://www.bullz-eye.com/entertainment/features/2006/best_cartoon_characters.htm| accessdate = May 11, 2009}}</ref> Cartman's mischievous treatment of [[Butters Stotch]], and the relationship the duo shares, has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series.<ref name=\"growsup2\"/> This reflects Parker's interest; the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.<ref name=\"buttersfave\">{{cite news | author = Dudley Price| title = Butters one of 'South Park' creator Trey Parker's favorite characters.| publisher = [[The America's Intelligence Wire]] | date = December 18, 2003| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19761309_ITM | accessdate = May 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSeveral episodes concern Cartman's greed and his get-rich-quick schemes, although his numerous attempts to attain wealth generally fail.<ref name=\"NPR\"/> His extreme disdain for [[hippie]]s serves to satirize the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and its influence in contemporary society,<ref name=\"cityjournal\"/> reflecting Parker's real-life antipathy towards hippies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/interviews.php?interview=25|title=An interview with Matt Stone|publisher=www.southparkstudios.com/|accessdate=February 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061433/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/interviews.php?interview=25|archivedate=December 19, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though the role is customarily taken by Stan or Kyle, Cartman will occasionally be the one to reflect on the lessons learned during the course of an episode with a speech that often begins with \"You know, I've learned something today...\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smaji/southpark.html |title=List of \"I've learned something today\" quotes including relevant episode citations |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627134449/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smaji/southpark.html |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Character==\n===Creation and design===\n[[File:TreyParkerHWOFApr2013.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cartman is voiced by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]].]]\nA precursor to Cartman first appeared in the first ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short, dubbed ''Jesus vs. Frosty'', created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]].

Cartman is one of four central characters in ''South Park'', along with [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Kenny McCormick]]. Cartman first appeared, originally in prototypical form in a 1992 animated short ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)#Jesus vs. Frosty|Jesus vs. Frosty]]'', and a 1995 animated short ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)#Jesus vs. Santa|Jesus vs. Santa]]'', and first appeared on television in the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of ''South Park'', \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\", on August 13, 1997.\n\nCartman is an [[elementary school]] student who lives with his mother in the fictional town of South Park, [[Colorado]], where he routinely has extraordinary experiences atypical of a small town. Cartman has been portrayed as [[aggression|aggressive]], [[prejudice]]d, [[Pride|arrogant]] and [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] since his character's inception; Stone and Parker describe the character as \"a little [[Archie Bunker]]\". These traits are significantly augmented in later seasons, particularly following the episode \"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\", as his character evolves and he begins to exhibit extremely [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[Sociopathic personality disorder|sociopathic]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behavior and also be depicted as highly [[intelligence|intelligent]], able to execute morally appalling plans and business ideas to get success, but most of his plans usually end up in defeat, mainly due to something or somebody ruining his plans.\n\nCartman is considered to be the most popular and famous character on ''South Park''.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89375695 | title=Eric Cartman: America's Favorite Little $@#&*% | work=[[NPR]] | date=April 5, 2008 | accessdate=July 22, 2013 | author=Rovner, Julie}}</ref><ref name=\"am\">{{cite web | url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-cartman-moments.html | title=Top 10: Cartman Moments | work=[[AskMen]] | accessdate=July 22, 2013 | author=McKee, Ryan}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN top\"/> Parker and Stone state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify. ''South Park'' has received both praise and criticism for Cartman's [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] behavior. Prominent publications and television channels have included Cartman on their lists as one of the most iconic television and cartoon characters of all time.\n\n==Role in ''South Park''==\nEric Cartman attends South Park Elementary as part of [[Mr. Garrison]]'s class. During the show's first 58 episodes, Cartman and the other main characters are in the [[third grade]], after which they move on to the [[fourth grade]]. He is raised as an [[only child]] by [[Liane Cartman]], a promiscuous single mother. In \"[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]\" (1998), Liane Cartman is said to be a [[hermaphrodite]] and the father of Cartman who did not know the woman who gave birth to Cartman.<ref name=\"mcfarland1\">{{cite news| first = Melanie | last = McFarland| title= Oh my God, 'South Park' killed a decade!| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date= September 30, 2006|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/287052_southpark02.html| accessdate = May 9, 2009}}</ref> However, the [[South Park (season 14)|season 14]] (2010) episode \"[[201 (South Park)|201]]\" later reveals that Liane actually is his mother, and that his true biological father is Jack Tenorman, a fictional former player for the [[Denver Broncos]] whom Cartman arranged to be killed in the [[South Park (season 5)|season five]] (2001) episode \"[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]\", making Cartman and Scott Tenorman half-brothers.<ref name=\"cartmandad\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/articles/201,40382/|title=201|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|date=21 April 2010|work=The A.V.

The two have shared an enmity since the show's beginnings, and their rivalry has become significantly more pronounced as the series has progressed, with Cartman even routinely exposing Kyle to physical endangerment. For instance, in \"[[Tonsil Trouble]],\" Cartman deliberately infected Kyle with [[HIV]].<ref name=\"growsup2\"/><ref name=\"AIDS\">{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/859/859352p1.html|title=\"Tonsil Trouble\" Review|website=IGN|accessdate=Oct 12, 2009}}</ref> Kyle has intentionally endangered Cartman as well by convincing him in \"[[Fatbeard]]\" to go to [[Somalia]] in hopes that he will be killed. Their rivalry stems from opposition in personalities. Where Kyle is restrained by firm morals, Cartman would rather indulge in pleasure, and goes out of his way to hurt others.\n\nHowever, Kyle is sometimes an enthusiastic participant in Cartman's schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen treating Kyle well, although this is generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal, or for manipulation.<ref>e.g. ''[[Wing (South Park)]]'', ''[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]''</ref> Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by [[Archie Bunker]] and [[Michael Stivic|Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic]] on the 1970s [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]''. Kyle has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation in this regard is not merely monetary gain, but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode \"[[Imaginationland: The Movie|Imaginationland]]\" ([[South Park (season 11)|season 11]], 2007).<ref name=\"growsup2\"/> This obsession has also proven itself to trump other goals Cartman wishes to achieve, for instance, in \"[[Christian Rock Hard]]\" Cartman makes a bet with Kyle that he can make a [[platinum album]] before Kyle can. After recruiting [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and Token, Cartman creates a [[Christian rock]] band called Faith+1 and \"writes\" Christian songs by merely taking love songs and replacing words such as \"baby\" with \"Jesus\" (and which thereby humorously imply sexual relations with Jesus). Against all odds, the band becomes largely successful, managing to sell over a million copies (and potentially gain millions of dollars). However, since Christian rock bands cannot truly get a platinum album (which is not true in real life), Cartman loses the bet. Despite having amassed a large [[Fandom|fan base]] as well as a large, steady income, Cartman only becomes enraged since he was unable to win a bet with Kyle. Careless in his anger accepting the ''[[Myrrh]]'' album in front of a large Christian crowd, Cartman goes into an [[Criticism of Christianity|anti-Christian]] rant which drives away all of the fans as well as profits. Cartman has also been shown to have a high sadistic streak towards Kyle. He has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer.<ref>e.g \"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\"</ref> \nHe has also shown to enjoy Kyle's suffering and humiliation to the extremes.<ref>e.g \"[[Humancentipad]]\",\"[[Ginger Cow]]\"</ref> \nIn \"[[You're Getting Old]]\", the final episode of the first half of ''South Park''<nowiki/>'s [[South Park (season 15)|15th season]], it is suggested that Kyle and Cartman may be developing a genuine friendship, possibly due to the void left by Stan's apparent departure. This soon withers away as both return to the status quo of arch enemies at the end of \"[[Ass Burgers]]\", due to Kyle realizing the repulsive way Cartman was producing his [[Hamburger|burgers]]. Cartman's resentment of Stan is usually reserved for when Cartman proudly proclaims his hatred for both Stan and Kyle as a duo, and his contempt for Stan as an individual is usually limited to his annoyance with Stan's sensitivity, affection for animals, and relationship with [[Wendy Testaburger]].<ref name=\"philo3\">Arp and Jacoby, pp. 58\u201365</ref>\n\nDespite being intolerant of other cultures, Cartman displays an aptitude for learning [[foreign language]]s. In the episode \"[[My Future Self n' Me]]\" when he starts \"Parental Revenge Corp\", he speaks [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to his [[Latinos|Latino]] workers, though he may have learned the language in order to better exploit a labor pool. He also knows [[German language|German]], and once spoke a few phrases while dressed up as [[Adolf Hitler]] while promoting the extermination of Jews to an oblivious audience that did not speak German. Cartman can also be seen speaking broken German with an American accent in Season 15 Episode 2 \"[[Funnybot]]\". Conversely in one episode (\"[[Major Boobage]]\") Cartman acts as an [[Oskar Schindler]] character for the town's cats, a rare case of a subplot based on Cartman's altruism.\n\nCartman frequently teases Kenny for being poor, and derides Kenny's family for being on [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]].<ref name=\"sfrubin\">{{cite news| author = Sylvia Rubin | title = TV 's Foul-Mouthed Funnies| work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = January 26, 1998| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/01/26/DD58819.DTL| accessdate = May 3, 2009}}</ref> He will also use an awkward pause during a conversation as an opportunity to casually remind Kenny that he hates him.<ref name=\"bullzeye\">{{cite news| author = Jamey Codding| title = Bullz-Eye's All-Time Best Cartoon Characters | publisher = Bullz-Eye.com |date = January 28, 2006| url= http://www.bullz-eye.com/entertainment/features/2006/best_cartoon_characters.htm| accessdate = May 11, 2009}}</ref> Cartman's mischievous treatment of [[Butters Stotch]], and the relationship the duo shares, has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series.<ref name=\"growsup2\"/> This reflects Parker's interest; the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.<ref name=\"buttersfave\">{{cite news | author = Dudley Price| title = Butters one of 'South Park' creator Trey Parker's favorite characters.| publisher = [[The America's Intelligence Wire]] | date = December 18, 2003| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19761309_ITM | accessdate = May 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSeveral episodes concern Cartman's greed and his get-rich-quick schemes, although his numerous attempts to attain wealth generally fail.<ref name=\"NPR\"/> His extreme disdain for [[hippie]]s serves to satirize the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and its influence in contemporary society,<ref name=\"cityjournal\"/> reflecting Parker's real-life antipathy towards hippies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/interviews.php?interview=25|title=An interview with Matt Stone|publisher=www.southparkstudios.com/|accessdate=February 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061433/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/interviews.php?interview=25|archivedate=December 19, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though the role is customarily taken by Stan or Kyle, Cartman will occasionally be the one to reflect on the lessons learned during the course of an episode with a speech that often begins with \"You know, I've learned something today...\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smaji/southpark.html |title=List of \"I've learned something today\" quotes including relevant episode citations |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627134449/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smaji/southpark.html |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Character==\n===Creation and design===\n[[File:TreyParkerHWOFApr2013.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cartman is voiced by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]].]]\nA precursor to Cartman first appeared in the first ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short, dubbed ''Jesus vs. Frosty'', created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]].
