German Nationalism emphasizes and takes pride in the [[national identity]] of Germans. The earliest origins of German nationalism began with the birth of [[romantic nationalism]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when [[Pan-Germanism]] started to rise. Advocacy of a German nation-state began to become an important political force in response to the invasion of German territories by France under [[Napoleon]].\n\nIn the 19th century Germans debated the [[German Question]] over whether the German nation state should comprise a \"[[Lesser Germany]]\" that excluded [[Austria]] or a \"Greater Germany\" that included Austria.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} The faction led by [[Prussia]]n [[Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in forging a Lesser Germany.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}}\n\nAggressive German nationalism and territorial expansion was a key factor leading to both World Wars. Prior to [[World War I]], Germany had established a [[German colonial empire|colonial empire]] in hopes of rivaling Britain and France. In the 1930s, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power and sought to create a [[Greater Germanic Reich]], emphasizing ethnic German identity and German greatness to the exclusion of all others, eventually leading to the extermination of [[Jews]], [[Poles]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and other people deemed ''[[Untermensch]]en'' (subhumans) in [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]].\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the country was divided into [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] in the opening acts of the [[Cold War]], and each state retained a sense of German identity and held reunification as a goal, albeit in different contexts. The creation of the [[European Union]] was in part an effort to harness German identity to a [[Pan-European identity|European identity]]. West Germany underwent its [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]] following the war, which led to the creation of a [[Gastarbeiter|guest worker program]]; many of these workers ended up settling in Germany which has led to tensions around questions of national and cultural identity, especially with regard to [[Turks in Germany|Turks who settled in Germany]].\n\n[[German reunification]] was achieved in 1990 following ''[[Die Wende]]''; an event that caused some alarm both inside and outside Germany. Germany has emerged as a power inside Europe and in the world; its role in the [[European debt crisis]] and in the [[European migrant crisis]] have led to criticism of German authoritarian abuse of its power, especially with regard to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek debt crisis]], and raised questions within and without Germany as to Germany's role in the world.\n\nDue to post-1945 repudiation of the Nazi regime and its atrocities, German nationalism has been generally viewed in the country as taboo{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=190}} and people within Germany have struggled to find ways to acknowledge its past but take pride in its past and present accomplishments; the German question has never been fully resolved in this regard. A wave of national pride swept the country when it hosted the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Far-right politics in Germany|Far-right]] parties that stress German national identity and pride have existed since the end of World War II but have never governed.\n\n==History==\n===Defining a German nation===\n[[File:Germania Te\u00fctschland at eRara.jpg|thumb|This map published in Z\u00fcrich in 1548 defines \"the German Nation\" based on its traditions, customs and language.<ref>\"[https://historiaymapas.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/nacionalismo-aleman-en-un-mapa-de-1548/ Nacionalismo alem\u00e1n en un mapa de 1548]\", in ''Historia y Mapas''</ref>]]\n\nDefining a German nation based on internal characteristics presented difficulties. Since the start of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, the German lands had been divided between [[Catholics]] and [[Lutherans]] and linguistic diversity was large as well. Today, the [[Swabian German|Swabian]], [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]], [[Low German|Saxon]] and [[Colognian language|Cologne]] [[German dialects|dialects]] in their most pure forms are estimated to be 40% [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with more modern [[Standard German]], meaning that in a conversation between any native speakers of any of these dialects and a person who speaks only standard German, the latter will be able to understand slightly less than half of what is being said without any prior knowledge of the dialect, a situation which is likely to have been similar or greater in the 19th century.<ref>[https://www.ethnologue.com/country/de/languages/***EDITION*** Ethnologue, mutual intelligibility of German dialects / Languages of Germany.]</ref>\n\nNationalism among the Germans first developed not among the general populace but among the intellectual elites of various German states. The early German nationalist [[Friedrich Karl von Moser]], writing in the mid 18th century, remarked that, compared with \"the British, Swiss, Dutch and Swedes\", the Germans lacked a \"national way of thinking\".<ref name=\"Jansen239-240\">Jansen, Christian (2011), \"The Formation of German Nationalism, 1740\u20131850,\" in: Helmut Walser Smith (Ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IPngdGug27kC&pg=PA239 The Oxford Handbook of Modern German History]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 234-259; here: p. 239-240.</ref> However, the cultural elites themselves faced difficulties in defining the German nation, often resorting to broad and vague concepts: the Germans as a \"Sprachnation\" (a people unified by the same language), a \"Kulturnation\" (a people unified by the same culture) or an \"Erinnerungsgemeinschaft\" (a community of remembrance, i.e. sharing a common history).<ref name=\"Jansen239-240\"/> [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the founding father of German nationalism<ref>The German Opposition to Hitler, Michael C. Thomsett (1997) p7.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 devoted the 4th of his ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]'' (1808) to defining the German nation and did so in a very broad manner. In his view, there existed a dichotomy between the people of Germanic descent. There were those who had left their fatherland (which Fichte considered to be Germany) during the time of the [[Migration Period]] and had become either assimilated or heavily influenced by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Latin|language]], [[Culture of Ancient Rome|culture]] and [[Roman Law|customs]], and those who stayed in their native lands and continued to hold on to their own culture.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/addressestogerma00fich Address to the German Nation, p52.]</ref>\n\nLater German nationalists were able to define their nation more precisely, especially following the rise of [[Prussia]] and formation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 which gave the majority of the German-speakers in Europe a common political, economic and educational framework. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, some German nationalist added elements of racial ideology, ultimately culminating in the [[Nuremberg Laws]], sections of which sought to determine by law and genetics who was to be considered German.<ref>The German Opposition to Hitler, Michael C. Thomsett (1997)</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Herder by K\u00fcgelgen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Gottfried Herder]], the founder of the concept of nationalism itself, although he did not support its program.]]\nIt was not until the concept of nationalism itself was developed by German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] that German nationalism began.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=189\u2013190}} German nationalism was [[Romanticism|Romantic]] in nature and was based upon the principles of collective self-determination, territorial unification and cultural identity, and a political and cultural programme to achieve those ends.{{sfn|Smith|2010|pp=24}} The German [[Romantic nationalism]] derived from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] philosopher [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]]'s and [[French Revolution]]ary philosopher [[Emmanuel-Joseph Siey\u00e8s]]' ideas of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and that legitimate nations must have been conceived in the [[state of nature]]. This emphasis on the naturalness of ethno-linguistic nations continued to be upheld by the early-19th-century Romantic German nationalists [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]], and [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]], who all were proponents of [[Pan-Germanism]].{{sfn|Smith|2010|pp=41}}\n\nThe invasion of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (HRE) by Napoleon's [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its subsequent dissolution brought about a German [[liberal nationalism]] as advocated primarily by the German middle-class bourgeoisie who advocated the creation of a modern German [[nation-state]] based upon [[liberal democracy]], [[constitutionalism]], representation, and [[popular sovereignty]] while opposing [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]].{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7}} Fichte in particular brought German nationalism forward as a response to the French occupation of German territories in his ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]'' (1808), evoking a sense of German distinctiveness in language, tradition, and literature that composed a common identity.{{sfn|Jusdanis|2001|pp=82\u201383}}\n\nAfter the defeat of France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]], German nationalists tried but failed to establish Germany as a nation-state, instead the [[German Confederation]] was created that was a loose collection of independent German states that lacked strong federal institutions.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7}} Economic integration between the German states was achieved by the creation of the ''[[Zollverein]]'' (\"Custom Union\") of Germany in 1818 that existed until 1866.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7}} The move to create the ''Zollverein'' was led by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and the Zollverein was dominated by Prussia, causing resentment and tension between [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and Prussia.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7}}\n\n===Revolutions of 1848 to German Unification of 1871===\n[[File:Frankfurt Nationalversammlung 1848.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Depiction of the session of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] in 1848.]]\n[[File:Image Germania (painting).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Germania'', painting by [[Philipp Veit]], 1848.]]\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848]] led to many revolutions in various German states.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7}} Nationalists did seize power in a number of German states and an all-German parliament was created in [[Frankfurt]] in May 1848.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7}} The [[Frankfurt Parliament]] attempted to create a [[national constitution]] for all [[German states]] but rivalry between Prussian and Austrian interests resulted in proponents of the parliament advocating a \"small German\" solution (a monarchical German nation-state without Austria) with the [[imperial crown of Germany]] being granted to the [[King of Prussia]].{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7}} The King of Prussia refused the offer and efforts to create a leftist German nation-state faltered and collapsed.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed attempt to establish a liberal German nation-state, rivalry between Prussia and Austria intensified under the agenda of Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] who blocked all attempts by Austria to join the ''Zollverein''.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} A division developed among German nationalists, with one group led by the Prussians that supported a \"Lesser Germany\" that excluded Austria and another group that supported a \"[[Greater Germany]]\" that included Austria.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} The Prussians sought a Lesser Germany to allow Prussia to assert hegemony over Germany that would not be guaranteed in a Greater Germany.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} This was a major propaganda point later asserted by Hitler.\n\nBy the late 1850s German nationalists emphasized military solutions. The mood was fed by hatred of the French, a fear of Russia, a rejection of the 1815 Vienna settlement, and a cult of patriotic hero-warriors. War seemed to be a desirable means of speeding up change and progress. Nationalists thrilled to the image of the entire people in arms. Bismarck harnessed the national movement's martial pride and desire for unity and glory to weaken the political threat the liberal opposition posed to Prussia's conservatism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lorenz M\u00fcller | first1 = Frank | year = 2007 | title = The Spectre of a People in Arms: The Prussian Government and the Militarisation of German Nationalism, 1859\u20131864 | journal = English Historical Review | volume = 122 | issue = 495| pages = 82\u2013104 | jstor=20108205 | doi=10.1093/ehr/cel374}}</ref>\n\nPrussia achieved hegemony over Germany in the \"wars of unification\": the [[Second Schleswig War]] (1864), the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (which effectively excluded Austria from Germany) (1866), and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870).{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} A German nation-state was founded in 1871 called the [[German Empire]] as a Lesser Germany with the King of Prussia taking the throne of [[German Emperor]] (''Deutscher Kaiser'') and Bismarck becoming [[Chancellor of Germany]].{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}}\n\n===1871 to World War I, 1914\u20131918===\nUnlike the prior German nationalism of 1848 that was based upon liberal values, the German nationalism utilized by supporters of the German Empire was based upon Prussian [[authoritarianism]], and was conservative, [[reactionary]], [[anti-Catholic]], [[liberalism|anti-liberal]] and [[Anti-socialism|anti-socialist]] in nature.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8, 25}} The German Empire's supporters advocated a Germany based upon Prussian and Protestant cultural dominance.{{sfn|Kesselman|2009|pp=181}} This German nationalism focused on German identity based upon the historical crusading [[Teutonic Order]].{{sfn|Samson|2002|pp=440}} These nationalists supported a German national identity claimed to be based on Bismarck's ideals that included Teutonic values of willpower, loyalty, honesty, and perseverance.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2005|pp=20}}\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]-[[Protestant]] divide in Germany at times created extreme tension and hostility between Catholic and Protestant Germans after 1871, such as in response to the policy of ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in [[Prussia]] by German Chancellor and Prussian Prime Minister [[Otto von Bismarck]], that sought to dismantle [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] culture in Prussia, that provoked outrage amongst Germany's Catholics and resulted in the rise of the pro-Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] and the [[Bavarian People's Party]].<ref>Wolfram Kaiser, Helmut Wohnout.

German colonial rule in Africa 1884\u20131914 was an expression of nationalism and moral superiority that was justified by constructing employing an image of the natives as \"Other\".

German Nationalism emphasizes and takes pride in the [[national identity]] of Germans. The earliest origins of German nationalism began with the birth of [[romantic nationalism]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when [[Pan-Germanism]] started to rise. Advocacy of a German nation-state began to become an important political force in response to the invasion of German territories by France under [[Napoleon]].\n\nIn the 19th century Germans debated the [[German Question]] over whether the German nation state should comprise a \"[[Lesser Germany]]\" that excluded [[Austria]] or a \"Greater Germany\" that included Austria.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}} The faction led by [[Prussia]]n [[Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in forging a Lesser Germany.{{sfn|Verheyen|1999|pp=8}}\n\nAggressive German nationalism and territorial expansion was a key factor leading to both World Wars. Prior to [[World War I]], Germany had established a [[German colonial empire|colonial empire]] in hopes of rivaling Britain and France. In the 1930s, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power and sought to create a [[Greater Germanic Reich]], emphasizing ethnic German identity and German greatness to the exclusion of all others, eventually leading to the extermination of [[Jews]], [[Poles]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and other people deemed ''[[Untermensch]]en'' (subhumans) in [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]].\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the country was divided into [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] in the opening acts of the [[Cold War]], and each state retained a sense of German identity and held reunification as a goal, albeit in different contexts. The creation of the [[European Union]] was in part an effort to harness German identity to a [[Pan-European identity|European identity]]. West Germany underwent its [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]] following the war, which led to the creation of a [[Gastarbeiter|guest worker program]]; many of these workers ended up settling in Germany which has led to tensions around questions of national and cultural identity, especially with regard to [[Turks in Germany|Turks who settled in Germany]].\n\n[[German reunification]] was achieved in 1990 following ''[[Die Wende]]''; an event that caused some alarm both inside and outside Germany. Germany has emerged as a power inside Europe and in the world; its role in the [[European debt crisis]] and in the [[European migrant crisis]] have led to criticism of German authoritarian abuse of its power, especially with regard to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek debt crisis]], and raised questions within and without Germany as to Germany's role in the world.\n\nDue to post-1945 repudiation of the Nazi regime and its atrocities, German nationalism has been generally viewed in the country as taboo{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=190}} and people within Germany have struggled to find ways to acknowledge its past but take pride in its past and present accomplishments; the German question has never been fully resolved in this regard. A wave of national pride swept the country when it hosted the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Far-right politics in Germany|Far-right]] parties that stress German national identity and pride have existed since the end of World War II but have never governed.\n\n==History==\n===Defining a German nation===\n[[File:Germania Te\u00fctschland at eRara.jpg|thumb|This map published in Z\u00fcrich in 1548 defines \"the German Nation\" based on its traditions, customs and language.<ref>\"[https://historiaymapas.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/nacionalismo-aleman-en-un-mapa-de-1548/ Nacionalismo alem\u00e1n en un mapa de 1548]\", in ''Historia y Mapas''</ref>]]\n\nDefining a German nation based on internal characteristics presented difficulties. Since the start of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, the German lands had been divided between [[Catholics]] and [[Lutherans]] and linguistic diversity was large as well.

The creative and expressive aspects \u2013 the aesthetics \u2013 are more important than conveying information through sound. Practices include installations, performances, public art and interactions between humans through digitally-augmented objects/environments. These often integrate elements such as embedded technology, gesture-sensitive devices, speakers or context-aware systems.\n\nThe experience is in the focus, addressing how humans are affected by the sound, and vice versa. Interactive art and music allows us to question existing paradigms and models of how we interact with technology and sound, going beyond paradigms of control (human controlling a machine). Users are part of a loop which includes action and perception.\n\nInteractive art and music projects invite explorative actions and playful engagement. There is also a multi-sensory aspect, especially haptic-audio<ref>The fifth International Workshop on Haptic and Audio Interaction Design (HAID) on September 16\u201317, 2010 in Copenhagen, Denmark. http://media.aau.dk/haid10/?page_id=46</ref> and audio-visual projects are popular.

Sonification does not necessarily need to represent huge amounts of data in sound, but may only convey one or few data values in a sound. To give an example, imagine a light switch that, on activation would create a short sound that depends on the electric power consumed through the cable: more energy-wasting lamps would perhaps systematically result in more annoying switch sounds. This example shows that sonification aims to provide some information by using its systematic transformation into sound.\n\nThe integration of data-driven elements in interaction sound may serve different purposes: \n*  to allow the users to refine their actions via auditory feedback. Example: the sonification-enhanced drilling machine<ref>Tobias Grosshauser and Thomas Hermann, (2010). \"Multimodal closed-loop Human Machine Interaction\" Proc. Interactive Sonification Workshop, Stockholm, http://interactive-sonification.org/ISon2010/proceedings</ref> which indicates by sound when a wanted orientation to the wall is reached.\n* to create a sonic [[:wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] for the interaction which allows users to compare the detailed performance on repeated interactions: for instance rowing strokes may be sonified so that the sportsmen can better synchronize their action.\n* to enable novel functions that would otherwise be not available (e.g. a bottle that displays by sound how much fluid is poured into glasses so that the users can more easily fill the equal amount of liquid in different glasses).\n\nWithin the field of sonification, sonic interaction design acknowledges the importance of human [[interaction]] for understanding and using auditory [[feedback]].<ref>Thomas Hermann, and Andy Hunt, (2005). \"Guest Editors' Introduction: An Introduction to Interactive Sonification\".

Poulsbo was founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the [[Midwest|Midwestern states]]. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the [[Puget Sound mosquito fleet]], which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century.\n\nModern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, [[Poulsbo Bread]], is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally. Many visitors arrive by boat; there are three [[marina]]s near the town, and the town's harbor is an excellent anchorage.\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo.jpg|thumb|left|First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo]]\n\nThe [[Suquamish]] people inhabited the area at the north end of [[Liberty Bay]] for millennia and had several names for modern-day Poulsbo; one of those names, ''tcu-tcu-lats'', means \"place of the maples\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/business/311052921.html |title=Viking Avenue business owner will replace trees he cut down |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=June 30, 2015 |first=Richard |last=Walker |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> The Suquamish occupied villages on the Liberty Bay shoreline \u2014 among them, ''ho-CHEEB''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/news/304004031.html |title=1 million Norwegians immigrated to U.S. between 1820 and 1920 {{!}} Viking Fest |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=May 16, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> \u2014 for at least 5,000 years, hunted in local forests and floodplains, fished in bays and streams here, and harvested shellfish along the shoreline.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, most Suquamish people here relocated to the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation]], although the Suquamish Tribe reserved \u2014 and to this day exercises \u2014 certain cultural and natural resource rights in its historical territory, including Poulsbo.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Oyster dyke at Poulsbo, Washington, June 1920 (COBB 143).jpeg|thumb|[[Oyster farming]] in Poulsbo, 1920]]\n\nFounded by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason in the 1880s, Poulsbo was settled in its early years by a large number of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and other [[Scandinavia]]n immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries.<ref name=majors>{{Cite book| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | page = 82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 978-0-918664-00-6}}</ref> In 1886, I.B. Moe, one of the early Norwegian settlers, suggested that the community should have a post office. Moe suggested the town be named \"Paulsbo\" (which translates as \"Paul's place\"), after the village in [[Halden]], Norway,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mapcarta.com/31279866 |title=Paulsbo |website=Mapcarta}}</ref> where Moe spent his early years. The community's petition for a post office was granted and Moe became the first postmaster, but authorities in Washington, D.C. misspelled the town's name, likely misreading Moe's handwriting,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and the community became known as \"Poulsbo\" thereafter. Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907.\n\nUntil [[World War II]], many Poulsbo residents retained [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] as a primary language. However, during [[World War II]], the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]]. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of [[English language|English]] as the primary language.\n\nOn October 22, 1975, King [[Olav V of Norway]] visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States.<ref name=Jacobi>{{cite news | title = King at home in Poulsbo | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | year = 1975 | url= http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8361 }}</ref> His son, Harald, visited 20 years later.\n\n==Schools==\nPoulsbo is home to many different [[state school|public schools]] in the North Kitsap School District. North Kitsap High School, Poulsbo Middle School, Poulsbo Elementary School and Vinland Elementary School are located within the city limits, while Pearson Elementary School lies south of town.

Poulsbo was founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the [[Midwest|Midwestern states]]. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the [[Puget Sound mosquito fleet]], which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century.\n\nModern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, [[Poulsbo Bread]], is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally. Many visitors arrive by boat; there are three [[marina]]s near the town, and the town's harbor is an excellent anchorage.\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo.jpg|thumb|left|First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo]]\n\nThe [[Suquamish]] people inhabited the area at the north end of [[Liberty Bay]] for millennia and had several names for modern-day Poulsbo; one of those names, ''tcu-tcu-lats'', means \"place of the maples\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/business/311052921.html |title=Viking Avenue business owner will replace trees he cut down |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=June 30, 2015 |first=Richard |last=Walker |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> The Suquamish occupied villages on the Liberty Bay shoreline \u2014 among them, ''ho-CHEEB''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/news/304004031.html |title=1 million Norwegians immigrated to U.S. between 1820 and 1920 {{!}} Viking Fest |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=May 16, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> \u2014 for at least 5,000 years, hunted in local forests and floodplains, fished in bays and streams here, and harvested shellfish along the shoreline.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, most Suquamish people here relocated to the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation]], although the Suquamish Tribe reserved \u2014 and to this day exercises \u2014 certain cultural and natural resource rights in its historical territory, including Poulsbo.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Oyster dyke at Poulsbo, Washington, June 1920 (COBB 143).jpeg|thumb|[[Oyster farming]] in Poulsbo, 1920]]\n\nFounded by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason in the 1880s, Poulsbo was settled in its early years by a large number of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and other [[Scandinavia]]n immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries.<ref name=majors>{{Cite book| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | page = 82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 978-0-918664-00-6}}</ref> In 1886, I.B.

The community's petition for a post office was granted and Moe became the first postmaster, but authorities in Washington, D.C. misspelled the town's name, likely misreading Moe's handwriting,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and the community became known as \"Poulsbo\" thereafter. Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907.\n\nUntil [[World War II]], many Poulsbo residents retained [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] as a primary language. However, during [[World War II]], the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]]. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of [[English language|English]] as the primary language.\n\nOn October 22, 1975, King [[Olav V of Norway]] visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States.<ref name=Jacobi>{{cite news | title = King at home in Poulsbo | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | year = 1975 | url= http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8361 }}</ref> His son, Harald, visited 20 years later.\n\n==Schools==\nPoulsbo is home to many different [[state school|public schools]] in the North Kitsap School District.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a six-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=219}} Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"{{snd}}he had earned his father's approval, which he had long sought. When Gacy's parents visited in July 1966, his father apologized for the abuse he had inflicted during Gacy's childhood, and said: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nMany Jaycees in Waterloo were involved in [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use; Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly had sex with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} He opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees could drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances; if rebuffed, Gacy would claim these advances were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded Voorhees to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support.

Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face, and beat him. Schroeder agreed, and in early September, he lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace into the youth's eyes, then beat him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request.

Gacy claimed Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, to be served at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} That same day, his wife petitioned for divorce,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting award of the couple's home and property, sole custody of their two children, and [[alimony]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} who claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the boy into sex. This complaint was dismissed when the boy failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago.

In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}} \n\nBy 1975, PDM was expanding rapidly and Gacy was working up to 16 hours per day. In March 1977, he became a supervisor for PE Systems, a firm specializing in the remodeling of drugstores. Between PE Systems and PDM, Gacy worked on up to four projects at once and frequently traveled to other states.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} By 1978, PDM's annual revenue was over $200,000.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=221}}\n====Employees====\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased.

When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a high school wrestler\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy at first threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci would remove the handcuffs. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy told him: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs, you got them on me\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n=====Cram and Rossi=====\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram.

Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself from the handcuffs. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him, saying: \"Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=172}} Cram resisted and Gacy left the bedroom.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home. Gacy later stated that as he placed the tourniquet around Piest's neck, Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref> He also admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying on his bedroom floor.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=231}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. {{ISBN|978-1401095314}} p. 148</ref> Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nCram himself informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976 and stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} Some victims he referred to by name, but most names he claimed not to know or remember.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18 Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner who supervised the exhumations, testified that all the bodies were \"markedly decomposed<!--,--> [and] putrefied<!--, skeletalized remains-->\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Mother Cries at Description of Son's Grave|date=February 19, 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VHVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mn4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2366,5212913 |newspaper=The Calgary Herald |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> and that of all the autopsies he performed, thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation, six of ligature strangulation, one of multiple stab wounds to the chest,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=102}} and ten in undetermined ways.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=322}}{{efn|Stein performed autopsies on each victim recovered at Gacy's property and upon the body of Robert Piest.

Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|upright=1|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

At the bar, the officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the employee asked Gacy, \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a six-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=219}} Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"{{snd}}he had earned his father's approval, which he had long sought. When Gacy's parents visited in July 1966, his father apologized for the abuse he had inflicted during Gacy's childhood, and said: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nMany Jaycees in Waterloo were involved in [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use; Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly had sex with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} He opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees could drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances; if rebuffed, Gacy would claim these advances were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded Voorhees to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face, and beat him. Schroeder agreed, and in early September, he lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace into the youth's eyes, then beat him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n===Conviction and imprisonment===\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nOn November 7, 1968 Gacy pled guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths. Gacy claimed Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, to be served at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} That same day, his wife petitioned for divorce,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting award of the couple's home and property, sole custody of their two children, and [[alimony]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} who claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the boy into sex. This complaint was dismissed when the boy failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters.

His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct.

The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}} \n\nBy 1975, PDM was expanding rapidly and Gacy was working up to 16 hours per day. In March 1977, he became a supervisor for PE Systems, a firm specializing in the remodeling of drugstores. Between PE Systems and PDM, Gacy worked on up to four projects at once and frequently traveled to other states.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} By 1978, PDM's annual revenue was over $200,000.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=221}}\n====Employees====\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the employee in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} After returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy told his wife he had been attacked for refusing to pay the employee for poor-quality work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy went to Antonucci's home. The two drank a bottle of wine, then watched a heterosexual [[stag film]] before Gacy wrestled Antonucci to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} One cuff was loose and Antonucci freed his arm while Gacy was out of the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a high school wrestler\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy at first threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci would remove the handcuffs. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy told him: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs, you got them on me\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n=====Cram and Rossi=====\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram.

Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself from the handcuffs. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him, saying: \"Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=172}} Cram resisted and Gacy left the bedroom.

Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items.

In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} Some victims he referred to by name, but most names he claimed not to know or remember.

Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977.

Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|upright=1|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed.

Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces.

He played [[college football]] at [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]], where he was recognized as a unanimous [[All-America]]n. He was drafted by the Rams with the thirteenth pick in the first round of the [[2014 NFL Draft]]. He has been selected to six [[Pro Bowl]]s in his six years into the league, won the [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]] and has twice been named as the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year]], having won it back-to-back in 2017 and 2018. Donald has been cited as one of the greatest interior defensive linemen of all time.\n\n==Early life==\nA native of [[Pittsburgh]], Donald grew up as one of three children in a working-class family in the city's [[Lincoln\u2013Lemington\u2013Belmar (Pittsburgh)|Lincoln\u2013Lemington\u2013Belmar]] neighborhood. His father Archie, whose football career ended due to a patellar fracture suffered while playing at [[Norfolk State Spartans football|Norfolk State]], introduced Aaron to strength training when he was 12, seeking to provide more structure in his son's life. Aaron himself would later admit that he was \"lazy as a kid\". By age 14, he and his father woke up at 4:30 am and almost immediately proceeded to work out for nearly two hours in the basement gym that Archie installed in the family home.<ref name=Gonzalez>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/los-angeles-rams/post/_/id/39627/how-rams-dt-aaron-donald-became-the-nfls-most-unstoppable-force |title=How Rams DT Aaron Donald became the NFL's most unstoppable force |first=Alden |last=Gonzalez |website=ESPN.com |date=January 12, 2019 |accessdate=January 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDonald attended [[Penn Hills High School]], where he played [[high school football]] for head coach Ron Graham.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://triblive.com/sports/nfl/14566877-74/penn-hills-cherishes-aaron-donald-as-he-prepares-for-super-bowl-debut |title=Penn Hills cherishes Aaron Donald as he prepares for Super Bowl debut |last=Divittorio |first=Michael |website=triblive.com |access-date=February 11, 2019}}</ref> He was selected first team All-State Class AAAA in each of his final two seasons, and compiled 63 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, and 11 sacks as a senior.

When Aaron was named Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2014, he bought his father a used truck; four years later, he bought his father a $40,000 [[Rolex]] watch as a birthday present. A few weeks after he signed his most recent contract extension, he set up both of his parents (who by that time had divorced) with retirement funds sufficient to allow both to permanently stop working, plus brand-new homes of their choosing. His father's new home was in [[Penn Hills Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], near Aaron's old high school. However, at Aaron's and Archie Jr.'s insistence, Archie Sr. never sold his old home. All three still occasionally return to their old basement gym for offseason workouts.<ref name=Gonzalez/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.therams.com/team/players-roster/aaron-donald/ Los Angeles Rams bio]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131104055501/http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/aaron_donald_710949.html Pittsburgh Panthers bio]\n\n{{Los Angeles Rams roster navbox}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Aaron Donald\u2014awards and honors\n| list1 =\n{{Lombardi Award}}\n{{Bronko Nagurski Trophy}}\n{{Chuck Bednarik Award}}\n{{Outland Trophy}}\n{{2013 NCAA Division I FBS College Football Consensus All-Americans}}\n{{2014 NFL Draft}}\n{{RamsFirstPick}}\n{{St. Louis Rams 2014 draft navbox}}\n{{AP Defensive Rookies of the Year}}\n{{AP Defensive Players of the Year}}\n{{NFL sack leaders}}\n{{NFL Top 100}}\n{{NFL2010s}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donald, Aaron}}\n[[Category:1991 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:African-American players of American football]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:American football defensive tackles]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh Panthers football players]]\n[[Category:All-American college football players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Rams players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Rams players]]\n[[Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players]]\n[[Category:Unconferenced Pro Bowl players]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American football defensive tackle}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox NFL biography\n| name = Aaron Donald\n| image = Aaron donald 2019 (cropped).jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = Donald in 2019\n| current_team = Los Angeles Rams\n| number = 99\n| position = [[Defensive tackle]]\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1991|5|23}}\n| birth_place = [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]\n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| height_ft = 6\n| height_in = 1\n| weight_lbs = 280\n| high_school = [[Penn Hills High School|Penn Hills]]<br/>(Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n| college = [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]\n| draftyear = 2014\n| draftround = 1\n| draftpick = 13\n| pastteams = \n* [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]] / [[Los Angeles Rams]] ({{NFL Year|2014}}\u2013present)\n| status = Active\n| highlights = \n* 6\u00d7 [[Pro Bowl]] ([[2015 Pro Bowl|2014]]\u2013[[2020 Pro Bowl|2019]])\n* 5\u00d7 First-team [[All-Pro]] ([[2015 All-Pro Team|2015]]\u2013[[2019 All-Pro Team|2019]])\n* 2\u00d7 [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] (2017, 2018)\n* [[NFL sacks leader]] (2018)\n* [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]] (2014)\n* [[PFWA All-Rookie Team]] ([[PFWA All-Rookie Team#2014|2014]])\n* [[NFL 2010s All-Decade Team]]\n* [[ACC Defensive Player of the Year]] (2013)\n* [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]] (2013)\n* [[Chuck Bednarik Award]] (2013)\n* [[Lombardi Award]] (2013)\n* [[Outland Trophy]] (2013)\n* [[Unanimous All-American]] ([[2013 College Football All-America Team|2013]])\n* All-[[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] team (2013)\n* All-[[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|Big East]] team (2012)\n* Second-team All-[[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|Big East]] (2011)\n| statseason = 2019\n| statweek   = 17\n| statlabel1 = [[Tackle (football move)|Tackles]]\n| statvalue1 = 312\n| statlabel2 = [[Quarterback sack|Sacks]]\n| statvalue2 = 72\n| statlabel3 = [[Fumble|Forced fumbles]]\n| statvalue3 = 15\n| statlabel4 = [[Fumble|Fumble recoveries]]\n| statvalue4 = 5\n| statlabel5 = [[Pass deflected|Pass deflections]]\n| statvalue5 = 11\n| nflnew = aarondonald/2543485\n| pfr = DonaAa00\n}}\n\n'''Aaron Charles Donald''' (born May 23, 1991) is an [[American football]] [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played [[college football]] at [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]], where he was recognized as a unanimous [[All-America]]n. He was drafted by the Rams with the thirteenth pick in the first round of the [[2014 NFL Draft]]. He has been selected to six [[Pro Bowl]]s in his six years into the league, won the [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]] and has twice been named as the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year]], having won it back-to-back in 2017 and 2018.

His father Archie, whose football career ended due to a patellar fracture suffered while playing at [[Norfolk State Spartans football|Norfolk State]], introduced Aaron to strength training when he was 12, seeking to provide more structure in his son's life. Aaron himself would later admit that he was \"lazy as a kid\". By age 14, he and his father woke up at 4:30 am and almost immediately proceeded to work out for nearly two hours in the basement gym that Archie installed in the family home.<ref name=Gonzalez>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/los-angeles-rams/post/_/id/39627/how-rams-dt-aaron-donald-became-the-nfls-most-unstoppable-force |title=How Rams DT Aaron Donald became the NFL's most unstoppable force |first=Alden |last=Gonzalez |website=ESPN.com |date=January 12, 2019 |accessdate=January 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDonald attended [[Penn Hills High School]], where he played [[high school football]] for head coach Ron Graham.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://triblive.com/sports/nfl/14566877-74/penn-hills-cherishes-aaron-donald-as-he-prepares-for-super-bowl-debut |title=Penn Hills cherishes Aaron Donald as he prepares for Super Bowl debut |last=Divittorio |first=Michael |website=triblive.com |access-date=February 11, 2019}}</ref> He was selected first team All-State Class AAAA in each of his final two seasons, and compiled 63 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, and 11 sacks as a senior.

When Aaron was named Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2014, he bought his father a used truck; four years later, he bought his father a $40,000 [[Rolex]] watch as a birthday present. A few weeks after he signed his most recent contract extension, he set up both of his parents (who by that time had divorced) with retirement funds sufficient to allow both to permanently stop working, plus brand-new homes of their choosing. His father's new home was in [[Penn Hills Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], near Aaron's old high school. However, at Aaron's and Archie Jr.'s insistence, Archie Sr. never sold his old home.

They are excellent jumpers;  ''Osteoglossum'' species have been seen leaping more than 6&nbsp;ft (almost 2 m) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname \"water monkeys\". Arowana species typically grow to around 2 to 3&nbsp;ft in captivity.\n\nArowana is quite troublesome for a pet. They are expensive, require wide living space, are picky eaters and need a lot of care. Arowana is a [https://aboutfishtank.com/asian-arowana-the-dragon-fish-and-a-true-legend/ true legend] from the aquatic world with its aggressive behavior and sound personality.\n\nSeveral species of osteoglossids exhibit parental care. They build nests and protect their young after they hatch. All species are [[mouthbrooder]]s, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently.\n\nUnlike most fishes that start reproducing at around six months of age, the Arowana usually takes three to four years to reach sexual maturity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arowana - Description, Habitat, Image, Diet, and Interesting Facts |url=https://animals.net/arowana/ |publisher=Animals Network |accessdate=31 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==In the aquarium==\nDepending on the classification system used, there are 10 types of arowana commonly kept as pets; 4 from [[Asian arowana|Asia]], 3 from [[Osteoglossum|South America]], 2 from [[Scleropages|Australia]] and 1 from [[African arowana|Africa]].\n\n[[Asian arowana]] is an endangered species and banned in the United States. It is a status symbol among wealthy Asian men. An albino arowana sold for a record price of $300,000 in 2009. Most pet arowana are farmed behind high-security fences.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dragon Behind the Glass: A True Story of Power, Obsession, and the World's Most Coveted Fish |date=2017}}</ref>\n\nArowanas are solitary fish and only allow company while young; adults may show dominance and aggression.

Following the name change, Dempsey won six bouts in a row by [[knockout]] before losing on a disqualification in four rounds to Jack Downey. During this early part of his career, Dempsey campaigned in Utah, frequently entering fights in towns in the [[Wasatch range|Wasatch Mountain Range]] region.  He followed his loss against Downey with a knockout win and two draws versus Johnny Sudenberg in [[Nevada]]. Three more wins and a draw followed when he met Downey again, this time resulting in a four-round draw.  Following these wins, Dempsey racked up 10 more wins that included matches against Sudenberg and Downey, knocking out Downey in two rounds.  These wins were followed with three no-decision matches, although at this point in the history of boxing, the use of judges to score a fight was often forbidden, so if a fight went the distance, it was called a draw or a no decision, depending on the state or county where the fight was held.\n\nAfter the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Dempsey worked in a shipyard and continued to box. Afterward, he was accused by some boxing fans of being a [[slacker#World wars|slacker]] for not enlisting. This remained a black mark on his reputation until 1920, when evidence produced showed he had attempted to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]], but had been classified 4-F.<ref group=upper-alpha>According to This Draft Card https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/wwi-draft/dempsey.html</ref> After the war, Dempsey spent two years in [[Salt Lake City]], \"bumming around\" as he called it, before returning to the ring.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\">{{cite book |title=The 12 Greatest Rounds Of Boxing: The Untold Stories |first1=Ferdie |last1=Pacheco |date= 2005 |location=London|publisher=Robson, Trafalgar Square |page=208 |isbn=9781861058058}}</ref>\n\n===World heavyweight champion===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dempsey mock punching [[Harry Houdini]] (held back by [[Benny Leonard]])]]\nAmong his opponents as a rising contender were [[Fireman Jim Flynn]], the only boxer ever to beat Dempsey by a knockout when Dempsey lost to him in the first round (although some boxing historians believe the fight was a \"fix\"),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/dempsey_dive.html |first1=Monte |last1=Cox |first2=Bob |last2=Soderman |title= Did Jack Dempsey Take a Dive? |publisher=Cox's Corner |accessdate= 16 July 2008}}</ref> and [[Gunboat Smith]], formerly a highly ranked contender who had beaten both World Champion [[Jess Willard]] and Hall of Famer [[Sam Langford]].

I sincerely wish Dempsey all the luck possible and hope that he garnishes all the riches that comes with the championship. I have had my fling with the title.

In the interview, Kearns claimed to have informed Dempsey  he had wagered his share of the purse favoring a Dempsey win with a first-round knockout.  Kearns further stated he had applied [[plaster of Paris]] to the wrappings on the fighter's hands.\n\nBoxing historian [[J. J. Johnston]] said, \"the films show Willard upon entering the ring walking over to Dempsey and examining his hands.\" That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns' story was false.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine founder and editor [[Nat Fleischer]] claimed to be present when Dempsey's hands were wrapped, stating, \"Jack Dempsey had no loaded gloves, and no plaster of Paris over his bandages. I watched the proceedings and the only person who had anything to do with the taping of Jack's hands was Deforest. Kearns had nothing to do with it, so his plaster of Paris story is simply not true.\"\n\nDeforest himself said that he regarded the stories of Dempsey's gloves being loaded as libel, calling them \"trash\", and said he did not apply any foreign substance to them, which I can verify since I watched the taping.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Nat |authorlink=Nat Fleischer|title=50 Years At Ringside|location=New York |publisher=Fleet Publishing Corp |year=1958 |page=118}}</ref> [[Sports writer]] [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], in Dempsey's obituary published by ''The New York Times''' was openly dismissive of the claim.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0624.html |date=June 1, 1983 |title=OBITUARY: Jack Dempsey, 87, is Dead; Boxing Champion of 1920s |first1=Red |last1=Smith |authorlink1=Red Smith (sportswriter) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother rumor is that Dempsey used a [[knuckleduster]] during the first round.  Some speculated that the object used was a [[rail spike]].<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/> In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on July 3, 1979, Joe Stone, an ex-referee and boxing writer, asserted that in a film taken of the fight an object on the canvas could be seen after the final knockdown. He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey's corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey can be seen at various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard with the palm of the glove in question and holding on to the ropes with both hands, making it next to impossible that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove, and the 'object' resembles a cigar.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\nFurther controversy was fueled by the fact that Dempsey left the ring at the end of the first round, thinking the fight was over. This was seen as a violation of the rules, however Willard's corner did not ask for enforcement in order for the referee to disqualify Dempsey.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\n===Title defenses===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey v Georges Carpentier cph.3b35134.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dempsey and Carpentier in the arena before the fight]]\nFollowing his victory, Jack Dempsey traveled around the country, making publicity appearances with circuses, staging exhibitions, and appearing in a low-budget Hollywood movie. Dempsey did not defend his title until September 1920, with a fight against [[Billy Miske]] in [[Benton Harbor]], Michigan. Miske was knocked out in three rounds.\n\nDempsey's second title defense was in December 1920 against Bill Brennan at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]], [[New York City]]. After 10 rounds, Brennan was ahead on points, and Dempsey's left ear was bleeding profusely.

A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner.  Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover.  Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee's count of 9.  Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so.  Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of World Heavyweight Champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |title=Jack Dempsey \u2013 The Idol of Fistiana |first= Nat |last= Fleischer |chapter= Ch. 63: Drama of the Long Count |accessdate= 30 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314164236/http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |archivedate= 14 March 2007 |publisher= C.

He first competed as \"Jack Dempsey\" (by his own recollection) in the fall of 1914, in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]]. His brother, Bernie, who often fought under the pseudonym, \"Jack Dempsey\"\u2014this a common practice of the day, in fighters' admiration of [[middleweight]] boxer and former champion, [[Jack \"Nonpareil\" Dempsey]]\u2014had signed to fight veteran George Copelin. Upon learning Copelin had sparred with then current world heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], and given Bernie Dempsey was nearing 40 years of age, he strategically decided to back out of the fight.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Toby|title=Kid Blackie|date=1987|publisher=Wayfinder Press|location=Ouray, CO|isbn=0-9608764-7-2|page=79|ref=harv}}</ref> He substituted his brother, still unknown in Eastern Colorado, as \"Jack Dempsey\". The fans at ringside immediately knew this was not the man they'd paid to see.\n\nThe promoter became violently angry and \"sailed into us, barehanded\", threatening to stop the fight.<ref name=\"Round by Round An Autobiography\"/> Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, \"I might kill that skinny guy.\" The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as \"Jack Dempsey\", the future champion downed Copelin six times in the first round and twice in the second.{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=49}} From there, it was a battle of attrition (\"Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek.\"), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. According to Dempsey \"In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move.\"{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=50}} This trial by fire carried with it a $100 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, \"...and even if I did, I wouldn't give you anything.\"{{sfnp|Smith|1987|p=82}}\n\nSuch lessons were hard, but fighting was something Jack Dempsey did well. Following the name change, Dempsey won six bouts in a row by [[knockout]] before losing on a disqualification in four rounds to Jack Downey. During this early part of his career, Dempsey campaigned in Utah, frequently entering fights in towns in the [[Wasatch range|Wasatch Mountain Range]] region.  He followed his loss against Downey with a knockout win and two draws versus Johnny Sudenberg in [[Nevada]]. Three more wins and a draw followed when he met Downey again, this time resulting in a four-round draw.  Following these wins, Dempsey racked up 10 more wins that included matches against Sudenberg and Downey, knocking out Downey in two rounds.  These wins were followed with three no-decision matches, although at this point in the history of boxing, the use of judges to score a fight was often forbidden, so if a fight went the distance, it was called a draw or a no decision, depending on the state or county where the fight was held.\n\nAfter the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Dempsey worked in a shipyard and continued to box. Afterward, he was accused by some boxing fans of being a [[slacker#World wars|slacker]] for not enlisting. This remained a black mark on his reputation until 1920, when evidence produced showed he had attempted to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]], but had been classified 4-F.<ref group=upper-alpha>According to This Draft Card https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/wwi-draft/dempsey.html</ref> After the war, Dempsey spent two years in [[Salt Lake City]], \"bumming around\" as he called it, before returning to the ring.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\">{{cite book |title=The 12 Greatest Rounds Of Boxing: The Untold Stories |first1=Ferdie |last1=Pacheco |date= 2005 |location=London|publisher=Robson, Trafalgar Square |page=208 |isbn=9781861058058}}</ref>\n\n===World heavyweight champion===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dempsey mock punching [[Harry Houdini]] (held back by [[Benny Leonard]])]]\nAmong his opponents as a rising contender were [[Fireman Jim Flynn]], the only boxer ever to beat Dempsey by a knockout when Dempsey lost to him in the first round (although some boxing historians believe the fight was a \"fix\"),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/dempsey_dive.html |first1=Monte |last1=Cox |first2=Bob |last2=Soderman |title= Did Jack Dempsey Take a Dive? |publisher=Cox's Corner |accessdate= 16 July 2008}}</ref> and [[Gunboat Smith]], formerly a highly ranked contender who had beaten both World Champion [[Jess Willard]] and Hall of Famer [[Sam Langford]].

It was the first time that I had ever been knocked off my feet. I have sent many birds home in the same bruised condition that I am in, and now I know how they felt. I sincerely wish Dempsey all the luck possible and hope that he garnishes all the riches that comes with the championship. I have had my fling with the title.

I have invested the money I have made\".<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>  Willard later claimed to have been defeated by \"[[gangsterism]]\".<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\nAfter being fired by Dempsey, manager Jack Kearns gave an account of the fight in the January 20, 1964 issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that has become known as the \"loaded gloves theory\".  In the interview, Kearns claimed to have informed Dempsey  he had wagered his share of the purse favoring a Dempsey win with a first-round knockout.  Kearns further stated he had applied [[plaster of Paris]] to the wrappings on the fighter's hands.\n\nBoxing historian [[J. J. Johnston]] said, \"the films show Willard upon entering the ring walking over to Dempsey and examining his hands.\" That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns' story was false.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine founder and editor [[Nat Fleischer]] claimed to be present when Dempsey's hands were wrapped, stating, \"Jack Dempsey had no loaded gloves, and no plaster of Paris over his bandages. I watched the proceedings and the only person who had anything to do with the taping of Jack's hands was Deforest. Kearns had nothing to do with it, so his plaster of Paris story is simply not true.\"\n\nDeforest himself said that he regarded the stories of Dempsey's gloves being loaded as libel, calling them \"trash\", and said he did not apply any foreign substance to them, which I can verify since I watched the taping.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Nat |authorlink=Nat Fleischer|title=50 Years At Ringside|location=New York |publisher=Fleet Publishing Corp |year=1958 |page=118}}</ref> [[Sports writer]] [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], in Dempsey's obituary published by ''The New York Times''' was openly dismissive of the claim.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0624.html |date=June 1, 1983 |title=OBITUARY: Jack Dempsey, 87, is Dead; Boxing Champion of 1920s |first1=Red |last1=Smith |authorlink1=Red Smith (sportswriter) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother rumor is that Dempsey used a [[knuckleduster]] during the first round.  Some speculated that the object used was a [[rail spike]].<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/> In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on July 3, 1979, Joe Stone, an ex-referee and boxing writer, asserted that in a film taken of the fight an object on the canvas could be seen after the final knockdown. He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey's corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey can be seen at various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard with the palm of the glove in question and holding on to the ropes with both hands, making it next to impossible that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove, and the 'object' resembles a cigar.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\nFurther controversy was fueled by the fact that Dempsey left the ring at the end of the first round, thinking the fight was over. This was seen as a violation of the rules, however Willard's corner did not ask for enforcement in order for the referee to disqualify Dempsey.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\n===Title defenses===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey v Georges Carpentier cph.3b35134.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dempsey and Carpentier in the arena before the fight]]\nFollowing his victory, Jack Dempsey traveled around the country, making publicity appearances with circuses, staging exhibitions, and appearing in a low-budget Hollywood movie. Dempsey did not defend his title until September 1920, with a fight against [[Billy Miske]] in [[Benton Harbor]], Michigan.

Generating more interest than the Carpentier and Firpo bouts, the fight brought in a record-setting $2 million gate. Reportedly, gangster [[Al Capone]] offered to fix the rematch in his favor, but the referee was changed to prevent that from happening.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Listed|first1=Not|title=1927 Dempsey loses on long count|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dempsey-loses-on-long-count|website=History.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC|accessdate=16 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323214646/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dempsey-loses-on-long-count|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Millions around the country listened to the match by radio while hundreds of reporters covered the event.

Today's equivalent in U.S currency would be approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1927|r=0}}}}.00.{{inflation-fn|US}}\n\nDempsey was losing the fight on points when in the seventh round he knocked Tunney down with a left hook to the chin then landed several more punches. A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner.  Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover.  Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee's count of 9.  Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so.  Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of World Heavyweight Champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |title=Jack Dempsey \u2013 The Idol of Fistiana |first= Nat |last= Fleischer |chapter= Ch. 63: Drama of the Long Count |accessdate= 30 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314164236/http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |archivedate= 14 March 2007 |publisher= C.
