Photo: J.M. Oliveras]]\n==Origin==\nOn April 8, 1998, the Museu de Cinema \u2013 Col\u2022lecci\u00f3 Tom\u00e0s Mallol was opened in the city of Girona. This museum is unique in its field in Spain and one of the few of its kind in Europe. \nThe origin of the Museu de Cinema must be found in the labour of Tom\u00e0s Mallol (born in Sant Pere Pescador, Catalonia, in 1923), in his passion for art and especially cinema technique, which arose in him at an early age with open-air projections in the main square of his home town. An amateur filmmaker, from 1956 to 1977 Tom\u00e0s Mallol made 31 short films, some of which won awards in Spain and Internationally in the middle of the 1960s, he began to collect various cinema instruments that would later become the nucleus of his collection. This was also the time he began his intense activity of researching and see\u00acking out objects of interest. This would lead him over a period of more than 30 years to build a collection related to pre-cinema and cinema from the earliest years that is now recognized as the most important in Spain and one of the most outstanding in Europe. In January, 1994, the City of Girona acquired this collection with the goal of making it into the foundation of the Museu de Cinema - Col\u2022lecci\u00f3 Tom\u00e0s Mallol, which is located in a three-floor building of almost 3000 square metres that is found in the centre of Girona.\n\n==Tom\u00e0s Mallol Collection==\nCurrently the Tom\u00e0s Mallol Collection is made up of approximately 12,000 pieces, including instruments, accessories, photographs, engravings and paintings, along with 2000 posters and film publicity material, 800 books and magazines and 750 films in all formats. These objects can be set into a chronological period that runs from the seventeenth century to 1970. The collection features important objects from the history of pre-cinema and [[early cinema]] that are absolutely unique. Yet what really makes it exceptional is that it allows us to follow and understand the history of images and the evolution of audiovisual spectacles step by step, from [[Chinese shadow theatre]] puppets to the first years of cinema\n\n[[File:Museu del Cinema interior.jpg|thumb|400px|Permanent exhibition. Cinema Museum in Girona. Photo: J.M. Oliveras]]\n==Permanent Exhibition==\nThe visit through the 1500 square metres of exhibition space begins on the lower floor, with an audiovisual display that works as a prologue. The background voice of a generic spectator tells us how over time he has always been surprised and fascinated by the multitude of visual spectacles that have taken place, each with different techni\u00acques, increasingly complex. It then invites visitors, spectators like him, to enter into the permanent exhibition, where they will embark on a journey through 400 years of the history of images and relive the emotions that our ancestors experienced in viewing them. \n\n[[File:Museu del Cinema interior 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Cinema Museum in Girona. Photo: J.M. Oliveras]]\n\nThe first section, on the third floor, is dedicated to [[Chinese shadow theatre]] puppets, an art with ancestral origins: for the first time light, darkness and the screen were used to create the spectacle. Next, in the interior of a room without light the [[camera obscura]] allows us to see the reflection of the exterior images of the world, and understand why this phenomenon is the basis on which the technique of photography and cinema is founded. The next section is dedicated to mirrors, which allowed us to capture ephemeral images of the world generating optical games that drew the attention of science and the esoteric interests of the past \nFollowing on this, we observe one of the essential sections of the museum, dedicated to the [[magic lantern]]. Two hundred years before the invention of cinema, the magic lantern converted the projection of images into a form of mass entertainment for the first time, providing information and serving as an educational tool. The magic lantern is the clearest precedent of cinema both as technique and as spectacle. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, instruments were built to enable the human hand to fix the images captured by the camera obscura. The exhibition shows what these tools were, the resulting images and how they could be observed by means of [[peep show]] or the Mondo Nuovo, a travelling show that introduced viewers to far-off cities and landscapes without leaving their homes. Afterwards, the visitor can see how [[photography]] was able to reproduce precise images of reality, thanks to advances in chemistry and the camera obscura. \nNow on the second floor, the exhibition continues with instruments based on the principle of the [[persistence of vision]] that began to generate the illusion of moving Images, even though they were simply drawings that were animated through repetitive movements After this, we enter into the section dedicated to the definitive path towards cinema as we know it, when in the twenty years preceding its invention scientists the world over began an increasingly accelerated race towards the discovery of the projection of photographic images in movement. Finally, the visitor comes to a space that refers to the historical moment itself, on December 28, 1895. On that day, in the Salon Indien, found in the cellar of the Grand Caf\u00e9 in Paris, the [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] offe\u00acred the first paid public projection with an instrument of their own invention the [[cinematograph]]. From that moment onwards we move into the first years of cinema, beginning with the magician [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]], who discovered its illusory possibilities through the introduction of image manipulation. The section also looks at the rapid spread of cinema throughout the world, its technological evolution, how it began to create its own language until becoming a new art and a new industry, and, finally, how starting with the 1930s it would be faced with a competitor: [[television]]. At the end of this space, one audiovisual presentation invites us to contemplate representative ima\u00acges of 100 years of cinema, while another looks at the way a film is made in our day. \nOn the first floor, at the end of the visit, we find two examples of how the magic of cinema pertains to amateurs and children as well. Instruments related to amateur film from the early period and to children's cinema, especially with the popular Cine NIC, are shown in these final metres of the permanent exhibition \nThe exhibition concept is not limited to merely setting out the most important parts of the Tom\u00e0s Mallol Collection (with nearly 1500 objects on display). It also seeks to work as an Interactive display that is friendly and educational. For this reason, various audiovisual and theatrical projections are set into the visit (giving us an idea of what early visual spectacles were like), along with replicas of the objects shown so that visitors can handle them, understand how they once worked and see the images they would produce. \nAll told this ensures that the exhibition, through the themes it deals with and the way it is presented, is ideal for all kinds of visitors, regardless of age, educational level, nationality, cultural background, language or interest in cinema. It is a universal discourse allowing everyone to enjoy this world of images.\n\n[[File:Museu del Cinema servei educatiu.jpg|thumb|300px|Educational service. Cinema Museum in Girona. Photo: J.M. Oliveras]]\n\n==Objectives and services==\nNevertheless, the global objective of the Museu de Cinema goes beyond the permanent display of the Tomas Mallol Collection. Its aim is to encourage wider knowledge, learning and research in the field of cinema and of images in general. So as to achieve this goal the museum has various services directed to its potential users, including an ongoing programming of temporary exhibitions and activities, an educational service with a generous program of visits, workshops and film-related activities for schools, the Institut d'Estudis (research institute) with its specialized library, videotheque and consultation service related to the museum's holdings, the friends of the museum, called the Club de Actors, and the museum shop, amongst others. \nNow that cinema has entered into the second century of its life, the Museu de Cinema presents itself as an homage to all those men and women who, through their efforts and creativity, made it possible to fascinate audiences by means of moving ima\u00acges. The Museu is also there in support of the future of audiovisual communication media, whose development is in constant evolution.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Museu del Cinema (Girona)}}\n* {{in lang|ca|es|en|fr}} [http://www.museudelcinema.cat Official website of Cinema Museum] \n* Official website of Cinema Museum in [http://visitmuseum.gencat.cat/en/museu-del-cinema-col-leccio-tomas-mallol/ VisitMuseum], the museums of Catalonia on the mobile device \n\n[[Category:Cinema museums]]\n[[Category:Cinema museums in Catalonia]]\n[[Category:Museums in Girona]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox museum\n| name = Museum of Cinema-Tom\u00e0s Mallol collection\n| native_name = Museu del Cinema-Col\u00b7lecci\u00f3 Tom\u00e0s Mallol\n| logo = \n| image = Museu del Cinema fa\u00e7ana.jpg\n| map_type = Spain Catalonia\n| former_name = \n| established = 08-04-1998\n| location = [[Pl.

The Royal Navy captured her in March 1799, only to have the French recapture her the next month. The British recaptured her in 1800, returned her to service, but sold her in 1801.\n\n==French career==\nBetween 28 August 1794 and 11 December, ''Foudre'' was under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu'' Lambert, and escorting a convoy from [[Saint-Malo]] to [[Saint-Valery-sur-Somme]].<ref>Fonds Marine, 1790-1804, p.95.</ref> From there between 14 January 1795 and 14 June, she escorted convoys between Cherbourg and Boulogne, before returning to Havre.<ref>Fonds Marine, 1790-1804, p.152.</ref> Afound April 1796 she escorted a convoy from Dieppe to Saint-Valery-sur-Somme.<ref>Fonds Marine, 1790-1804, p.184.</ref>\n\n==Capture==\n''Foudre'' was one of a flotilla of seven vessels that Commodore Sir [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sidney Smith]] in {{HMS|Tigre|1795|6}} took at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 18 March 1799, all of which the British took into service. At capture ''Foudre'' carried six guns and had a crew of 52 men.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15149|pages=609\u2013610|date=18 June 1799}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|List of gun-vessels Commodore Sir Sidney Smith captured at Acre in March 1799}}\n\nThe flotilla of gun-vessels was carrying [[Siege engine|siege artillery]] and other siege supplies to reinforce Napoleon's troops besieging Acre. Smith immediately put the guns and supplies to use to help the denizens of the city resist the French, and the gun-vessels to harass them.\n\n{{main|Siege of Acre (1799)}}\n\nSmith anchored ''Tigre'' and [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']], one on each side of the town, so their broadsides could assist the defence. The gun-vessels were of shallower draft and so could come in closer. Together, they helped repel repeated French assaults.{{sfnp|Shankland|1975|p=70}} The French attacked multiple times between 19 March and 10 May before Napoleon finally gave up. On 21 May he destroyed his siege train and retreated back to Egypt, having lost 2,200 men dead, 1,000 of them to the plague.{{sfnp|Pawley|2006|p=6}}\n\n==Recapture==\n\nHowever, on 9 April, the French frigate [[French frigate Courageuse (1778)|''Courageuse'']] recaptured ''Foudre'' and the French navy took her back into service.<ref name=\"fonds229\">''Fonds Marine'', p.229.</ref>\n\n==Re-recapture==\nThen in 1800 the Royal Navy recaptured her and returned her to service as HMS ''Foudre''.
