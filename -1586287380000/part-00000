Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold to the Butchers to be cut up and sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop\nand ask for steak \u2013 chops \u2013 or stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price. John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them \u2013 tortured them \u2013 to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11 yr old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head \u2013 bones and guts. He was roasted in the oven, (all of his ass) boiled, broiled, fried, stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time I was living at 409 E 100 St, rear \u2013 right side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3 \u2013 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheese \u2013 strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her, on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick \u2013 bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me 9 days to eat her entire body. I did not fuck her, though, I could of [''sic''] had I wished.

He failed to return home after playing catch with friends in the [[Port Richmond, Staten Island|Port Richmond]] neighbourhood of Staten Island. A search was organised and his body was found\u2014hanging by a tree\u2014in a wooded area near his home. He had been [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]], then [[strangulation|strangled]] with his suspenders.<ref name=\"Schechter\"/> According to an [[autopsy]], McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left [[hamstring]] had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh. Fish refused to claim responsibility for this, although he later stated that he intended to [[castration|castrate]] the boy but fled when he heard someone approaching the area.\n\nMcDonnell's friends told the police that he was taken by an elderly man with a grey moustache. A neighbour also told the police he observed the boy with a similar-looking man walking along a grassy path into the nearby woods.<ref name=\"Schechter\"/> Francis' mother, Anna McDonnell, said she saw the same man earlier that day. She told the reporters, \"He came shuffling down the street mumbling to himself and making queer motions with his hands ... I saw his thick grey hair and his drooping grey moustache. Everything about him seemed faded and grey.\"<ref name=\"Schechter\"/>\n\nThis description resulted in the mysterious stranger becoming known as \"The Grey Man\". The McDonnell murder remained unsolved until the murder of Grace Budd.<ref name=\"Schechter\"/> When several eyewitnesses, among them the Staten Island farmer Hans Kiel, positively identified Albert Fish as the odd stranger seen around Port Richmond on the day of McDonnell's disappearance, [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas J. Walsh (New York)|Thomas J. Walsh]] announced his intention to seek an [[indictment]] against Fish for the boy's murder. At first, Fish denied the charges. It was only in March 1935, after the conclusion of his trial for the Budd murder and his confession to the killing of Billy Gaffney, that Fish confirmed to investigators that he also raped and murdered McDonnell. When the McDonnell confession was made public, the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the disclosure solidified Fish's reputation as \"the most vicious child-slayer in criminal history\".<ref name=\"Schechter\"/>\n\n===Billy Gaffney===\nOn February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old brother were playing in the apartment hallway in [[Brooklyn]] with 4-year-old Billy Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later on the roof of the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said \"the [[bogeyman]] took him.\" Gaffney's body was never recovered.<ref>Billy Gaffney's parents were Edward and Elizabeth Gaffney.</ref> \n\nInitially, serial killer [[Peter Kudzinowski]] was a suspect in the boy's murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a [[Brooklyn]] [[tram|trolley]], saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the old man had been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton's description of the \"bogeyman\" matched Fish.<ref>''The Charley Project'' page on [http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/g/gaffney_billy.html Billy Gaffney] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101164117/http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/g/gaffney_billy.html |date=January 1, 2010 }}.

Then I walked back and took trolley to 59 St. at 2 A.M. and walked home from there. Next day about 2 P.M., I took tools, a good heavy [[cat o' nine tails|cat-of-nine tails]]. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these half in six strips about 8 in. long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears&nbsp;\u2013 nose&nbsp;\u2013 [[Glasgow smile|slit his mouth from ear to ear]]. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him thru the middle of his body. Just below his belly button. Then thru his legs about 2 in. below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head&nbsp;\u2013 feet&nbsp;\u2013 arms&nbsp;\u2013 hands and the legs below the knee.

I came home with my meat. I had the front of his body I liked best. His monkey and pee wees and a nice little fat behind to roast in the oven and eat. I made a stew out of his ears&nbsp;\u2013 nose&nbsp;\u2013 pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when meat had roasted about 1/4 hr., I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hr., it was nice and brown, cooked thru. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was as sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew. Threw them in the toilet.}}\n\nGaffney's mother Elizabeth visited Fish in Sing Sing, accompanied by Detective King and two other men. She wanted to ask him about her son's death, but Fish refused to speak to her. Fish began to weep and asked to be left alone. After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Fish was her son's killer.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Trial and execution==\nAlbert Fish's trial for the murder of Grace Budd began on March 11, 1935, in [[White Plains, New York]]. Frederick P. Close presided as judge and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] Chief Assistant District Attorney Elbert F. Gallagher was prosecuting attorney. Fish's defense counsel was James Dempsey, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of [[Peekskill, New York]]. The trial lasted for 10 days. Fish pleaded [[insanity]], and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several [[psychiatrist]]s testified about Fish's [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], which included [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], [[flagellation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[voyeurism]], [[piquerism]], [[cannibalism]], [[coprophagia]], [[Urolagnia|urophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and [[infibulation]]. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a \"psychiatric phenomenon\" and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities.<ref name=\"Schechter\" />\n\nThe defense's chief expert witness was [[Fredric Wertham]], a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1\u201324). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly \"sacrificing\" a boy would be [[penance]] for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Wertham then detailed Fish's [[cannibalism]], which in his mind he associated with [[Communion rite|communion]]. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered \"He is insane\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an \"insane knowledge\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Fish Held Insane By Three Experts.

He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not \"mentally sick\" and that these were common perversions that were \"socially perfectly alright\" and that Fish was \"no different from millions of other people\", some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the \"very same\" perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at [[The Tombs]], Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, \"That is not masochism\", as he was only \"punishing himself to get sexual gratification\". The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but \"was a matter of taste\" and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.<ref name=\"crimelibrary\" /><!--{{quotation|He went into his room and he had a little pair of trunks, brown trunks, that he put on.

Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold to the Butchers to be cut up and sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop\nand ask for steak \u2013 chops \u2013 or stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price. John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them \u2013 tortured them \u2013 to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11 yr old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head \u2013 bones and guts. He was roasted in the oven, (all of his ass) boiled, broiled, fried, stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time I was living at 409 E 100 St, rear \u2013 right side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3 \u2013 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheese \u2013 strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her, on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick \u2013 bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven.

He had been sexually assaulted, then strangled with his suspenders.<ref name=\"Schechter\"/> According to an autopsy, McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left [[hamstring]] had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh. Fish refused to claim responsibility for this, although he later stated that he intended to castrate the boy but fled when he heard someone approaching the area.\n\nMcDonnell's friends told the police that he was taken by an elderly man with a grey moustache. A neighbour also told the police he observed the boy with a similar-looking man walking along a grassy path into the nearby woods.<ref name=\"Schechter\"/> Francis' mother, Anna McDonnell, said she saw the same man earlier that day. She told the reporters, \"He came shuffling down the street mumbling to himself and making queer motions with his hands ... I saw his thick grey hair and his drooping grey moustache. Everything about him seemed faded and grey.\"<ref name=\"Schechter\"/>\n\nThis description resulted in the mysterious stranger becoming known as \"The Grey Man\". The McDonnell murder remained unsolved until the murder of Grace Budd.<ref name=\"Schechter\"/> When several eyewitnesses, among them the Staten Island farmer Hans Kiel, positively identified Albert Fish as the odd stranger seen around Port Richmond on the day of Francis McDonnell's disappearance, [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas J. Walsh (New York)|Thomas J. Walsh]] announced his intention to seek an indictment against Fish for the boy's murder. At first, Fish denied the charges. It was only in March 1935, after the conclusion of his trial for the Budd murder and his confession to the killing of Billy Gaffney, that Fish confirmed to investigators that he also raped and murdered Francis McDonnell. When the McDonnell confession was made public, the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the disclosure solidified Fish's reputation as \"the most vicious child-slayer in criminal history\".<ref name=\"Schechter\"/>\n\n===Billy Gaffney===\nOn February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old brother were playing in the apartment hallway in [[Brooklyn]] with 4-year-old Billy Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later on the roof of the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said \"the [[bogeyman]] took him.\" Gaffney's body was never recovered.<ref>Billy Gaffney's parents were Edward and Elizabeth Gaffney.</ref> Initially, serial killer [[Peter Kudzinowski]] was a suspect in the boy's murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a [[Brooklyn]] [[tram|trolley]], saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the old man had been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton's description of the \"bogeyman\" matched Fish.<ref>''The Charley Project'' page on [http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/g/gaffney_billy.html Billy Gaffney] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101164117/http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/g/gaffney_billy.html |date=January 1, 2010 }}.

Then I walked back and took trolley to 59 St. at 2 A.M. and walked home from there. Next day about 2 P.M., I took tools, a good heavy [[cat o' nine tails|cat-of-nine tails]]. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these half in six strips about 8 in. long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears&nbsp;\u2013 nose&nbsp;\u2013 [[Glasgow smile|slit his mouth from ear to ear]]. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him thru the middle of his body. Just below his belly button. Then thru his legs about 2 in. below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head&nbsp;\u2013 feet&nbsp;\u2013 arms&nbsp;\u2013 hands and the legs below the knee.

I made a stew out of his ears&nbsp;\u2013 nose&nbsp;\u2013 pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when meat had roasted about 1/4 hr., I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hr., it was nice and brown, cooked thru. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was as sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew.

She wanted to ask him about her son's death, but Fish refused to speak to her. Fish began to weep and asked to be left alone. After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Trial and execution==\nAlbert Fish's trial for the murder of Grace Budd began on March 11, 1935, in [[White Plains, New York]]. Frederick P. Close presided as judge and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] Chief Assistant District Attorney Elbert F. Gallagher was prosecuting attorney. Fish's defense counsel was James Dempsey, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of [[Peekskill, New York]]. The trial lasted for 10 days. Fish pleaded [[insanity]], and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several [[psychiatrist]]s testified about Fish's [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], which included [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], [[flagellation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[voyeurism]], [[piquerism]], [[cannibalism]], [[coprophagia]], [[Urolagnia|urophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and [[infibulation]]. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a \"psychiatric phenomenon\" and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities.<ref name=\"Schechter\" />\n\nThe defense's chief expert witness was [[Fredric Wertham]], a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1\u201324). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly \"sacrificing\" a boy would be [[penance]] for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Wertham then detailed Fish's [[cannibalism]], which in his mind he associated with [[Communion rite|communion]]. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered \"He is insane\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an \"insane knowledge\".<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Fish Held Insane By Three Experts.

He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not \"mentally sick\" and that these were common perversions that were \"socially perfectly alright\" and that Fish was \"no different from millions of other people\", some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the \"very same\" perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at [[The Tombs]], Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, \"That is not masochism\", as he was only \"punishing himself to get sexual gratification\". The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but \"was a matter of taste\" and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion.<ref name=\"Schechter\" /> Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.<ref name=\"crimelibrary\" /><!--{{quotation|He went into his room and he had a little pair of trunks, brown trunks, that he put on.

Following the advice of his mentor [[Vilhelm Thomsen]], he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English [[Grammatical case|case]] system. He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891.\n\n==Academic life and work==\nJespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925, and served as Rector of the university in 1920\u201321. His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics, but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development.\n\nHe advanced the theories of ''Rank'' and ''[[Nexus grammar|Nexus]]'' in Danish in two papers: ''Sprogets logik'' (1913) and ''De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser'' (1921). Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax, and differentiates between  primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries; e.g. in \"''well honed phrase'',\" \"phrase\" is a primary, this being defined by a secondary, \"honed\", which again is defined by a tertiary \"well\". The term ''Nexus'' is applied to sentences, structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation, in which two concepts are expressed in one unit; e.g., ''it rained, he ran indoors''. This term is qualified by a further concept called a ''junction'' which represents one idea, expressed by means of two or more elements, whereas a nexus combines two ideas.  Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics.\n\nHe was most widely recognized for some of his books. ''Language: Its Nature, Development and Origin'' (1922) is considered by many to be his masterpiece.<ref>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/al/research/collect/elt_archive/halloffame/jespersen/life</ref> ''Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles'' (1909\u20131949), concentrated on morphology and syntax, and ''Growth and Structure of the English Language'' (1905) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language, and still in print, over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication. Late in his life he published ''Analytic Syntax'' (1937), in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation. In ''The Philosophy of Grammar'' (1924) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in [[Grammar]] and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of [[grammatical case]], [[pronoun]], [[object (grammar)|object]], [[voice (grammar)|voice]] etc., and developed further his notions of ''Rank'' and ''Nexus''. In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern [[Structural linguistics]]. ''Mankind, Nation and Individual: from a linguistic point of view'' (1925) is one of the pioneering works on [[Sociolinguistics]].\n\nJespersen visited the United States twice: he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904, and in 1909\u20131910 he visited both the [[University of California]] and [[Columbia University]].<ref>Falk, Julia S. 1992.

In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages,<ref>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/al/research/collect/elt_archive/halloffame/jespersen/life</ref> and in 1887 earned his master's degree in [[French language|French]], with English and [[Latin]] as his secondary languages.

This is the result of a wholesale reorientation of trade toward the West and the growing markets of central and eastern Europe in the face of the collapse of its Yugoslav markets. Slovenia's economy is highly dependent on foreign trade. Trade equals about 120% of GDP ([[exports]] and [[imports]] combined).{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} About two-thirds of Slovenia's trade is with other EU members.\n\nThis high level of openness makes it extremely sensitive to economic conditions in its main trading partners and changes in its international price competitiveness. However, despite the economic slowdown in Europe in 2001\u201303, Slovenia maintained a 3% GDP growth. Keeping labour costs in line with productivity is thus a key challenge for Slovenia's economic well-being, and Slovenian firms have responded by specializing in mid- to high-tech manufacturing. Industry and construction comprise about one quarter of GDP. As in most industrial economies, services make up an increasing share of output (57.1 percent), notably in financial services.\n\n==Economic performance==\nThe traditional primary industries of [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[fishing]] comprise a comparatively low 2.5 percent of GDP and engage only 6 percent of the population. The average farm is only 5.5 hectares. Part of Slovenia lies in the [[Alpe-Adria]] [[bioregion]], which is currently involved in a major initiative in [[organic farming]]. Between 1998 and 2003, the organic sector grew from less than 0.1% of Slovenian agriculture to roughly the European Union average of 3.3%.<ref>[http://www.foodfirst.org/pubs/backgrdrs/2004/s04v10n3.html Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy | For Land, Liberty, Jobs and Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112222819/http://www.foodfirst.org/pubs/backgrdrs/2004/s04v10n3.html |date=12 November 2004 }}</ref>\n\nPublic finances have shown a deficit in recent years.

Its [[privatization]] process favoured insider purchasers and prescribed long lag time on share trading, complicated by a cultural wariness of being \"bought up\" by foreigners. As such, Slovenia has had a number of impediments to foreign participation in its economy. Slovenia has garnered some notable foreign investments, including the investment of $125 million by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] in 1997. At the end of 2008 there was around $11.5 billion of foreign capital in Slovenia. Slovenians had invested $7.5 billion abroad. As of 31 December 2007, the value of shares listed on the [[Ljubljana Stock Exchange]] was $29 billion.\n\nInvestments from neighboring Croatia have begun in Slovenia.

This is the result of a wholesale reorientation of trade toward the West and the growing markets of central and eastern Europe in the face of the collapse of its Yugoslav markets. Slovenia's economy is highly dependent on foreign trade. Trade equals about 120% of GDP ([[exports]] and [[imports]] combined).{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} About two-thirds of Slovenia's trade is with other EU members.\n\nThis high level of openness makes it extremely sensitive to economic conditions in its main trading partners and changes in its international price competitiveness. However, despite the economic slowdown in Europe in 2001-03, Slovenia maintained a 3% GDP growth. Keeping labour costs in line with productivity is thus a key challenge for Slovenia's economic well-being, and Slovenian firms have responded by specializing in mid- to high-tech manufacturing. Industry and construction comprise about one quarter of GDP. As in most industrial economies, services make up an increasing share of output (57.1 percent), notably in financial services.\n\n==Economic performance==\nThe traditional primary industries of [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[fishing]] comprise a comparatively low 2.5 percent of GDP and engage only 6 percent of the population. The average farm is only 5.5 hectares. Part of Slovenia lies in the [[Alpe-Adria]] [[bioregion]], which is currently involved in a major initiative in [[organic farming]]. Between 1998 and 2003, the organic sector grew from less than 0.1% of Slovenian agriculture to roughly the European Union average of 3.3%.<ref>[http://www.foodfirst.org/pubs/backgrdrs/2004/s04v10n3.html Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy | For Land, Liberty, Jobs and Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112222819/http://www.foodfirst.org/pubs/backgrdrs/2004/s04v10n3.html |date=12 November 2004 }}</ref>\n\nPublic finances have shown a deficit in recent years.

However, the Slovenian financial newspaper [[Finance (newspaper)|Finance]] calculated in January 2011 that it is actually 22.4 billion euros or almost 63% of GDP, surpassing the limit of 60% allowed by the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.finance.si/300023/Kolik%B9en-je-dejansko-dr%BEavni-dolg-Slovenije |title=Kolik\u0161en je dejansko dr\u017eavni dolg Slovenije? |publisher=\u010casnik Finance |newspaper=Finance |date=14 January 2011 |first=Karel |last=Lipnik |author2=Monika Weiss}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/gospodarstvo/surs-vsi-dolgovi-drzave-znasajo-22-43-milijarde-evrov/248573 |title=SURS: Vsi dolgovi dr\u017eave zna\u0161ajo 22,43 milijarde evrov |trans-title=SURS: All the Debts of Slovenia Sum to 22.43 Billion Euros |language=Slovenian |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia |date=14 January 2011}}</ref> On 12 January 2011, the Slovenian [[Court of Audit of the Republic of Slovenia|Court of Audit]] rejected the data reported by the ministry as incorrect and demanded the dismissal of the finance minister [[Franc Kri\u017eani\u010d]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=s&id=1594731 |title=Auditing Body Demands Dismissal of Finance Minister |date=12 January 2011 |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency}}</ref>\n\nSlovenia's traditional anti-[[inflation]] policy relied heavily on capital inflow restrictions. Its [[privatization]] process favoured insider purchasers and prescribed long lag time on share trading, complicated by a cultural wariness of being \"bought up\" by foreigners. As such, Slovenia has had a number of impediments to foreign participation in its economy. Slovenia has garnered some notable foreign investments, including the investment of $125 million by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] in 1997. At the end of 2008 there was around $11.5 billion of foreign capital in Slovenia. Slovenians had invested $7.5 billion abroad. As of 31 December 2007, the value of shares listed on the [[Ljubljana Stock Exchange]] was $29 billion.\n\nInvestments from neighboring Croatia have begun in Slovenia. On 1 July 2010, Droga Kolinska was purchased by Atlantic Group of Croatia for 382 million euros. Mercator was sold to Croatia's Agrocor in June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/gospodarstvo/podjetja/mercator-prodan-agrokorju.html|title=Mercator prodan Agrokorju|first=Ma.

In 2013 (latest published data) direct foreign investments accounted for 24.7% of GDP of Slovenia. The most important investor countries are: [[Austria]] (33.6%), [[Switzerland]] (11.3%), [[Germany]] (10.4%), [[Italy]] (7.9%), [[Croatia]] (7.7%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgrt.gov.si/si/delovna_podrocja/internacionalizacija/tuje_neposredne_investicije/|title=Tuje neposredne investicije - Ministrstvo za gospodarski razvoj in tehnologijo|website=www.mgrt.gov.si}}</ref>\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1993\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1992&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=961&s=NGDP_RPCH,NGDP,NGDPPC,PCPIPCH,LUR,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=22&pr.y=11|format=|accessdate=2018-09-04|last=|date=|year=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1993\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in \u20ac<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|7.78 Bln.\n|10.52 Bln.\n|18.90 Bln.\n|29.23 Bln.\n|31.56 Bln.\n|35.15 Bln.\n|37.95 Bln.\n|36.17 Bln.\n|36.25 Bln.\n|36.90 Bln.\n|36.08 Bln.\n|36.24 Bln.\n|37.62 Bln.\n|38.84 Bln.\n|40.42 Bln.\n|43.28 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in \u20ac<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|3,908\n|5,289\n|9,509\n|14,630\n|15,751\n|17,486\n|18,879\n|17,795\n|17,710\n|17,997\n|17,551\n|17,601\n|18,250\n|18,826\n|19,581\n|20,949\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|2.8 %\n|4.1 %\n|4.2 %\n|4.0 %\n|5.7 %\n|6.9 %\n|3.3 %\n|\u22127.8 %\n|1.2 %\n|0.6 %\n|\u22122.7 %\n|\u22121.1 %\n|3.0 %\n|2.3 %\n|3.1 %\n|5.0 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|31.9 %\n|13.7 %\n|8.9 %\n|2.5 %\n|2.5 %\n|3.7 %\n|5.7 %\n|0.8 %\n|1.8 %\n|1.8 %\n|2.6 %\n|1.8 %\n|0.2 %\n|\u22120.5 %\n|\u22120.1 %\n|1.4 %\n|-\n|Unemployment rate<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|8.6 %\n|7.0 %\n|6.7 %\n|6.5 %\n|6.0 %\n|4.9 %\n|4.4 %\n|5.9 %\n|7.3 %\n|8.2 %\n|8.9 %\n|10.1 %\n|9.7 %\n|9.0 %\n|8.0 %\n|6.8 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|...\n|17 %\n|29 %\n|26 %\n|26 %\n|23 %\n|22 %\n|34 %\n|38 %\n|46 %\n|54 %\n|70 %\n|80 %\n|83 %\n|78 %\n|75 %\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of banks in Slovenia]]\n*[[List of companies of Slovenia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Slovenia topics}}\n{{Members_of_the_European_Union_(EU)}}\n{{Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}\n{{Economy of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Slovenia}}\n[[Category:Economy of Slovenia| ]]\n[[Category:European Union member economies|Slovenia]]\n[[Category:OECD member economies|Slovenia]]\n[[Category:Economies of Europe by country|Slovenia]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTrade:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2001-03 \u2192 2001\u201303", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Slovenia"}
