In contrast to the mainly verbal comedy of his brothers [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Chico Marx]], Harpo's comic style was visual, being an example of both [[clown]] and [[pantomime]] traditions. He wore a curly reddish blonde wig, and never spoke during performances (he blew a horn or [[Whistling|whistled]] to communicate). He frequently used [[Theatrical property|props]] such as a horn cane, made up of a pipe, tape, and a bulbhorn, and he played the [[harp]] in most of his films.<ref name=\"birth\">{{cite web| title=Harpo Marx| website=Biography| url=https://www.biography.com/people/harpo-marx-16242175|date=April 2, 2014| accessdate=4 August 2018}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHarpo was born on November 23, 1888, in [[Manhattan]]. He grew up in a neighborhood now known as [[Carnegie Hill]] on the [[Upper East Side]] of Manhattan, on East 93rd Street off [[Lexington Avenue]]. The turn-of-the-century tenement that Harpo later called (in his autobiography ''Harpo Speaks!'') \"the first real home I can remember\" was populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans\u2014which even included a glass blower. Just across the street were the oldest [[brownstone]]s in the area, owned by people like [[David L. Loew]] and William Orth.\n\nHarpo's parents were [[Sam Marx]] (called \"Frenchie\" throughout his life) and his wife, [[Minnie Marx|Minnie Schoenberg Marx]]. Minnie's brother was [[Al Shean]]. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from [[East Frisia]] in Germany, and his father was a native of Alsace in [[France]] and worked as a tailor.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm| title=La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers| website=Judaisme.sdv.fr| language=French| trans-title=The Paternal Family of the Marx Brothers| quote=Extract from the Review of the Circle of Jewish Geneology| accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Multiple stories\u2014most unsubstantiated\u2014exist to explain Harpo's evolution as the \"silent\" character in the brothers' act. In his memoir, Groucho wrote that Harpo simply wasn't very good at memorizing dialogue, and thus was ideal for the role of the \"dunce who couldn't speak\", a common character in vaudeville acts of the time.<ref>Marx, Groucho (1959).

No one in town knew how to play the harp, so Harpo tuned it as best he could, starting with one basic note and tuning it from there. Three years later he found out he had tuned it incorrectly, but he could not have tuned it properly; if he had, the strings would have broken each night. Harpo's method placed much less tension on the strings.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Although he played this way for the rest of his life, he did try to learn how to play correctly, and he spent considerable money hiring the best teachers. They spent their time listening to him, fascinated by the way he played.<ref name=\"speaks\"/> The major exception was [[Mildred Dilling]], a professional harpist who did teach Harpo the proper techniques of the instrument and collaborated with him regularly when he had difficulty with various compositions.<ref>{{cite news| title=Mildred Dilling, 88, a Harpist, Performed for 5 Presidents| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/03/obituaries/mildred-dilling-88-a-harpist-performed-for-5-presidents.html| accessdate=23 January 2018| newspaper=The New York Times| date=3 January 1983}}</ref>\n\nIn the autobiography ''Harpo Speaks!'' (1961), he recounts how [[Chico Marx|Chico]] found him jobs playing [[piano]] to accompany [[silent film|silent movies]]. Unlike Chico, Harpo could play only two songs on the piano, \"Waltz Me Around Again, Willie\" and \"Love Me and the World Is Mine,\" but he adapted this small repertoire in different tempos to suit the action on the screen. He was also seen playing a portion of Rachmaninoff's \"Prelude in C# minor\" in ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' and chords on the piano in ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'', in such a way that the piano sounded much like a harp, as a prelude to actually playing the harp in that scene.\n\nHarpo had changed his name from Adolph to Arthur by 1911. This was due primarily to his dislike for the name Adolph (as a child, he was routinely called \"Ahdie\" instead). The name change may have also happened because of the similarity between Harpo's name and Adolph Marks, a prominent show business attorney in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book| last=Bader| first=Robert S.| title=Four of the Three Musketeers| publisher=Northwestern University Press| year=2016| location=Evanston, IL| page=147 |isbn=978-0-8101-3416-4}}</ref> [[Urban legends]] stating that the name change came about during [[World War I]] due to anti-German sentiment in the US, or during [[World War II]] because of the stigma that [[Adolf Hitler]] imposed on the name, are groundless.<ref>{{cite web| last=Mikkelson| first=Barbara and David| title=Lane Kibe| website=[[Snopes]]| date=2007-08-09| url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/harpo.htm| accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref>\n\n===On film===\n[[File:Harpo Marx playing the harp.jpeg|thumb|left|Harpo Marx playing the harp]]\nHis first screen appearance was in the film ''[[Humor Risk]]'' (1921), with his brothers, although according to Groucho, it was only screened once and then [[Lost film|lost]]. Four years later, Harpo appeared without his brothers in ''[[Too Many Kisses]]'' (1925), four years before the brothers' first released film, ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' (1929). In ''Too Many Kisses'', Harpo spoke the only line he would ever speak on-camera in a movie: \"You sure you can't move?\"<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/watching/film/Too_Many_Kisses.htm| title=Too Many Kisses (1925)| website=Marx-brothers.org| access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref> (said to the film's tied-up hero before punching him). Fittingly, it was a silent movie, and the audience saw only his lips move and the line on a title card.\n\nHarpo was often cast as Chico's eccentric partner-in-crime, whom he would often help by playing charades to tell of Groucho's problem, and/or annoy by giving Chico his leg, either to give it a rest or as an alternative to a handshake.\n\n[[File:Marx Brothers 1931.jpg|thumb|From top: Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo, ca. 1931]]\nHarpo became known for prop-laden [[Visual gag|sight gags]], in particular the seemingly [[Hammerspace|infinite number of odd things]] stored in his [[Overcoat|topcoat]]'s oversized pockets. In the film ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932), Groucho, referring to an impossible situation, tells Harpo that he cannot \"burn the candle at both ends.\" Harpo immediately produces from within his coat pocket a lit candle burning at both ends. In the same film, a homeless man on the street asks Harpo for money for a cup of coffee, and he subsequently produces a steaming cup, complete with saucer, from inside his coat. Also in ''Horse Feathers'', he has a fish and a sword, and when he wants to go to his speakeasy, he stabs the fish in its mouth with his sword to give the password, \"Swordfish.\" In ''Duck Soup'', he produces a lit blowtorch to light a cigar. As author Joe Adamson put in his book, ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo'', \"The president of the college has been shouted down by a mute.\"\n\nHarpo often used facial expressions and mime to get his point across. One of his facial expressions, which he used in every Marx Brothers film and stage play, beginning with ''Fun in Hi Skule'', was known as \"the Gookie.\" Harpo created it by mimicking the expression of Mr. Gehrke, a New York tobacconist who would make a similar face while concentrating on rolling cigars.<ref name=\"speaks\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book| last=Mitchell| first=Glenn| title=The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e28dAQAAIAAJ&dq=the+marx+brothers+encyclopedia&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=gehrke| publisher=Reynolds & Hearn| year=2003| location=London| page=123| isbn=978-1903111499| url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nHarpo further distinguished his character by wearing a \"fright wig\". Early in his career it was dyed pink, as evidenced by color film posters of the time and by allusions to it in films, with character names such as \"Pinky\" in ''Duck Soup''. It tended to show as blonde on-screen due to the black-and-white film stock at the time. Over time, he darkened the pink to more of a reddish color, again films alluded to it with character names such as \"Rusty\".\n\nHis non-speaking in his early films was occasionally referred to by the other Marx Brothers, who were careful to imply that his character's not speaking was a choice rather than a disability. They would make joking reference to this part of his act. For example, in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' his character was ironically dubbed \"The Professor\". In ''The Cocoanuts'', this exchange occurred:\n\n'''Groucho''': \"Who is this?\"\n\n'''Chico''': \"Dat's-a my partner, but he no speak.\"\n\n'''Groucho''': \"Oh, that's your [[wikt:silent partner|silent partner]]!\"\n\nIn later films, Harpo was repeatedly put in situations where he attempted to convey a vital message by whistling and pantomime, reinforcing the idea that his character was unable to speak.\n\nThe Marxes' film ''At the Circus (1939)'' contains a unique scene where Harpo is ostensibly heard saying \"A-choo!\" twice, as he sneezes. It is unclear, however, whether he actually voiced the line, or if he mimed it while someone said it off-camera.  \n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Harpo and Chico Marx General Electric Theater 1959.JPG|thumb|right|Harpo and Chico Marx in \"The Incredible Jewelry Robbery\" (1959)]]\n[[File:Harpo Marx Silent Panic DuPont Show 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Marx as the \"mechanical man\" in \"A Silent Panic\" (1960)]]\nIn 1933, following U.S. diplomatic recognition of the [[Soviet Union]], he spent six weeks in [[Moscow]] as a performer and goodwill ambassador.<ref name=\"speaks\" /> His tour was a huge success.

Walt Disney would later have Harpo (with Groucho and Chico) appear as one of King Cole's \"Fiddlers Three\" in the Silly Symphony ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]''.\n\nHarpo was also caricatured in ''[[Popeye the Sailor filmography (Fleischer Studios)#1934|Sock-A-Bye Baby]]'' (1934), an early episode of the ''[[Popeye]]'' cartoon series created by [[Fleischer Studios]]. Harpo is playing the harp, and wakes up Popeye's baby, and then Popeye kills him. (After Popeye hits him, a halo appears over his head and he floats to the sky.)\n\n[[Friz Freleng]]'s 1936 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon ''[[The Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]'' featuring animal versions of assorted celebrities, caricatures Harpo as a bird with a red [[beak]]. When he first appears, he is chasing a woman, but the woman later turns out to be Groucho.\n\nHarpo also took an interest in painting, and a few of his works can be seen in his autobiography. In the book, Marx tells a story about how he tried to paint a nude female model, but froze up because he simply did not know how to paint properly. The model took pity on him, however, showing him a few basic strokes with a brush, until finally Harpo (fully clothed) took the model's place as the subject and the naked woman painted ''his'' portrait.<ref>Marx 1961, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\nHarpo recorded an album of harp music for [[RCA Victor]] (''Harp by Harpo'', 1952) and two for [[Mercury Records]] (''Harpo in Hi-Fi'', 1957; ''Harpo at Work'', 1958).\n\nHarpo made television appearances through the 1950s and 60s, including a 1955 episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]],'' in which he and [[Lucille Ball]] re-enacted the famous mirror scene from the Marx Brothers movie ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933).<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0609287|title=I Love Lucy: Lucy and Harpo Marx}}</ref> In this scene, they are both supposed to be Harpo, not Groucho; he stays the same and she is dressed as him. About this time, he also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]''. Harpo and Chico played a television anthology episode of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' entitled \"The Incredible Jewelry Robbery\" entirely in pantomime in 1959, with a brief surprise appearance by Groucho at the end. In 1960, he appeared in an episode of ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'' entitled \"A Silent Panic\", playing a deaf-mute who, as a \"mechanical man\" in a [[department store]] window, witnessed a gangland murder. In 1961, he made guest appearances on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[Play Your Hunch]]'', ''[[Candid Camera]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[Here's Hollywood]]'', ''[[Art Linkletter's House Party]]'', Groucho's quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and ''Your Surprise Package'' to publicize his [[autobiography]] ''Harpo Speaks!''.\n\nIn November 1961 he guest-starred with [[Carol Burnett]] in an installment of ''[[The DuPont Show of the Week]]'' entitled \"The Wonderful World of Toys\". The show was filmed in [[Central Park]] and featured Marx playing \"[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]\" on the harp. Other stars appearing in the episode included [[Eva Gabor]], [[Audrey Meadows]], [[Mitch Miller]] and [[Milton Berle]]. A visit to the set inspired poet [[Robert Lowell]] to compose a poem about Marx.\n\nHarpo's two final television appearances came less than a month apart in late 1962. He portrayed a guardian angel on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' on September 25. He guest starred as himself on October 20 in the episode \"Musicale\" of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (TV series)|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', a [[sitcom]] starring [[Fess Parker]], based on the 1939 [[Frank Capra]] film.<ref>{{cite news| last=Hickey| first=Matthew| title=TV's Silent Panic: Harpo Marx & the Golden Age of Television| magazine=Filmfax| pages=64\u201369| date=May\u2013June 1996| url= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Harpo & kids.jpg|thumb|Harpo Marx and three of his children wearing Harpo wigs in Los Angeles, 1954]]\nHarpo married actress [[Susan Fleming]] on September 28, 1936.

He was also well known for playing the harp, though he could not read music. Outside the professional harp community, he remains one of the best \"ambassadors for the harp\" the world has known and one of his harps was donated to an Israeli orchestra.

In contrast to the mainly verbal comedy of his brothers [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Chico Marx]], Harpo's comic style was visual, being an example of both [[clown]] and [[pantomime]] traditions. He wore a curly reddish blonde wig, and never spoke during performances (he blew a horn or [[Whistling|whistled]] to communicate).

He grew up in a neighborhood now known as [[Carnegie Hill]] on the [[Upper East Side]] of Manhattan, on East 93rd Street off [[Lexington Avenue]]. The turn-of-the-century tenement that Harpo later called (in his autobiography ''Harpo Speaks!'') \"the first real home I can remember\" was populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans\u2014which even included a glass blower. Just across the street were the oldest [[brownstone]]s in the area, owned by people like [[David L. Loew]] and William Orth.\n\nHarpo's parents were [[Sam Marx]] (called \"Frenchie\" throughout his life) and his wife, [[Minnie Marx|Minnie Schoenberg Marx]]. Minnie's brother was [[Al Shean]]. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from [[East Frisia]] in Germany, and his father was a native of Alsace in [[France]] and worked as a tailor.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm| title=La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers| website=Judaisme.sdv.fr| language=French| trans-title=The Paternal Family of the Marx Brothers| website=Circle of Jewish Geneology| accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Multiple stories\u2014most unsubstantiated\u2014exist to explain Harpo's evolution as the \"silent\" character in the brothers' act. In his memoir, Groucho wrote that Harpo simply wasn't very good at memorizing dialogue, and thus was ideal for the role of the \"dunce who couldn't speak\", a common character in vaudeville acts of the time.<ref>Marx, Groucho (1959).

No one in town knew how to play the harp, so Harpo tuned it as best he could, starting with one basic note and tuning it from there. Three years later he found out he had tuned it incorrectly, but he could not have tuned it properly; if he had, the strings would have broken each night. Harpo's method placed much less tension on the strings.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Although he played this way for the rest of his life, he did try to learn how to play correctly, and he spent considerable money hiring the best teachers.

(1961), he recounts how [[Chico Marx|Chico]] found him jobs playing [[piano]] to accompany [[silent film|silent movies]]. Unlike Chico, Harpo could play only two songs on the piano, \"Waltz Me Around Again, Willie\" and \"Love Me and the World Is Mine,\" but he adapted this small repertoire in different tempos to suit the action on the screen. He was also seen playing a portion of Rachmaninoff's \"Prelude in C# minor\" in ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' and chords on the piano in ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'', in such a way that the piano sounded much like a harp, as a prelude to actually playing the harp in that scene.\n\nHarpo had changed his name from Adolph to Arthur by 1911. This was due primarily to his dislike for the name Adolph (as a child, he was routinely called \"Ahdie\" instead). The name change may have also happened because of the similarity between Harpo's name and Adolph Marks, a prominent show business attorney in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book| last=Bader| first=Robert S.| title=Four of the Three Musketeers| publisher=Northwestern University Press| year=2016| location=Evanston, IL| page=147 |isbn=978-0-8101-3416-4}}</ref> [[Urban legends]] stating that the name change came about during [[World War I]] due to anti-German sentiment in the US, or during [[World War II]] because of the stigma that [[Adolf Hitler]] imposed on the name, are groundless.<ref>{{cite web| last=Mikkelson| first=Barbara and David| title=Lane Kibe| website=[[Snopes]]| date=2007-08-09| url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/harpo.htm| accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref>\n\n===On film===\n[[File:Harpo Marx playing the harp.jpeg|thumb|left|Harpo Marx playing the harp]]\nHis first screen appearance was in the film ''[[Humor Risk]]'' (1921), with his brothers, although according to Groucho, it was only screened once and then [[Lost film|lost]]. Four years later, Harpo appeared without his brothers in ''[[Too Many Kisses]]'' (1925), four years before the brothers' first released film, ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' (1929). In ''Too Many Kisses'', Harpo spoke the only line he would ever speak on-camera in a movie: \"You sure you can't move?\"<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/watching/film/Too_Many_Kisses.htm| title=Too Many Kisses (1925)| website=Marx-brothers.org| access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref> (said to the film's tied-up hero before punching him). Fittingly, it was a silent movie, and the audience saw only his lips move and the line on a title card.\n\nHarpo was often cast as Chico's eccentric partner-in-crime, whom he would often help by playing charades to tell of Groucho's problem, and/or annoy by giving Chico his leg, either to give it a rest or as an alternative to a handshake.\n\n[[File:Marx Brothers 1931.jpg|thumb|From top: Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo, ca. 1931]]\nHarpo became known for prop-laden [[Visual gag|sight gags]], in particular the seemingly [[Hammerspace|infinite number of odd things]] stored in his [[Overcoat|topcoat]]'s oversized pockets. In the film ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932), Groucho, referring to an impossible situation, tells Harpo that he cannot \"burn the candle at both ends.\" Harpo immediately produces from within his coat pocket a lit candle burning at both ends. In the same film, a homeless man on the street asks Harpo for money for a cup of coffee, and he subsequently produces a steaming cup, complete with saucer, from inside his coat. Also in ''Horse Feathers'', he has a fish and a sword, and when he wants to go to his speakeasy, he stabs the fish in its mouth with his sword to give the password, \"Swordfish.\" In ''Duck Soup'', he produces a lit blowtorch to light a cigar. As author Joe Adamson put in his book, ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo'', \"The president of the college has been shouted down by a mute.\"\n\nHarpo often used facial expressions and mime to get his point across. One of his facial expressions, which he used in every Marx Brothers film and stage play, beginning with ''Fun in Hi Skule'', was known as \"the Gookie.\" Harpo created it by mimicking the expression of Mr. Gehrke, a New York tobacconist who would make a similar face while concentrating on rolling cigars.<ref name=\"speaks\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book| last=Mitchell| first=Glenn| title=The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e28dAQAAIAAJ&dq=the+marx+brothers+encyclopedia&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=gehrke| publisher=Reynolds & Hearn| year=2003| location=London| page=123| isbn=978-1903111499| url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nHarpo further distinguished his character by wearing a \"fright wig\". Early in his career it was dyed pink, as evidenced by color film posters of the time and by allusions to it in films, with character names such as \"Pinky\" in ''Duck Soup''. It tended to show as blonde on-screen due to the black-and-white film stock at the time. Over time, he darkened the pink to more of a reddish color, again films alluded to it with character names such as \"Rusty\".\n\nHis non-speaking in his early films was occasionally referred to by the other Marx Brothers, who were careful to imply that his character's not speaking was a choice rather than a disability. They would make joking reference to this part of his act. For example, in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' his character was ironically dubbed \"The Professor\". In ''The Cocoanuts'', this exchange occurred:\n\n'''Groucho''': \"Who is this?\"\n\n'''Chico''': \"Dat's-a my partner, but he no speak.\"\n\n'''Groucho''': \"Oh, that's your [[wikt:silent partner|silent partner]]!\"\n\nIn later films, Harpo was repeatedly put in situations where he attempted to convey a vital message by whistling and pantomime, reinforcing the idea that his character was unable to speak.\n\nThe Marxes' film ''At the Circus (1939)'' contains a unique scene where Harpo is ostensibly heard saying \"A-choo!\" twice, as he sneezes. It is unclear, however, whether he actually voiced the line, or if he mimed it while someone said it off-camera.  \n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Harpo and Chico Marx General Electric Theater 1959.JPG|thumb|right|Harpo and Chico Marx in \"The Incredible Jewelry Robbery\" (1959)]]\n[[File:Harpo Marx Silent Panic DuPont Show 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Marx as the \"mechanical man\" in \"A Silent Panic\" (1960)]]\nIn 1933, following U.S. diplomatic recognition of the [[Soviet Union]], he spent six weeks in [[Moscow]] as a performer and goodwill ambassador.<ref name=\"speaks\" /> His tour was a huge success.

Harpo, having no knowledge of Russian, pronounced it as \"Exapno Mapcase\". At that time Harpo and the Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] became friends and even performed a routine on stage together.<ref>''Current Biography 1941, pp 518\u201320.</ref> During this time he served as a secret courier; delivering communiques to and from the US embassy in Moscow at the request of Ambassador [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.]], smuggling the messages in and out of Russia by taping a sealed envelope to his leg beneath his trousers, an event described in [[David Fromkin]]'s 1995 book ''In the Time of the Americans''.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O1UNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=im4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3199,8313638&dq=harpo-marx+soviet-union+courier \"At Our Best\"], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', July 30, 1995.

Harpo was part of a team of [[polo]]-playing [[movie stars]] which included [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]]. His mount was an [[ostrich]]. Walt Disney would later have Harpo (with Groucho and Chico) appear as one of King Cole's \"Fiddlers Three\" in the Silly Symphony ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]''.\n\nHarpo was also caricatured in ''[[Popeye the Sailor filmography (Fleischer Studios)#1934|Sock-A-Bye Baby]]'' (1934), an early episode of the ''[[Popeye]]'' cartoon series created by [[Fleischer Studios]]. Harpo is playing the harp, and wakes up Popeye's baby, and then Popeye kills him. (After Popeye hits him, a halo appears over his head and he floats to the sky.)\n\n[[Friz Freleng]]'s 1936 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon ''[[The Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]'' featuring animal versions of assorted celebrities, caricatures Harpo as a bird with a red [[beak]]. When he first appears, he is chasing a woman, but the woman later turns out to be Groucho.\n\nHarpo also took an interest in painting, and a few of his works can be seen in his autobiography. In the book, Marx tells a story about how he tried to paint a nude female model, but froze up because he simply did not know how to paint properly. The model took pity on him, however, showing him a few basic strokes with a brush, until finally Harpo (fully clothed) took the model's place as the subject and the naked woman painted ''his'' portrait.<ref>Marx 1961, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\nHarpo recorded an album of harp music for [[RCA Victor]] (''Harp by Harpo'', 1952) and two for [[Mercury Records]] (''Harpo in Hi-Fi'', 1957; ''Harpo at Work'', 1958).\n\nHarpo made television appearances through the 1950s and 60s, including a 1955 episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]],'' in which he and [[Lucille Ball]] re-enacted the famous mirror scene from the Marx Brothers movie ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933).<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0609287|title=I Love Lucy: Lucy and Harpo Marx}}</ref> In this scene, they are both supposed to be Harpo, not Groucho; he stays the same and she is dressed as him. About this time, he also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]''. Harpo and Chico played a television anthology episode of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' entitled \"The Incredible Jewelry Robbery\" entirely in pantomime in 1959, with a brief surprise appearance by Groucho at the end. In 1960, he appeared in an episode of ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'' entitled \"A Silent Panic\", playing a deaf-mute who, as a \"mechanical man\" in a [[department store]] window, witnessed a gangland murder. In 1961, he made guest appearances on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[Play Your Hunch]]'', ''[[Candid Camera]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[Here's Hollywood]]'', ''[[Art Linkletter's House Party]]'', Groucho's quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', and ''Your Surprise Package'' to publicize his [[autobiography]] ''Harpo Speaks!''.\n\nIn November 1961 he guest-starred with [[Carol Burnett]] in an installment of ''[[The DuPont Show of the Week]]'' entitled \"The Wonderful World of Toys\". The show was filmed in [[Central Park]] and featured Marx playing \"[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]\" on the harp. Other stars appearing in the episode included [[Eva Gabor]], [[Audrey Meadows]], [[Mitch Miller]] and [[Milton Berle]]. A visit to the set inspired poet [[Robert Lowell]] to compose a poem about Marx.\n\nHarpo's two final television appearances came less than a month apart in late 1962. He portrayed a guardian angel on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' on September 25. He guest starred as himself on October 20 in the episode \"Musicale\" of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (TV series)|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', a [[sitcom]] starring [[Fess Parker]], based on the 1939 [[Frank Capra]] film.<ref>{{cite news| last=Hickey| first=Matthew| title=TV's Silent Panic: Harpo Marx & the Golden Age of Television| magazine=Filmfax| pages=64\u201369| date=May\u2013June 1996| url= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Harpo & kids.jpg|thumb|Harpo Marx and three of his children wearing Harpo wigs in Los Angeles, 1954]]\nHarpo married actress [[Susan Fleming]] on September 28, 1936.

Outside the professional harp community, he remains one of the best \"ambassadors for the harp\" the world has known and one of his harps was donated to an Israeli orchestra.
