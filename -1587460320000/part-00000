The count threatens the lovers, and the girl urges the valet to kill the count.  The play parallels the prior situation of Boconnion, Braxton and Rosalind.  At the point just before the girl and the valet are about to kill the count, Boconnion halts the play.  The actress Jenny (the wife in the play) faints, and Tooley takes her upstairs, where he discovers the murdered landowner.  Boconnion imprisons the actors in the cellar and plans to set fire to the manor to get rid of them the next morning.  Boconnion then kisses Jenny to taunt Rosalind, but then it is revealed that Jenny has the [[Black Death|plague]].  A ballad from Jenny reaffirms a link between her troupe and the earlier actors.

Within this theoretical model, upon setting the initial and final frequencies of light to the same value, the mathematics describe the Hyper Rayleigh Scattering Optical Activity. The theory was well in advance of its time, and the effect remained elusive for 40 years. Its author David L. Andrews referred to it as the \"Impossible Theory\". However, in January 2019, an experimental demonstration was reported by Ventsislav K. Valev and his team.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/-impossible-uea-physics-theory-proven-in-practice-after-40-years |title=\u201cImpossible\u201d UEA physics theory proven in practice after 40 years - News - UEA |website=www.uea.ac.uk |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\"Valev1\">\n{{cite journal |\n last1 = Collins|\n first1 = J.T. |\n last2 = Rusimova |\n first2 = K.R. |\n last3 =  Hooper|\n first3 = D.C.. |\n last4 =  Jeong|\n first4 = H.-H. |\n last5 =  Ohnoutek |\n first5 = L. |\n last6 =  Pradaux-Caggiano|\n first6 = F. |\n last7 =  Verbiest|\n first7 = T. |\n last8 =  Carbery|\n first8 = D.R. |\n last9 =  Fischer |\n first9 = P. |\n last10 = Valev |\n first10 = V.K. |\n year = 2019 |\n title =  First Observation of Optical Activity in Hyper-Rayleigh Scattering |\n journal = Physical Review X  |\n volume = 9|\n pages = 011024|\n doi = 10.1103/PhysRevX.9.011024}}\n</ref> The team investigated the hyper Rayleigh scattering (at the [[second harmonic generation]] frequency) from chiral nanohelices made of silver. Valev and his team observed that the intensity of the hyper Rayleigh scattering light depended on the direction of circularly polarized light and that this dependence reversed with the chirality of the nanohelices. Valev's work unambiguously established that the effect is physically possible, opening the way for nonlinear chiroptical investigations of a variety of chiral light-scattering materials.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Significance==\nHyper Rayleigh Scattering Optical Activity (HRS OA) is the most fundamental nonlinear chiral optical (chiroptical) effect;{{whom|date=April 2020}} other nonlinear chiroptical effects have additional requirements, which make them conceptually more involved, i.e. less fundamental. HRS OA is a scattering effect and therefore it does not require the frequency conversion process to be coherent; contrary to other nonlinear chiroptical effects, such as Second Harmonic Generation Circular Dichroism<ref>\n{{cite journal |         \n last1 = Petralli-Mallow|\n first1 = T.T. |\n last2 = Wong|\n first2 = T.M. |\n last3 =  Byers|\n first3 = J.D. |\n last4 = Yee|\n first4 = H.I. |\n last5 =  Hicks|\n first5 = J.M. |\n year = 1993|\n title =  Circular dichroism spectroscopy at interfaces: a surface second harmonic generation study |\n journal = J.

Moreover, HRS OA is a [[parametric process (optics)]]: the initial and final quantum mechanical states of the excited electron are the same. Because the excitation proceeds via [[virtual state]]s, there is no restriction on the frequency of incident light.

He is more commonly known by his ringname '''Mike Mendoza'''. Early in his career he worked as Enigma (stylized as Eni?ma), continuing to perform under the name for some time afterwards. Ortiz began his career in the [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]] (IWA) as a cruiserweight, winning the division's title before ascending to the lower mid-tier and later performing in the tag team division and winning the EWO World Tag Team Championship in an interpromotional angle with the large independent promotion Extreme Wrestling Organization (EWO). \n\nIn 2013, he debuted in the [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC), where he reigned in the junior heavyweight and tag team divisions before concluding his stay following a run with the second-tier [[WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship]]. In 2017, Ortiz joined [[Liga Wrestling]] (then known as the World Wrestling League), where he is a two-time [[WWL World Heavyweight Championship|WWL World Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n==Wrestling career==\n===International Wrestling Association (2010\u20132012)===\nTo begin his career, Ortiz adopted the gimmick of \"Enigma\", initially wrestling under a mask. On March 20, 2010, he debuted in the [[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]] (IWA), winning his contest in the first round of a tournament to determine the first contender of the cruiserweight-based Xtreme Combat Division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwapr.tv/index.php?page=articulo&id=1269208407 |title=Resultados:Copa Alcalde Las Piedras 03/20/10 |publisher=[[International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)|International Wrestling Association]] |date=2010-03-21 |accessdate=2012-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325152213/http://www.iwapr.tv/index.php?page=articulo&id=1269208407 |archivedate=2010-03-25 }}</ref> On June 26, 2010, he competed in a royal rumble for the 5th Jos\u00e9 Miguel P\u00e9rez Cup being the tenth eliminated competitor.

This decision was explained in story line, when a now more muscular Ortiz explained that he had surpassed the constraints of a cruiserweight division, choosing instead to create a new championship and become the self-proclaimed \"IWA Television Champion\".

On February 25, 2012, he and Cupules entered an interpromotional angle that had been running between the IWA and the Extreme Wrestling Organization (EWO) since December 2011. In their debut in EWO, they captured the EWO World Tag Team Championship and promptly rebranded them as the \u201cYou T\u00fa Tag Team Championship\u201d. They held the titles until May, when Doom Patrol won it in a three-way match that included Los Sorprendentes Lights. Afterwards, Los Controversiales remained involved in the title picture.\n\n===Independent circuit (2012\u20132013)===\nAfter the IWA entered a hiatus, Ortiz continued performing in the local independent circuit as part of Los Controversiales along Cupeles. In July they appeared at the Puerto Rico/Panama based International Gladiators Wrestling Alliance (IGWA), self-proclaiming themselves tag team champions. During the second half of 2012, EWO became involved in a charity campaign known as Ponte Pa\u2019 lo +, which was turned into an angle after several of the wrestlers involved were attacked by masked \u201cnegative\u201d counterparts. Team Positivo and Team Negativo clashed throughout the following months. On December 15, 2012, the heels lost their masks in a bet between both teams, revealing their identity as Ortiz, Cupeles, Real Michael, Two Face, Joseph Cruz \u201cJ.C.\u201d Navarro and Oscar Anderson. Joined by the latter, the three became known as Los Realengos and issued a challenge in January 2013, which was accepted by Spider and Jason Sparks.

He advocated religious toleration and emerged as a leader of the [[Levellers]] in 1647, which led to his imprisonment in 1649. \n\nIn October 1645 Walwyn published ''England's Lamentable Slaverie'', his famous rebuke to John Lilburne, in which he criticised his fellow Leveller for a misguided reliance on the [[Magna Carta]] of 1225 as the foundation for citizens' rights. He argued that Magna Carta was, \"more precious in your [Lilburne's] esteem than it deserveth\", dismissing it as a small set of concessions \"wrestled out of the pawes\" of Norman conquerors and describing it as, \"a messe of pottage\", and (in the following year), \"but a beggerly thing containing many marks of intollerable bondage\". Walwyn's critique of the appeal to Magna Carta was compelling and fundamentally accurate, and instead he proposed a fresh charter, a proto-social contract based in equity and right reason, rather than on compromised accretions of the law.<ref>Foxley, Rachel. \u201c\u2018More Precious in Your Esteem than It Deserveth\u2019?: Magna Carta and Seventeenth-Century Politics.\u201d ''Magna Carta: History, Context and Influence'', edited by Lawrence Goldman, University of London Press, London, 2018, pp. 61\u201378, pp.72-73. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv5136sc.12. Accessed 20 Apr. 2020.</ref>  \n\nDuring 1646 he wrote five pamphlets in response to [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Thomas Edwards']] [[Gangraena]], in which Walwyn was described as \"a [[Seekers|Seeker]], a dangerous man, a strong head\". In 1649, whilst held in the [[Tower of London]] on a charge of [[Treason]], he published \"The Fountain of Slaunder Discovered\" and \"Walwyns Just Defence\" to defend his character against the publication of \"Walwyn's Wiles\".<ref name=\"Lee\">[[Sidney Lee|Lee, Sidney]] (1903), [[Dictionary of National Biography]] [https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft Index and Epitome], [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft#page/1364/mode/1up p. 1364] (also main entry lix 284)</ref><ref>Walwym is sometimes confused with William Walwyn who was appointed canon of St. Paul's, London, in 1660, but is not the same man.

He advocated religious toleration and emerged as a leader of the [[Levellers]] in 1647, which led to his imprisonment in 1649. \n\nIn October 1645 Walwyn published ''England's Lamentable Slaverie'', his famous rebuke to John Lilburne, in which he criticised his fellow Leveller for a misguided reliance on the [[Magna Carta]] of 1225 as the foundation for citizens' rights. He argued that Magna Carta was, \"more precious in your [Liliburne's] esteem than it deserveth\", dismissing it as a small set of concessions \"wrestled out of the pawes\" of Norman conquerors and describing it as, \"a messe of pottage\", and (in the following year), \"but a beggerly thing containing many marks of intollerable bondage\". Walwyn's critique of the appeal to Magna Carta was compelling and fundamentally accurate, and instead he proposed a fresh charter, a proto-social contract based in equity and right reason, rather than on compromised accretions of the law.<ref>Foxley, Rachel. \u201c\u2018More Precious in Your Esteem than It Deserveth\u2019?: Magna Carta and Seventeenth-Century Politics.\u201d ''Magna Carta: History, Context and Influence'', edited by Lawrence Goldman, University of London Press, London, 2018, pp. 61\u201378, pp.72-73.

In 1649, whilst held in the [[Tower of London]] on a charge of [[Treason]], he published \"The Fountain of Slaunder Discovered\" and \"Walwyns Just Defence\" to defend his character against the publication of \"Walwyn's Wiles\".<ref name=\"Lee\">[[Sidney Lee|Lee, Sidney]] (1903), [[Dictionary of National Biography]] [https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft Index and Epitome], [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft#page/1364/mode/1up p. 1364] (also main entry lix 284)</ref><ref>Walwym is sometimes confused with William Walwyn who was appointed canon of St. Paul's, London, in 1660, but is not the same man.
