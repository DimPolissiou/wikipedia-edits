In prison confessions and his autobiography, he claimed to have committed 22&nbsp;murders, most of which could not be corroborated, and over 1000&nbsp;acts of [[sodomy]] of boys and men. After a series of imprisonments and escapes, he was executed in 1930 for the murder of a prison employee at [[Leavenworth Federal Prison]].\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota]], the son of [[East Prussia]]n immigrants Johann and Matilda Gottlieb Panzram, Panzram was raised on his family's farm with five siblings. Carl Panzram felt odd from a young age: by the age of five or six he was a liar and thief and claimed to become meaner the older he grew.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/nas/streaming/dept/scuastaf/collections/Panzram/Panzram-Box01Folder03.pdf|title=Panzram Papers w/ DOB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418002949/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/nas/streaming/dept/scuastaf/collections/Panzram/Panzram-Box01Folder03.pdf|archive-date=2015-04-18|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/nas/streaming/dept/scuastaf/collections/Panzram/Panzram-Box01Folder03.pdf |title=\"Panzram Papers w/DOB\" (PDF) |access-date=2018-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325232634/https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/nas/streaming/dept/scuastaf/collections/Panzram/Panzram-Box01Folder03.pdf |archive-date=2018-03-25 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1899, Panzram was in juvenile court on a charge of being drunk and disorderly.

He ran away from home at the age of 14, a couple of weeks after his parole and merely two weeks after attempting to kill a Lutheran cleric with a revolver, to become a [[hobo]]. He often [[freighthopping|traveled via train cars]]. He later claimed that he was once [[gang raped]] by a group of hobos aboard a train.\n\n== Crimes ==\n\n=== Early crimes ===\nPanzram claimed that after escaping from a Montana State Reform School\u2014along with an inmate named Jimmie Benson\u2014both were involved in a string of burglaries, robberies, and arsons throughout the Midwest until they split up. In 1907, at the age of 15, after getting drunk in a saloon in [[Montana]], Panzram enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. Shortly thereafter, he was convicted of [[larceny]] and served a prison sentence from April&nbsp;20, 1908 to 1910 at [[Fort Leavenworth]]'s [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]]. Secretary of War [[William Howard Taft]] approved the sentence. Panzram later claimed that any goodness left in him was smashed out during his Leavenworth imprisonment.<ref name=journal/>\n\nAfter his release and [[dishonorable discharge]], Panzram resumed his career as a thief, stealing anything from bicycles to [[yacht]]s, and was caught and imprisoned multiple times. He served time under his own name and various aliases in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]; [[Rusk, Texas]]; [[The Dalles, Oregon]]; [[Harrison, Idaho]]; [[Butte, Montana]]; Montana State Reform School; [[Montana State Prison]]; [[Oregon State Penitentiary]]; [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]; [[Sing Sing Correctional Facility]]; [[Clinton Correctional Facility]]; and [[Washington, D.C.]] While incarcerated, Panzram frequently attacked officers and refused to follow their orders. The officers retaliated, subjecting him to beatings and other punishments.<ref name=serial/>\n\nIn his [[autobiography]], Panzram wrote that he was \"rage personified\" and that he would often rape men whom he had robbed. He was noted for his large stature and great physical strength\u2014due to years of hard labor at Leavenworth and other prisons&nbsp;\u2013 which aided him in overpowering most men he encountered.<ref name=serial/> He also engaged in [[vandalism]] and [[arson]]. By his own admission, one of the few times he did not engage in criminal activities was when he was employed as a [[strikebreaker]] against union employees. On one occasion, he tried to sign aboard as a ship's steward on an Army transport vessel, but was discharged when he reported to work intoxicated.<ref name=journal/>\n\n=== Escalating violence ===\nPanzram claimed in his 1929 autobiography, that after serving a short sentence at [[Rusk, Texas]], he went to [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] in the winter of 1910, to try to enlist in the [[Federal Army|Federal Mexican Army]]. He then left on a train for [[Del Rio, Texas]], and got off in a small town {{convert|50|to|100|mi|km|0}} east of [[El Paso, Texas|El&nbsp;Paso]], where about a mile south of that town he claimed to have abducted, assaulted, kicked, and strangled a man and then stole $35 from the victim.<ref>\"El Paso Evening Post Jan 2, 1929\".p. 9. Officials could not confirm Panzram claim.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1911, Panzram, going by the alias \"Jefferson Davis\", was arrested in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], for stealing a bicycle.

He broke out of jail after two to three months. While he was on the run, he used the alias \"Jeff Davis\". He was arrested in Harrison, Idaho, but again he escaped from county jail. He was arrested in Chinook, Montana, under the alias \"Jefferson Davis\" and sentenced to one year in prison for burglary to be served at the [[Montana State Prison]]. \n\nOn April 27, 1913, Panzram, using his \"Jefferson Davis\" alias, was admitted to the state prison at [[Deer Lodge, Montana]]. He escaped on November&nbsp;13. Within a week, he was arrested, giving his name as \"Jeff Rhoades\" in [[Three Forks, Montana|Three Forks]], for burglary, and returned to Deer Lodge for an additional year. He was released on March&nbsp;3, 1915. On June&nbsp;1, Panzram burglarized a house in [[Astoria, Oregon]], and was arrested soon after while attempting to sell some of the stolen items.\n\nHe was sentenced to seven years' in prison, to be served at the [[Oregon State Penitentiary]] in [[Salem, Oregon]], where he arrived on June&nbsp;24. Warden [[Harry Minto]] believed in harsh treatment of inmates, including beatings and isolation, among other disciplinary measures. Later, Panzram stated that he swore he \"would never do that seven years and I defied the warden and all his officers to make me.\"<ref name=serial>{{cite web |url=http://serialkillercalendar.com/Detailed-Bio-of-Carl%20Panzram.html |title=Carl Panzram |work=Serial Killer Calendar |access-date=2007-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818001159/http://serialkillercalendar.com/Detailed-Bio-of-Carl%20Panzram.html |archive-date=2016-08-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nLater that year, Panzram helped fellow inmate Otto Hooker escape from the prison. While attempting to evade recapture, Hooker killed Minto, marking Panzram's first known involvement in a murder, as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] before the fact.<ref name=serial/> In his prison record he falsely gave his age as 30, and his place of birth as [[Alabama]]. The one true bit of autobiography he did give was his occupation: \"thief\".\n\nPanzram was disciplined several times while at Salem, including 61 days in [[solitary confinement]], before escaping on September&nbsp;18, 1917. After two shootouts, he was recaptured and returned to the prison. On May&nbsp;12, 1918, he escaped once again by sawing through the bars of his cell, and caught a freight train heading east. He began going by the name \"John O'Leary\" and shaved off his moustache. He would never return to the Northwest.<ref name=serial/>Allegedly he ended up in New York City and got a Seaman Identification card; sailed on the steamship ''James S. Whitney'' to Panama, where he tried to steal a small boat with the help of a drunken sailor who killed everyone on board and was arrested. Panzram travelled to Peru to work in a copper mine, and then traveled to Chile, [[Port Arthur, Texas]], London, Edinburgh, Paris, and Hamburg.\n\n=== Murder spree ===\nIn August 1920, Panzram burglarized the [[William H. Taft Mansion]] in New Haven, Connecticut, a home of [[William Howard Taft]], whom he held responsible for his Leavenworth imprisonment. He stole a large amount of jewelry and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]],{{refn|group=fn|Panzram claimed the jewelry and bonds were worth $40,000.

In June&nbsp;1923, in [[New Rochelle, New York]], he stole a yacht that belonged to the police chief of New Rochelle. He picked up Walosin and promised him a job on the boat, but instead, sodomized him.\n\nOn June 27, on the river near Kingston, New York, Panzram claimed to have used a .38&nbsp;caliber pistol from the stolen yacht to kill a man who tried to rob him while on the yacht.

Shortly thereafter, he was convicted of [[larceny]] and served a prison sentence from April&nbsp;20, 1908 to 1910 at [[Fort Leavenworth]]'s [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]].

The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Tower of God characters}}\n===Plot===\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Other media==\n===Game===\nIn 2013, Naver released a [[mobile game|mobile]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] on [[Google Play]] based on ''Tower of God'', developed by Sunrise. The game drew in 120 million players shortly after its initial release. The ''Tower of God'' role-playing game's development continued for two years after its initial release, and the game saw a full commercial release in 2016.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by hunters Kuhn and Rak. Kuhn finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Kuhn try to convince him, but he becomes naive to the situation and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who passes with believed luck, are pushed back by the water but most are eventually able to pass the formed barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place. A blonde figure watches the group and instantly recognizes Khun.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Correct Door\n| TranslitTitle       = Seikai no Tobira\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}-->\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nHead of [[Line Webtoon]] Tom Akel stated in July 2015 that the manhwa's weekly installments are read by five million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/business/media/free-digital-comics-site-is-expanding-in-us-with-celebrity-help.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stan Lee and Michelle Phan Help Line Webtoon, Digital Comics Site, Expand in U.S.|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> \n\nOn the original Korean platform, ''Tower of God'' is the most profitable series based on the paid preview system, where readers can buy up to 3 chapters in advance.

The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Tower of God characters}}\n===Plot===\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Other media==\n===Game===\nIn 2013, Naver released a [[mobile game|mobile]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] on [[Google Play]] based on ''Tower of God'', developed by Sunrise.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by hunters Kuhn and Rak.

With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Kuhn try to convince him, but he becomes naive to the situation and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who passes with believed luck, are pushed back by the water but most are eventually able to pass the formed barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place.
