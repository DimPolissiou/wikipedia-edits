{"title_page": "Segmentation fault", "text_new": "{{redirect|Segfault|the website|Segfault (website)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2011}}\nIn [[computing]], a '''segmentation fault''' (often shortened to '''segfault''') or '''access violation''' is a [[Fault (computing)|fault]], or failure condition, raised by hardware with [[memory protection]], notifying an [[operating system]] (OS) the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation). On standard [[x86]] computers, this is a form of [[general protection fault]]. The OS [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] will, in response, usually perform some corrective action, generally passing the fault on to the offending [[Process (computing)|process]] by sending the process a [[signal (computing)|signal]]. Processes can in some cases install a custom signal handler, allowing them to recover on their own,<ref name=\"Peter Van der Linden\">''Expert C programming: deep C secrets'' By Peter Van der Linden, page 188</ref> but otherwise the OS default signal handler is used, generally causing [[abnormal termination]] of the process (a program [[Crash (computing)|crash]]), and sometimes a [[core dump]].\n\nSegmentation faults are a common class of error in programs written in languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] that provide low-level memory access. They arise primarily due to errors in use of [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s for [[virtual memory]] addressing, particularly illegal access.

Thus attempting to read outside of the program's address space, or writing to a read-only segment of the address space, results in a segmentation fault, hence the name.\n\nOn systems using hardware [[memory segmentation]] to provide [[virtual memory]], a segmentation fault occurs when the hardware detects an attempt to refer to a non-existent segment, or to refer to a location outside the bounds of a segment, or to refer to a location in a fashion not allowed by the permissions granted for that segment.  On systems using only [[paging]], an [[invalid page fault]] generally leads to a segmentation fault, and segmentation faults and page faults are both faults raised by the [[virtual memory]] management system. Segmentation faults can also occur independently of page faults: illegal access to a valid page is a segmentation fault, but not an invalid page fault, and segmentation faults can occur in the middle of a page (hence no page fault), for example in a [[buffer overflow]] that stays within a page but illegally overwrites memory.\n\nAt the hardware level, the fault is initially raised by the [[memory management unit]] (MMU) on illegal access (if the referenced memory exists), as part of its memory protection feature, or an [[invalid page fault]] (if the referenced memory does not exist). If the problem is not an invalid logical address but instead an invalid physical address, a [[bus error]] is raised instead, though these are not always distinguished.\n\nAt the operating system level, this fault is caught and a signal is passed on to the offending process, activating the process's handler for that signal. Different operating systems have different signal names to indicate that a segmentation fault has occurred. On [[Unix-like]] operating systems, a signal called SIGSEGV (abbreviated from ''segmentation violation'') is sent to the offending process. On [[Microsoft Windows]], the offending process receives a STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION [[exception handling|exception]].\n\n== Causes ==\nThe conditions under which segmentation violations occur and how they manifest themselves are specific to hardware and the operating system: different hardware raises different faults for given conditions, and different operating systems convert these to different signals that are passed on to processes. The proximate cause is a memory access violation, while the underlying cause is generally a [[software bug]] of some sort. Determining the [[root cause]] \u2013 [[debugging]] the bug \u2013 can be simple in some cases, where the program will consistently cause a segmentation fault (e.g., dereferencing a [[null pointer]]), while in other cases the bug can be difficult to reproduce and depend on memory allocation on each run (e.g., dereferencing a [[dangling pointer]]).\n\nThe following are some typical causes of a segmentation fault:\n* Attempting to access a nonexistent memory address (outside process's address space)\n* Attempting to access memory the program does not have rights to (such as kernel structures in process context)\n* Attempting to write read-only memory (such as code segment)\nThese in turn are often caused by programming errors that result in invalid memory access:\n* Dereferencing a [[null pointer]], which usually points to an address that's not part of the process's address space\n* Dereferencing or assigning to an uninitialized pointer ([[wild pointer]], which points to a random memory address)\n* Dereferencing or assigning to a freed pointer ([[dangling pointer]], which points to memory that has been freed/deallocated/deleted)\n* A [[buffer overflow]]\n* A [[stack overflow]]\n* Attempting to execute a program that does not compile correctly. (Some compilers will output an [[executable file]] despite the presence of compile-time errors.)\n\nIn C code, segmentation faults most often occur because of errors in pointer use, particularly in [[C dynamic memory allocation]]. Dereferencing a null pointer will always result in a segmentation fault, but wild pointers and dangling pointers point to memory that may or may not exist, and may or may not be readable or writable, and thus can result in transient bugs. For example:\n<source lang=c>\nchar *p1 = NULL;           // Null pointer\nchar *p2;                  // Wild pointer: not initialized at all.\nchar *p3  = malloc(10 * sizeof(char));  // Initialized pointer to allocated memory\n                                        // (assuming malloc did not fail)\nfree(p3);                  // p3 is now a dangling pointer, as memory has been freed\n</source>\nNow, dereferencing any of these variables could cause a segmentation fault: dereferencing the null pointer generally will cause a segfault, while reading from the wild pointer may instead result in random data but no segfault, and reading from the dangling pointer may result in valid data for a while, and then random data as it is overwritten.\n\n== Handling ==\n\nThe default action for a segmentation fault or bus error is [[abnormal termination]] of the process that triggered it. A [[core file]] may be generated to aid debugging, and other platform-dependent actions may also be performed. For example, [[Linux]] systems using the grsecurity patch may log SIGSEGV signals in order to monitor for possible intrusion attempts using [[buffer overflow]]s.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Card reader segfault.jpg|thumb|right|Segmentation fault on an [[EMV]] keypad]]\n\n=== Writing to read-only memory ===\nWriting to read-only memory raises a segmentation fault. At the level of code errors, this occurs when the program writes to part of its own [[code segment]] or the read-only portion of the [[data segment]], as these are loaded by the OS into read-only memory.\n\nHere is an example of [[ANSI C]] code that will generally cause a segmentation fault on platforms with memory protection. It attempts to modify a [[string literal]], which is undefined behavior according to the ANSI C standard. Most [[compiler]]s will not catch this at compile time, and instead compile this to executable code that will crash:\n\n<source lang=c>\nint main(void)\n{\n    char *s = \"hello world\";\n    *s = 'H';\n}\n</source>\n\nWhen the program containing this code is compiled, the string \"hello world\" is placed in the [[rodata]] section of the program [[executable file]]: the read-only section of the [[data segment]]. When loaded, the operating system places it with other strings and [[constant (programming)|constant]] data in a read-only segment of memory. When executed, a variable, ''s'', is set to point to the string's location, and an attempt is made to write an ''H'' character through the variable into the memory, causing a segmentation fault. Compiling such a program with a compiler that does not check for the assignment of read-only locations at compile time, and running it on a Unix-like operating system produces the following [[runtime error]]:\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ gcc segfault.c -g -o segfault\n$ ./segfault\nSegmentation fault\n</source>\n\n[[Backtrace]] of the core file from [[GDB]]:\n\n<source lang=c>\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x1c0005c2 in main () at segfault.c:6\n6               *s = 'H';\n</source>\n\nThis code can be corrected by using an array instead of a character pointer, as this allocates memory on stack and initializes it to the value of the string literal:\n<source lang=c>\nchar s[] = \"hello world\";\ns[0] = 'H';  // equivalently, *s = 'H';\n</source>\nEven though string literals should not be modified (this has undefined behavior in the C standard), in C they are of <code>static char []</code> type,<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO/IEC 9899:1990 - Programming languages -- C|section=6.1.4 String literals}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 - Programming languages -- C|section=6.4.5 String literals}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=ISO/IEC 9899:2011 - Programming languages -- C|section=6.4.5 String literals|url=http://www.iso-9899.info/n1570.html#6.4.5p6}}</ref> so there is no implicit conversion in the original code (which points a <code>char *</code> at that array), while in C++ they are of <code>static const char []</code> type, and thus there is an implicit conversion, so compilers will generally catch this particular error.\n\n=== Null pointer dereference ===\nIn C and C-like languages, [[null pointer]]s are used to mean \"pointer to no object\" and as an error indicator, and [[dereferencing]] a null pointer (a read or write through a null pointer) is a very common program error. The C standard does not say that the null pointer is the same as the pointer to [[memory address]]&nbsp;0, though that may be the case in practice. Most operating systems map the null pointer's address such that accessing it causes a segmentation fault. This behavior is not guaranteed by the C standard. Dereferencing a null pointer is [[undefined behavior]] in C, and a conforming implementation is allowed to assume that any pointer that is dereferenced is not null.\n\n<source lang=c>\nint *ptr = NULL;\nprintf(\"%d\", *ptr);\n</source>\n\nThis sample code creates a [[null pointer]], and then tries to access its value (read the value). Doing so causes a segmentation fault at runtime on many operating systems.\n\nDereferencing a null pointer and then assigning to it (writing a value to a non-existent target) also usually causes a segmentation fault:\n<source lang=c>\nint *ptr = NULL;\n*ptr = 1;\n</source>\n\nThe following code includes a null pointer dereference, but when compiled will often not result in a segmentation fault, as the value is unused and thus the dereference will often be optimized away by [[dead code elimination]]:\n<source lang=c>\nint *ptr = NULL;\n*ptr;\n</source>\n\n=== Buffer overflow ===\n{{Main|Buffer overflow}}\n\n=== Stack overflow ===\n{{Main|Stack overflow}}\nAnother example is [[recursion]] without a base case:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint main(void)\n{\n    main();\n    return 0;\n}\n</source>\n\nwhich causes the [[stack overflow|stack to overflow]] which results in a segmentation fault.<ref>[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2685413/what-is-the-difference-between-a-segmentation-fault-and-a-stack-overflow/2685434#2685434 What is the difference between a segmentation fault and a stack overflow?] at [[Stack Overflow]]</ref>  Infinite recursion may not necessarily result in a stack overflow depending on the language, optimizations performed by the compiler and the exact structure of a code.  In this case, the behavior of unreachable code (the return statement) is undefined, so the compiler can eliminate it and use a [[tail call]] optimization that might result in no stack usage.  Other optimizations could include translating the recursion into iteration, which given the structure of the example function would result in the program running forever, while probably not overflowing its stack.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Core dump]]\n* [[General protection fault]]\n* [[Page fault]]\n* [[Storage violation]]\n* [[Guru Meditation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [https://www.encious.com/process Process: focus boundary and segmentation fault]\n* [http://www.faqs.org/qa/qa-673.html A FAQ: User contributed answers regarding the definition of a segmentation fault]\n* [http://c-faq.com/null/null1.html A \"null pointer\" explained]\n* [http://c-faq.com/null/varieties.html Answer to: NULL is guaranteed to be 0, but the null pointer is not?]\n* [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/signal.h.html The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6 signal.h]\n\n{{Operating System}}\n{{Error messages}}\n\n[[Category:Articles with example C code]]\n[[Category:Computer errors]]\n[[Category:Memory management]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Segfault|the website|Segfault (website)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2011}}\nIn [[computing]], a '''segmentation fault''' (often shortened to '''segfault''') or '''access violation''' is a [[Fault (computing)|fault]], or failure condition, raised by hardware with [[memory protection]], notifying an [[operating system]] (OS) the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation).

The five-bedroom home was opened on June 14, 1890, by [[Kal\u0101kaua|King Kal\u0101kaua]] and Queen Kapi{{okina}}olani. Only six babies were born at the home the first year since Native Hawaiian women remained suspicious of doctors and institutions.\n* In 1917, the society purchased the adjacent August Dreier property southeast of ''Ululani'' on Beretania Street.\n* In 1918, the home moved to a two-story house with 25 beds at 1538 S. Beretania Street, changed its name to the '''Kapi{{okina}}olani Maternity Home''', and opened its doors to women of other than Hawaiian descent.\n* In 1927, the trustees purchased the property of Dr. John Whitney on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets to build a new maternity home.\n* In 1928, groundbreaking ceremonies for the new maternity home were held on June 28.\n* In 1929, the home moved on March 26 to a new larger building with 50 beds (in twenty-two private rooms, four 2-bedrooms, and two wards) located on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets and expanded its functions to include non-infectious gynecological problems. The original Whitney home was converted to a nurses' home.\n* In 1931, its name was changed to the '''Kapi{{okina}}olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital'''.\n* In 1939, after purchasing the adjacent Spalding property south of the hospital on Punahou Street, the Spalding home was converted into a nurses' home named the Kekaulike Nurses' Home.\n* In 1945, the hospital, at 1611 Bingham Street, finished construction of the two-story Ewa wing that doubled its capacity to 110 beds.\n* In 1957, the hospital completed a new and enlarged nursery.\n* In 1961, future [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] was born in the hospital on August 4.<ref>{{cite news |author=Maraniss, David |date=August 24, 2008 |title=Though Obama had to leave to find himself, it is Hawaii that made his rise possible |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=A22 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/23/AR2008082301620.html |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Serafin, Peter |date=March 21, 2004 |title=Punahou grad stirs up Illinois politics |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/03/21/news/story4.html |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Hoover, Will |date=November 9, 2008 |title=Obama's Hawaii boyhood homes drawing gawkers |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |page=A1 |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Nov/09/ln/hawaii811090361.html |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |quote=Birthplaces and boyhood homes of U.S. presidents have been duly noted and honored}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= |date=January 24, 2009 |title=Kapi' olani Health Foundation, The Centennial Dinner January 24, 2009 |location=Honolulu |publisher=Kapiolani Health Foundation |url=http://www.kapiolanigift.org/the_centennial_dinner.aspx |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Nakaso, Dan |date=December 22, 2008 | title=Twin sisters, Obama on parallel paths for years |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |page=B1 |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Dec/22/ln/hawaii812220320.html |accessdate=March 1, 2009}}</ref>\n* In 1966, the hospital completed a new four-story Lani Ward Booth wing on Punahou Street, with the top two floors left as shells, capacity remained at 110 beds.\n* In 1970, the hospital finished the fourth floor of the Lani Booth wing on Punahou Street, capacity increased to 138 beds.\n* In 1971, its name was changed to '''Kapi{{okina}}olani Hospital'''.\n* In 1974, the hospital began a major rebuilding project, adding an eleven-story hospital and medical office tower on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham Streets, a three-story building, and a parking structure for a combined Kapi{{okina}}olani/Children's Medical Center.\n* In 1976, the new tower was dedicated and Kapi{{okina}}olani patients were moved to its second and fourth floors.\n* In 1977, a section of the original 1929 building was torn down and tiles from its roof were sold to commemorate the 145,000 babies born under it from 1929 to 1977.\n\n===Kauikeolani Children's Hospital===\n[[File:Kapiolani Neonatal ICU.jpg|thumb|The [[Neonatal intensive-care unit|Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]] (NICU) at Kapi{{okina}}olani Medical Center]]\n* In 1908, [[Albert Spencer Wilcox]] (1844\u20131919) gave $55,000 and other private subscribers gave an additional $50,000 to buy several acres of land and erect a two-story comparatively small, homelike children's hospital (with preference given to Hawaiian children) at 226 N. Kuakini Street, named after Wilcox's wife, Emma Kauikeolani Napoliean Mahelona (1862\u20131931).

{"title_page": "Nagle's algorithm", "text_new": "{{ref improve|date=June 2014}}\n'''Nagle's algorithm''' is a  means of improving the efficiency of [[TCP/IP]] networks by reducing the number of packets that need to be sent over the network. It was defined by John Nagle while working for [[Ford Aerospace]]. It was published in 1984 as a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) with title ''Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks'' (see RFC 896).\n\nThe RFC describes what he called the \"small-packet problem\", where an application repeatedly emits data in small chunks, frequently only 1 [[byte]] in size. Since [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] packets have a 40-byte header (20 bytes for TCP, 20 bytes for [[IPv4]]), this results in a 41-byte packet for 1 byte of useful information, a huge overhead. This situation often occurs in [[Telnet]] sessions, where most keypresses generate a single byte of data that is transmitted immediately. Worse, over slow links, many such packets can be in transit at the same time, potentially leading to [[congestion collapse]].\n\nNagle's algorithm works by combining a number of small outgoing messages and sending them all at once. Specifically, as long as there is a sent packet for which the sender has received no acknowledgment, the sender should keep buffering its output until it has a full packet's worth of output, thus allowing output to be sent all at once.\n\n==Algorithm==\n\nThe RFC defines the algorithm as\n<blockquote>\ninhibit the sending of new TCP segments when new outgoing data arrives from the user if any previously transmitted data on the connection remains unacknowledged.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhere MSS is the [[maximum segment size]], the largest segment that can be sent on this connection, and the [[Sliding window protocol|window size]] is the currently acceptable window of unacknowledged data, this can be written in pseudocode as{{Citation needed|reason=not how it is defined in RFC|date=July 2017}}\n '''if''' there is new data to send '''then'''\n     '''if''' the window size \u2265 MSS '''and''' available data is \u2265 MSS '''then'''\n         send complete MSS segment now\n     '''else'''\n         '''if''' there is unconfirmed data still in the pipe '''then'''\n             enqueue data in the buffer until an acknowledge is received\n         '''else'''\n             send data immediately\n         '''end if'''\n     '''end if'''\n '''end if'''\n\nThis algorithm interacts badly with [[TCP delayed acknowledgment]]s (delayed ACK), a feature introduced into TCP at roughly the same time in the early 1980s, but by a different group. With both algorithms enabled, applications that do two successive writes to a TCP connection, followed by a read that will not be fulfilled until after the data from the second write has reached the destination, experience a constant delay of up to 500 milliseconds, the \"[[ACK (TCP)|ACK]] delay\". For this reason, TCP implementations usually provide applications with an interface to disable the Nagle algorithm. This is typically called the <code>TCP_NODELAY</code> option. On Microsoft Windows the <code>TcpNoDelay</code> registry switch decides the default.\n\nA solution recommended by Nagle is to avoid the algorithm sending premature packets by buffering up application writes and then flushing the buffer:<ref>{{cite | url=http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=174457&threshold=1&commentsort=0&mode=thread&cid=14515105 | title=Boosting Socket Performance on Linux | publisher=Slashdot | author=John Nagle | date=January 19, 2006}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe user-level solution is to avoid write\u2013write\u2013read sequences on sockets. Write\u2013read\u2013write\u2013read is fine. Write\u2013write\u2013write is fine. But write\u2013write\u2013read is a killer. So, if you can, buffer up your little writes to TCP and send them all at once. Using the standard UNIX I/O package and flushing write before each read usually works.\n</blockquote>\n\nNagle considers delayed ACKs a \"bad idea\", since the application layer does not usually respond within the time window.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nagle|first1=John|title=Sigh. If you're doing bulk file transfers, you never hit that problem. (reply 9048947)|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9048947|website=Hacker News|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> On the protocol level, he recommends disabling \"delayed ACK\" (for example, by <code>TCP_QUICKACK</code> on Linux) instead of his algorithm, as \"quick\" ACKs do not incur as much overhead as many small packets do.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nagle|first1=John|title=That fixed 200ms ACK delay timer was a horrible mistake. Why 200ms? Human reaction time. (reply 9050645)|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9050645|website=Hacker News|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> On [[Microsoft Windows]], Setting <code>TcpAckFrequency</code> to 1 in the registry would have the same effect. A related undocumented value, <code>TcpAckFrequency</code>, controls the max time-to-delay for ACKs. It can be set to zero to disable delayed ACKS as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/328890/new-registry-entry-for-controlling-the-tcp-acknowledgment-ack-behavior |title=New registry entry for controlling the TCP Acknowledgment (ACK) behavior in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Negative effect on larger writes==\nThe algorithm applies to data of any size. If the data in a single write spans 2''n'' packets, the last packet will be withheld, waiting for the ACK for the previous packet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/NagleDelayedAck/ |title=TCP Performance problems caused by interaction between Nagle's Algorithm and Delayed ACK |publisher=Stuartcheshire.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref> In any request-response application protocols where request data can be larger than a packet, this can artificially impose a few hundred milliseconds latency between the requester and the responder, even if the requester has properly buffered the request data. Nagle's algorithm should be disabled by the requester in this case. If the response data can be larger than a packet, the responder should also disable Nagle's algorithm so the requester can promptly receive the whole response.\n\nIn general, since Nagle's algorithm is only a defense against careless applications, it will not benefit a carefully written application that takes proper care of buffering; the algorithm has either no effect, or negative effect on the application.\n\n==Interactions with real-time systems==\nApplications that expect real-time responses and low [[latency (engineering)|latency]] can react poorly with Nagle's algorithm.

It was defined by John Nagle while working for [[Ford Aerospace]]. It was published in 1984 as a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) with title ''Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks'' (see RFC 896).\n\nThe RFC describes what he called the \"small-packet problem\", where an application repeatedly emits data in small chunks, frequently only 1 [[byte]] in size. Since [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] packets have a 40-byte header (20 bytes for TCP, 20 bytes for [[IPv4]]), this results in a 41-byte packet for 1 byte of useful information, a huge overhead. This situation often occurs in [[Telnet]] sessions, where most keypresses generate a single byte of data that is transmitted immediately. Worse, over slow links, many such packets can be in transit at the same time, potentially leading to [[congestion collapse]].\n\nNagle's algorithm works by combining a number of small outgoing messages and sending them all at once. Specifically, as long as there is a sent packet for which the sender has received no acknowledgment, the sender should keep buffering its output until it has a full packet's worth of output, thus allowing output to be sent all at once.\n\n==Algorithm==\n\nThe RFC defines the algorithm as\n<blockquote>\ninhibit the sending of new TCP segments when new outgoing data arrives from the user if any previously transmitted data on the connection remains unacknowledged.\n</blockquote>\n\nWhere MSS is the [[maximum segment size]], the largest segment that can be sent on this connection, and the [[Sliding window protocol|window size]] is the currently acceptable window of unacknowledged data, this can be written in pseudocode as{{Citation needed|reason=not how it is defined in RFC|date=July 2017}}\n '''if''' there is new data to send '''then'''\n     '''if''' the window size \u2265 MSS '''and''' available data is \u2265 MSS '''then'''\n         send complete MSS segment now\n     '''else'''\n         '''if''' there is unconfirmed data still in the pipe '''then'''\n             enqueue data in the buffer until an acknowledge is received\n         '''else'''\n             send data immediately\n         '''end if'''\n     '''end if'''\n '''end if'''\n\nThis algorithm interacts badly with [[TCP delayed acknowledgment]]s (delayed ACK), a feature introduced into TCP at roughly the same time in the early 1980s, but by a different group. With both algorithms enabled, applications that do two successive writes to a TCP connection, followed by a read that will not be fulfilled until after the data from the second write has reached the destination, experience a constant delay of up to 500 milliseconds, the \"[[ACK (TCP)|ACK]] delay\". For this reason, TCP implementations usually provide applications with an interface to disable the Nagle algorithm. This is typically called the <code>TCP_NODELAY</code> option. On Microsoft Windows the <code>TcpNoDelay</code> registry switch decides the default.\n\nA solution recommended by Nagle is to avoid the algorithm sending premature packets by buffering up application writes and then flushing the buffer:<ref>{{cite | url=http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=174457&threshold=1&commentsort=0&mode=thread&cid=14515105 | title=Boosting Socket Performance on Linux | publisher=Slashdot | author=John Nagle | date=January 19, 2006}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe user-level solution is to avoid write-write-read sequences on sockets. write-read-write-read is fine. write-write-write is fine. But write-write-read is a killer. So, if you can, buffer up your little writes to TCP and send them all at once. Using the standard UNIX I/O package and flushing write before each read usually works.\n</blockquote>\n\nNagle considers delayed ACKs a \"bad idea\", since the application layer does not usually respond within the time window.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nagle|first1=John|title=Sigh. If you're doing bulk file transfers, you never hit that problem. (reply 9048947)|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9048947|website=Hacker News|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> On the protocol level, he recommends disabling \"delayed ACK\" (for example, by <code>TCP_QUICKACK</code> on Linux) instead of his algorithm, as \"quick\" ACKs do not incur as much overhead as many small packets do.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nagle|first1=John|title=That fixed 200ms ACK delay timer was a horrible mistake. Why 200ms? Human reaction time. (reply 9050645)|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9050645|website=Hacker News|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> On [[Microsoft Windows]], Setting <code>TcpAckFrequency</code> to 1 in the registry would have the same effect. A related undocumented value, <code>TcpAckFrequency</code>, controls the max time-to-delay for ACKs. It can be set to zero to disable delayed ACKS as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/328890/new-registry-entry-for-controlling-the-tcp-acknowledgment-ack-behavior |title=New registry entry for controlling the TCP Acknowledgment (ACK) behavior in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Negative effect on larger writes==\nThe algorithm applies to data of any size. If the data in a single write spans 2''n'' packets, the last packet will be withheld, waiting for the ACK for the previous packet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/NagleDelayedAck/ |title=TCP Performance problems caused by interaction between Nagle's Algorithm and Delayed ACK |publisher=Stuartcheshire.org |date= |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}</ref> In any request-response application protocols where request data can be larger than a packet, this can artificially impose a few hundred milliseconds latency between the requester and the responder, even if the requester has properly buffered the request data. Nagle's algorithm should be disabled by the requester in this case. If the response data can be larger than a packet, the responder should also disable Nagle's algorithm so the requester can promptly receive the whole response.\n\nIn general, since Nagle's algorithm is only a defense against careless applications, it will not benefit a carefully written application that takes proper care of buffering; the algorithm has either no effect, or negative effect on the application.\n\n==Interactions with real-time systems==\nApplications that expect real-time responses and low [[latency (engineering)|latency]] can react poorly with Nagle's algorithm. Applications such as networked multiplayer video games or the movement of the mouse in a remotely controlled operating system, expect that actions are sent immediately, while the algorithm purposefully delays transmission, increasing [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] efficiency at the expense of [[latency (engineering)|latency]].
