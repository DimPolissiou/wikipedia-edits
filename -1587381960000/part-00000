Alison decided to keep Phoenix a secret from Chris and the two lived in America. After Alison grew sick of the American schooling system, she and Phoenix travelled to New Zealand and lived on a farm. In November 2009 Alison died on a yacht and Phoenix was taken in by her uncle [[Brian Raynor|Brian]] ([[Ian Mune]]).\n\nChris learnt in August 2010 that Phoenix was his son and, after a DNA test, he adopted him. Phoenix struggled to get on with half brother [[Harry Warner (Shortland Street)|Harry]] ([[Reid Walker]]) but befriended [[Evan Cooper (character)|Evan Cooper]] (Tyler Read). New girl [[Ula Levi]] (Frankie Adams) spread a rumour that he was gay after he rebuffed a kiss from her but the two later dated briefly in 2011. He dumped her for Evan's sister [[Jasmine Cooper|Jasmine]] (Pearl McGlashan) but cheated on Jasmine when he had a one-night stand with [[Suzy McRae|Suzy]] (Maisey McSwiney). Phoenix was shocked when Jasmine died for several minutes on his lap due to her [[Long QT syndrome]] and later struggled to cope with her newfound morbid personality causing the two to break up numerous times. Phoenix ultimately ended the relationship when he developed an unrequited crush on [[List of Shortland Street characters (2012)#Megan Reynolds|Megan]] (Lira Edwards). Phoenix was shocked when Chris was arrested for the murder of his school tutor, [[Hayley O'Neill]] (Michelle Blundell) and struggled to accept his protest of innocence. However he ended up freeing his father when Hayley's true killer [[Drew Webster (Shortland Street)|Drew]] (Joel Herbert) kidnapped him and confessed. In 2013 Phoenix began to date popular schoolgirl [[List of Shortland Street characters (2013)#Britney Buchanan|Britney Buchanan]] (Eliza McKay) but the two broke up after meddling from new girl, [[Dayna Jenkins]] (Lucy Elliott). Phoenix soon turned against his family lifestyle and took up street art to express his true beliefs. This however lead to near legal trouble and in November, Phoenix decided to leave Ferndale to study at a Berlin university for art. Only a month after his departure, Chris revealed that Phoenix had dropped out of the school and had taken to traveling the world. In 2014, Chris stated that Phoenix would not be returning for his wedding but would rather attend via video chat.\n\nPhoenix unexpectedly returned to Ferndale 6 years after his departure and shocked Chris by introducing his heavily pregnant girlfriend [[Tess Hutchison (Shortland Street)|Tess]] (Becky McEwen). Chris soon realised that Phoenix had struggled in Berlin as an artist and was owing significant amounts of money. He hired him as an office administrator much to Phoenix's angst. Tess and Phoenix newborn daughter was born on 2019 season finale they decided to name her Ameila Warner.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, after being talked down by a returning [[Frank Warner (Shortland Street)|Frank Warner]] from leaving Amelia and Tess on the lurch, he decided to put his $10,000 gift from Chris to become an investor for an art gallery in New Zealand, in exchange for a feature exhibition spot. The money was supposed to be the payment for prams, nappies and a modest family car. Despite Franks' displeasure, he was still glad that Phoenix was trying to further his career (even when the investment is rather risky), rather than turning into crime like drugs and gangs, hence Frank didn't turn him in to Tess or Chris.\n\nIn February, after a failure with the art gallery, Phoenix takes $1,000,000 from the hospital and when he confesses to Tess, he wants to make a runner with Tess and his baby. Tess calms him and tells him to stay in Ferndale but he makes a runner and was reported to be in Santiago, Chile last\n\n==Character development==\n===Characterisation===\nPhoenix was initially portrayed as a teenager who although often landed himself in bad situations, was friendly and welcoming to all those he interacted with.<ref name=mathstutor/> He earned the title \"Mr Big Dick\" however a storyline in 2012 that revolved around Phoenix developing a crush on his psychopathic maths tutor [[Hayley O'Neill]] (Michelle Blundell), saw the characterization of the character develop drastically differently. Holibar explained, \"He's grown up, he's sort of had to\". Hayley manipulated Phoenix's affections to try to get closer to his father and ended up accusing Phoenix of sadistically stalking her.<ref name=mathstutor/> This lead to Phoenix being \"angsty and angry\".<ref name=frankreturn/> Holibar enjoyed what the storyline did for his character, \"I've enjoyed it. I like getting angry and I do occasionally. It was fun playing something that wasn't just Phoenix being nice to everyone 24-7, which gets a bit boring to do. It was good to see a darker side as he starts pushing people away and not coping at all with the things going on for him.\"<ref name=mathstutor/> Upon Phoenix's return in 2019, Holibar believed \"adult Phoenix\" was \"flawed\" and was very different from the \"many years ... being very nice\" from his first stint. This conflicted with becoming a father as Phoenix, \"is thinking more of himself than his partner and his child ... and ... it's a big life shift for someone who has been thinking about himself for so long.

At Article 4 it named the locations of seven regional teams and twenty-six teams within those regions in [[South Vietnam]]. It also called for seven teams to be assigned to ports of entry (for replacement of armaments, munitions and war material permitted the two South Vietnamese parties under Article 7 of the Agreement) and seven teams to supervise the return of captured and detained personnel.\n\nIn summary, the ICCS was to supervise the cease-fire, the withdrawal of troops, the dismantlement of military bases, the activity at ports of entry and the return of captured military personnel and foreign civilians. It was to report on the implementation, or violation, of the Peace Agreement and Protocols. The force was composed of military and civilian personnel from two communist nations, Hungary and Poland, and two non-communist nations, Canada and Indonesia. As with the old ICSC, there were continuous disagreements between the [[communist]] and non-communist nations about the causes of treaty violations. Canada attempted to counter this with an \"open mouth policy\" to the world's media.\n\n[[Canada]] remained a member of the ICCS from 29 January until 31 July 1973.

She first gained national recognition in 2017, placing as the runner-up in [[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 9)|series nine]] of the Spanish reality television talent competition ''[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (Spanish TV series)|Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo]]'', behind [[Amaia Romero]]. While competing in ''Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo'', Aitana released the single \"[[Lo malo]]\" with fellow competitor [[Ana Guerra]]. The song went on to become a number-one hit in Spain and was certified five times platinum, additionally being used in [[International Women's Day]] demonstrations in Spain.\n\nFollowing the competition, Aitana signed with [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music Spain]] and released her debut solo single \"[[Tel\u00e9fono]]\", which became her second number-one single. Its music video became the most-watched [[Vevo]] music video within twenty-four hours  of all-time in Spain. Her debut extended play ''[[Tr\u00e1iler]]'' was released in November 2018, becoming her first chart-topping album and the second most-streamed album within twenty-four hours of all-time in Spain.

While competing in ''Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo'', Aitana released the single \"[[Lo malo]]\" with fellow competitor [[Ana Guerra]]. The song went on to become a number-one hit in Spain and was certified five times platinum, additionally being used in [[International Women's Day]] demonstrations in Spain.\n\nFollowing the competition, Aitana signed with [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music Spain]] and released her debut solo single \"[[Tel\u00e9fono]]\", which became her second number-one single. Its music video became the most-watched [[Vevo]] music video within twenty-four hours  of all-time in Spain. Her debut extended play ''[[Tr\u00e1iler]]'' was released in November 2018, becoming her first chart-topping album and the second most-streamed album within twenty-four hours of all-time in Spain. The extended play's second single \"[[Vas a quedarte]]\" became her third chart-topping hit and the most-streamed song in its first twenty-four hours on [[Spotify]] Spain, surpassing the previous record which was also held by her previous release \"Tel\u00e9fono\". Her debut studio album ''[[Spoiler (album)|Spoiler]]'' (2019), was later released in June 2019 and became her second chart-topping album. Then in December 2019 she released the lead single, called \"+\", from her second studio album.

He has also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]] and six [[Filmfare Awards South|South Filmfare Awards]].\n\nCheran initially made a breakthrough as a director by making village-based drama films focusing on human relationships, and achieved critical acclaim for his work in ''[[Bharathi Kannamma]]'' (1997) and ''[[Porkkaalam]]'' (1997). He later moved on to work on themes exploring how globalisation affects the Indian middle class, and told the story of scam job offers in ''[[Vetri Kodi Kattu]]'' (2000) and village-to-city emigration in ''[[Pandavar Bhoomi]]'' (2001).<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20030629114205/http://www.chennaionline.com/entertainment/filmplus/cheran.asp</ref> His most renowned film till date, ''[[Autograph (2004 film)|Autograph]]'' (2004), is a semi-autobiographical tale of a man at four stage of his life. He later also experienced success with the family drama film ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' (2005) and as an actor in films such as ''[[Pirivom Santhippom]]'' (2008) and ''[[Yuddham Sei]]'' (2011).\n\n== Early life ==\nCheran was born in Pazhaiyurpatty village near Madurai. His father Pandian was a film projector operator in [[Vellalur]]'s touring theatre. His mother Kamala was a primary school teacher, and he has two sisters.\n\nHe came to Chennai to pursue a career in films, and was keen to become an actor. Initially, he started career as a production manager in some films. In the film ''[[Puriyaadha Pudhir]]'' (1990), he worked as an assistant director [[K. S. Ravikumar]], and was later promoted to an associate director from ''[[Cheran Pandiyan]]'' (1992) to ''[[Nattamai]]'' (1994).\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1997\u20132003: Breakthrough and early success ===\nCheran made his directorial debut through ''[[Bharathi Kannamma]]'' (1997), a village drama narrating the relationship between the daughter of a rich family and their retainer, starring [[R. Parthiepan|Parthiban]] and [[Meena (actress)|Meena]] in the lead roles. During its release, the film ran into trouble as Thevar community who almost imposed a ban of the film due to its content. However the film won good reviews and performed well at the box office.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Pillai |first=Sreedhar |date=1998 |title=Mandal and movies |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.21002/page/n637 |magazine=Sunday |pages=55\u201357}}</ref> In spite of controversies, the film became successful at box-office.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/2003/12/28/stories/2003122800731400.htm |title=The politics of art |last=Nambath |first=Suresh |date=28 December 2003 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref> His second film, ''[[Porkkaalam]]'' (1997) was in the same genre, and also performed well commercially as well as winning favourable reviews from critics. The film, which explored the life of a hard-working potter and his poor family, earned Cheran an award for best director from the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director|Tamil Nadu State]].\n\nUnlike his first two films, his third film did not fare well at the box office despite winning positive reviews.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/jun/23che.htm</ref> ''[[Desiya Geetham]]'' (1998) told the story of a Chief Minister being kidnapped and taken to a remote village, and it subsequently met with a controversial response from politicians. Despite Cheran's intervention and explanation of the script to senior political figures, the film was quickly removed from cinema halls, much to the director's dismay.<ref>https://archive.is/20120709043545/http://chandrag.tripod.com/nov98/</ref> However, the film won good reviews and a critic noted it was \"a rare, good movie with a message\" and added that Cheran \"deserves credit for making a movie that tries to tell something and keeping away from the usual, commercial add-ons\".<ref>http://www.bbthots.com/reviews/1999/dgeetham.html</ref><ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/review.htm</ref> Following the film's failure, Cheran announced several projects before opting not to continue with them. He initially considered making another film with [[Murali (Tamil actor)|Murali]] and [[Shammi Kapoor]] titled ''Paraseega Mannan'', but the film did not progress.<ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/gcnapril.htm</ref> Cheran then moved on make an urban love story titled ''Inniya Kaadalargale'' starring [[Prashanth (actor)|Prashanth]], Shivani and himself in the lead roles, but the film was also later dropped.<ref>http://chandrag.tripod.com/jan99/</ref> Another light-hearted film was planned with [[Arun Vijay|Arunkumar]], [[Suriya]] and [[Raju Sundaram]], but it did not start production.<ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/rangan.htm</ref>\n\nHe later worked again with Parthiban and Murali for the social comedy drama, ''[[Vetri Kodi Kattu]]'' (2000), which focused on scams committed by agents who promised lavish jobs and salaries abroad, and in the process swindling the money of innocent people. The film won critical acclaim upon release, and Cheran won a [[National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues|National Film Award]] for his work in the film.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#4</ref> Cheran then made ''[[Pandavar Bhoomi]]'' (2001) with actors [[Arun Vijay|Arunkumar]] and [[Rajkiran]], which explored themes of wholesale emigration of villagers to the city and the loss of good, solid agricultural lands, culture and solidarity.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#5</ref> The film performed well at the box office and garnered mixed reviews from critics. A reviewer from Sify.com stated the film was \"typical overdose of Cheran melodrama masala\".<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/pandavar-bhoomi-review--pclulBgcjfigc.html</ref> Cheran then turned actor in director [[Thangar Bachan]]'s romantic drama film ''[[Solla Marandha Kadhai]]'' (2002). The film garnered mixed review but performed well at the box office.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/solla-marantha-kathai-review-tamil-pcluw5aeghgbd.html</ref>\n\n=== 2003\u20132006: ''Autograph'' and national recognition ===\nCheran first began work on ''Autograph'' in 2001 with [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]], though the actor later opted out as a result of schedule clashes.<ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/may2001.html</ref> In early 2002, Cheran announced that he was going to instead make a film titled ''Pokkisham'' and [[Kanika (actress)|Kanika]] would star alongside him. However he failed to find a financier and moved back to making ''Autograph''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nilacharal.com/enter/cinebit/c97.html|title=Nilacharal&nbsp;\u2013 A Tamil entertainment ezine presenting interesting contents and useful services|publisher=}}</ref> As producers were unwilling to finance the film, Cheran opted to produce and star in the film himself and the film consequently took over a year to make. ''Autograph'' told the story of a man named Senthil, presented in four stages of his life&nbsp;\u2013 at school, college, work and during his marriage, and Cheran called the film \"semi-autobiographical\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">http://www.sify.com/movies/malayalam/interview.php?id=13429274&cid=2408</ref> The film starred him alongside [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]], [[Gopika]], [[Mallika (actress)|Mallika]] and Kanika, and had a popular soundtrack composed by [[Bharathwaj]]. Four different cinematographers worked on the film; [[Ravi Varman]] had shot the school episode in Senthil's early life with a 35&nbsp;mm lens, [[Vijay Milton]] shot the Kerala scenes, Dwaraknath shot the Chennai episode with a steady cam and Shanky Mahendran shot the \"'live' part\" of the film when the camera uses the [[Point of view shot|point of view]] of Senthil's character.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nMade at a budget of \u20b92 crore rupees, the film garnered over \u20b910 crores at the box office and became one of the most profitable Tamil films of the year. The film benefited from positive word-of-mouth and Cheran subsequently increased the number of prints from sixty five to eighty five for the second week, a rarity in Tamil cinema.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/year-2004-a-flashback/article28578111.ece</ref> The film won positive reviews from film critics, with [[Sify]].com writing that \"Cheran has used all his artists to perfection to make this love story with polish and panache\".<ref>http://www.sify.com/movies/autograph-review--pclv0vfgdgghh.html</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote it was a \"well-mounted production has too much familiar melodrama, and few real highlights (notably one delightful homage to \u201970s Tamil musicals), but remains an easy watch\".<ref>https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/autograph-2-1200531283/</ref> For the film, Cheran won a [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment|National Award for Best Popular Film]], along with two [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]] and two [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]], for Best Film and Best Director.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/cheran-and-awards-news-tamil-kkfvbgifchhsi.html</ref> The film became renowned as a \"cult classic\" and spawned several other inspirations and remakes in the Indian film industry.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#6</ref>\n\nCheran then restarted work ''Pokkisham'' in 2004 but postponed the film after falling out with the new lead actress [[Meera Jasmine]]. He then the drama film ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' (2005) focused on family relationships and Tamil culture, and cast himself in the lead role, alongside [[Rajkiran]], [[Saranya Ponvannan|Saranya]] and [[Padmapriya Janakiraman|Padmapriya]]. During production, the film went over budget and took nearly 145 days of shoot in Karaikudi, Madurai and Chennai. The film was made at a budget of \u20b92 crore rupees, and went on to make profits for the producers.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/interview.php?id=14045327&cid=2408</ref> The film also won positive reviews, with a critic from Sify.com noting that \"Cheran has kept the flag of uncompromised cinema flying and is one of the handful of directors, whose calling card remain his artistry over the medium\", adding that the film is \"brilliant and appeals as much to the mind as the heart\".<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/thavamai-thavamirundhu-review-tamil-pclvObfhagcjb.html</ref> Upon release, the film won several awards including the [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare|another National Award]] for best film on family welfare.<ref>http://dff.nic.in/2011/53rd_nff_2006.pdf</ref>\n\n=== 2007\u20132013: Focus on acting assignments ===\nHe restarted work on ''Pokkisham'' for the third time in December 2005, after completing ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' (2005), and approached [[Sandhya (actress)|Sandhya]] to play the lead role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid%3D389 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422133146/http://tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid=389 |archivedate=22 April 2016  }}</ref> The film did not take off so he moved on to make ''[[Maya Kannadi]]'' (2007) starring himself and [[Navya Nair]] in the lead roles. ''Mayakannadi'' was based on the concept of middle class dreams turning sour due to lack of commitment and created attention prior to release owing to Cheran's recent success. However, the film fared poorly at the box office and lost money for distributors.<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news/may-07-01/03-05-07-maayakannadi.html</ref> It received mixed reviews and a critic noted \"after seeing the film, we hope that the director applies this message in his life by sticking to his core strength of direction rather than dabble in roles that just do not suit him\".<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#8</ref> Another reviewer from Rediff.com stated it was a \"brave, real film\" and that \"Cheran has done a superb job directing as well as acting\".<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/apr/16ssmaya.htm</ref> After the film's release, Cheran suggested that he regretted not thinking about letting someone else play the lead role instead of himself.<ref>https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:BijMP9VxalAJ:https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cheran-on-directing-thirumanam/article26365860.ece+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk</ref>\n\nCheran subsequently chose to prioritise acting commitments in order to raise finances for his subsequent film. He starred in [[T. V. Chandran]]'s award-winning ''[[Aadum Koothu]]'' (2008), [[Karu Pazhaniappan]]'s ''[[Pirivom Santhippom]]'' (2008) and ''[[Raman Thediya Seethai (2008 film)|Raman Thediya Seethai]]'' (2009). In his films, he often portrayed meek and mellow roles as a family-orientated man. The films all performed well commercially, and won good reviews for Cheran as an actor.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/19ssr.htm</ref><ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-reviews/reviews-2/raman-thediya-seethai-review.html</ref> For the fourth time, Cheran finally moved on to make ''Pokkisham'' (2009) and cast [[Padmapriya Janakiraman|Padmapriya]] alongside himself in the lead role during 2008. Set in the 1970s, the story revolved around two lovers&nbsp;\u2013 a Muslim Tamil literature student and a Hindu marine engineer working in Calcutta. ''Pokkisham'' opened to mixed reviews from critics, with many reviewers calling the screenplay too slow. The film subsequently fared poorly at the box office.<ref>http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/aug/21/slide-show-1-south-cheran-on-pokkisham.htm#1</ref>\n\nFollowing the commercial failure of ''Pokkisham'', Cheran actively chose to prioritise acting commitments. He appeared in [[Mysskin]]'s thriller ''[[Yuddham Sei]]'' as a detective agent, and in Rajan Madhav's mystery drama ''[[Muran (film)|Muran]]'' during 2011. In 2013, he featured in [[Vasanth]]'s ''[[Moondru Per Moondru Kaadhal]]'' and in the anthology film ''[[Chennaiyil Oru Naal]]''. In general, all four films won positive reviews from critics and performed well commercially.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/report/south-review-yuddham-sei/20110204.htm</ref><ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/thriller-yudham-sei-is-value-for-money-tamil-movie-review-news-national-lcgtEfadiifsi.html</ref><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chen-cinema/life-comes-full-circle/article4636636.ece</ref>\n\n=== 2014\u2014present: Career decline ===\nFollowing successive failures as a director, Cheran had trouble attracting producers for his next directorial projects. He also revealed his intentions of making bigger budget films to cater to modern audiences and expressed that village-based films would be difficult, as the setting had changed considerably since the start of his career. He subsequently launched a film titled ''[[JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai]]'' in 2013 starring [[Sharwanand]] and [[Nithya Menen]] in the lead roles. However, the film languished in development hell and later had a straight-to-DVD release via Cheran's C2H platform.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/jk-ennum-nanbanin-vazhkai-review-tamil-pdhs4giheeghd.html</ref><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/audio-beat-jk-ennum-nanbanin-vazhkai-a-slice-of-life/article5228673.ece</ref> The period marked a difficult stage for the director, with the lack of directing and acting offers, complemented by family trouble, financial problems owing to C2H, and negative press for controversial statements.<ref name=\"deccanchronicle.com\">https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/270816/director-cheran-hit-by-diaspora.html</ref>\n\nAfter an extended break, Cheran made a return to direction with the family drama ''[[Thirumanam (2019 film)|Thirumanam]]'' (2019) starring himself alongside [[Sukanya (actress)|Sukanya]], Umapathi Ramaiah and Kavya Shetty. The film focused on marriage between young people, and Cheran suggested that the film would urge the youth to consider some of the societal factors before entering into wedlock.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\">https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cheran-on-directing-thirumanam/article26365860.ece</ref> The film opened to negative reviews, and fared poorly at the box office. A critic noted \"the basic problem with ''Thirumanam'' is the preachy tone of the film\" and that \"Cheran uses lengthy dialogues and songs to convey his thoughts, which often tests our patience\", concluding that the film \"is certainly not for audiences who like modern dramas\".<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/thirumanam-review-preachy-and-tiresome-review-tamil-tdbjC2hijaaif.html</ref><ref>https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/thirumanam-movie-review-rating-cheran-5606816/</ref><ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/after-underwhelming-performance-cheran-s-thirumanam-to-re-release-1490161-2019-03-30</ref>\n\n== Other ventures ==\n=== Cinema2Home ===\nIn 2014, Cheran founded a new cinema distribution platform known as \"C2H\" (Cinema2Home) in an attempt to curb out copyright infringement in the Tamil film industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/cherans-idea-to-bring-the-movies-home/article6204850.ece|title=Cheran\u2019s idea to bring the movies home|date=13 July 2014|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/C2H-set-to-invade-your-drawing-room/articleshow/45942037.cms|title=C2H set to invade your drawing room&nbsp;\u2013 Times of India|publisher=}}</ref> He also launched his own music company 'Dream Sounds' in 2013, which released the soundtrack album of ''[[JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai]]'' (2015) and ''[[Thirumanam]]'' (2019).

He later convinced producers who were struggling to find distributors to also put their films forward for a C2H release. Other films which joined included Thangasamy's ''[[Ettuthikkum Madhayaanai]]'', [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]]'s ''[[Appavin Meesai]]'', Parthi Bhaskar's ''[[Arjunan Kadhali]]'', Sashidharan's ''[[Vaaraayo Vennilaave]]'', Mahesh Periyasamy's ''Hockey'' and Balan's ''Koditta Idangalai Nirappuga''.

Later, it was published as a book titled ''Touring Talkies'', {{ISBN|81-89780-18-2}}. He later turned publisher with the Tamil novel ''Porum Valiyum'' (War & Pain), a novel on an emotional account of a war-torn Sri Lanka by author Savitri Advithanandhan. As a first step, he launched the publishing house \"Cheran Noolagam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kollytalk.com/cinenews/cheran-launches-publishing-house-cheran-noolagam-79266.html|title=Cheran launches publishing house Cheran Noolagam&nbsp;\u2013 KOLLY TALK|first=|last=admin|date=18 January 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Bigg Boss ===\nIn 2019, Cheran entered the ''[[Bigg Boss Tamil 3|third season]]'' of the popular reality show ''[[Bigg Boss Tamil]]''. He got evicted after 90 days. He also received the \"Most Disciplined\" housemate award from Kamal Hasan.\n\n== Controversies ==\nCheran has often had a difficult relationship with producers and has made controversial statements, which have elicited discussion. In 2008, during the audio release of ''Raman Thediya Seethai'', he made a derogatory statement against press for writing rumours about him.<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/july-08-05/cheran-31-07-08.html</ref><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Cheran-lashes-at-media-apologises/articleshow/3306694.cms</ref> In 2013, he held a press conference asking parents to strictly oppose love marriages, despite having written many love stories in films.

In return, Sharwanand stated that Cheran was in the wrong, was sour because of the failure of the Tamil film and had failed to pay him his salary.<ref>https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/tollywood/050716/silly-row-over-rajadhi-raja.html</ref> In 2016, Cheran blamed Sri Lankan Tamils for being the cause of video piracy in the Tamil film industry and expressed his regret for his support of their political independence movement. His remarks were met with outrage from the Tamil diaspora.<ref name=\"deccanchronicle.com\"/>\n\nIn March 2017, Cheran launched another scathing attack against Vishal and produced a seven-page letter accusing the actor of being \"selfish, power hungry and insensitive\".

He is a three time [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] winner for ''[[Vetri Kodi Kattu]]'' (2000), ''[[Autograph (2004 film)|Autograph]]'' (2004) and ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' (2005). He has also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]] and six [[Filmfare Awards South|South Filmfare Awards]].\n\nCheran initially made a breakthrough as a director by making village-based drama films focusing on human relationships, and achieved critical acclaim for his work in ''[[Bharathi Kannamma]]'' (1997) and ''[[Porkkaalam]]'' (1997). He later moved on to work on themes exploring how globalisation affects the Indian middle class, and told the story of scam job offers in ''[[Vetri Kodi Kattu]]'' (2000) and village-to-city emigration in ''[[Pandavar Bhoomi]]'' (2001).<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20030629114205/http://www.chennaionline.com/entertainment/filmplus/cheran.asp</ref> His most renowned film till date, ''[[Autograph (2004 film)|Autograph]]'' (2004), is a semi-autobiographical tale of a man at four stage of his life. He later also experienced success with the family drama film ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' (2005) and as an actor in films such as ''[[Pirivom Santhippom]]'' (2008) and ''[[Yuddham Sei]]'' (2011).\n\n== Early life ==\nCheran was born in Pazhaiyurpatty village near Madurai. His father Pandian was a film projector operator in [[Vellalur]]'s touring theatre. His mother Kamala was a primary school teacher, and he has two sisters.\n\nHe came to Chennai to pursue a career in films, and was keen to become an actor. Initially, he started career as a production manager in some films. In the film ''[[Puriyaadha Pudhir]]'' (1990), he worked as an assistant director [[K. S. Ravikumar]], and was later promoted to an associate director from ''[[Cheran Pandiyan]]'' (1992) to ''[[Nattamai]]'' (1994).\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1997\u20132003: Breakthrough and early success ===\nCheran made his directorial debut through ''[[Bharathi Kannamma]]'' (1997), a village drama narrating the relationship between the daughter of a rich family and their retainer, starring [[R. Parthiepan|Parthiban]] and [[Meena (actress)|Meena]] in the lead roles. During its release, the film ran into trouble as Thevar community who almost imposed a ban of the film due to its content. However the film won good reviews and performed well at the box office.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Pillai |first=Sreedhar |date=1998 |title=Mandal and movies |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.21002/page/n637 |magazine=Sunday |pages=55\u201357}}</ref> In spite of controversies, the film became successful at box-office.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/2003/12/28/stories/2003122800731400.htm |title=The politics of art |last=Nambath |first=Suresh |date=28 December 2003 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref> His second film, ''[[Porkkaalam]]'' (1997) was in the same genre, and also performed well commercially as well as winning favourable reviews from critics. The film, which explored the life of a hard-working potter and his poor family, earned Cheran an award for best director from the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director|Tamil Nadu State]].\n\nUnlike his first two films, his third film did not fare well at the box office despite winning positive reviews.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/jun/23che.htm</ref> ''[[Desiya Geetham]]'' (1998) told the story of a Chief Minister being kidnapped and taken to a remote village, and it subsequently met with a controversial response from politicians. Despite Cheran's intervention and explanation of the script to senior political figures, the film was quickly removed from cinema halls, much to the director's dismay.<ref>https://archive.is/20120709043545/http://chandrag.tripod.com/nov98/</ref> However, the film won good reviews and a critic noted it was \"a rare, good movie with a message\" and added that Cheran \"deserves credit for making a movie that tries to tell something and keeping away from the usual, commercial add-ons\".<ref>http://www.bbthots.com/reviews/1999/dgeetham.html</ref><ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/review.htm</ref> Following the film's failure, Cheran announced several projects before opting not to continue with them. He initially considered making another film with [[Murali (Tamil actor)|Murali]] and [[Shammi Kapoor]] titled ''Paraseega Mannan'', but the film did not progress.<ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/gcnapril.htm</ref> Cheran then moved on make an urban love story titled ''Inniya Kaadalargale'' starring [[Prashanth (actor)|Prashanth]], Shivani and himself in the lead roles, but the film was also later dropped.<ref>http://chandrag.tripod.com/jan99/</ref> Another light-hearted film was planned with [[Arun Vijay|Arunkumar]], [[Suriya]] and [[Raju Sundaram]], but it did not start production.<ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/rangan.htm</ref>\n\nHe later worked again with Parthiban and Murali for the social comedy drama, ''[[Vetri Kodi Kattu]]'' (2000), which focused on scams committed by agents who promised lavish jobs and salaries abroad, and in the process swindling the money of innocent people. The film won critical acclaim upon release, and Cheran won a [[National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues|National Film Award]] for his work in the film.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#4</ref> Cheran then made ''[[Pandavar Bhoomi]]'' (2001) with actors [[Arun Vijay|Arunkumar]] and [[Rajkiran]], which explored themes of wholesale emigration of villagers to the city and the loss of good, solid agricultural lands, culture and solidarity.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#5</ref> The film performed well at the box office and garnered mixed reviews from critics. A reviewer from Sify.com stated the film was \"typical overdose of Cheran melodrama masala\".<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/pandavar-bhoomi-review--pclulBgcjfigc.html</ref> Cheran then turned actor in director [[Thangar Bachan]]'s romantic drama film ''[[Solla Marandha Kadhai]]'' (2002). The film garnered mixed review but performed well at the box office.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/solla-marantha-kathai-review-tamil-pcluw5aeghgbd.html</ref>\n\n=== 2003\u20132006: ''Autograph'' and national recognition ===\nCheran first began work on ''Autograph'' in 2001 with [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]], though the actor later opted out as a result of schedule clashes.<ref>http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/lot/2330/may2001.html</ref> In early 2002, Cheran announced that he was going to instead make a film titled ''Pokkisham'' and [[Kanika (actress)|Kanika]] would star alongside him. However he failed to find a financier and moved back to making ''Autograph''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nilacharal.com/enter/cinebit/c97.html|title=Nilacharal&nbsp;\u2013 A Tamil entertainment ezine presenting interesting contents and useful services|publisher=}}</ref> As producers were unwilling to finance the film, Cheran opted to produce and star in the film himself and the film consequently took over a year to make. ''Autograph'' told the story of a man named Senthil, presented in four stages of his life&nbsp;\u2013 at school, college, work and during his marriage, and Cheran called the film \"semi-autobiographical\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">http://www.sify.com/movies/malayalam/interview.php?id=13429274&cid=2408</ref> The film starred him alongside [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]], [[Gopika]], [[Mallika (actress)|Mallika]] and Kanika, and had a popular soundtrack composed by [[Bharathwaj]]. Four different cinematographers worked on the film; [[Ravi Varman]] had shot the school episode in Senthil's early life with a 35&nbsp;mm lens, [[Vijay Milton]] shot the Kerala scenes, Dwaraknath shot the Chennai episode with a steady cam and Shanky Mahendran shot the \"'live' part\" of the film when the camera uses the [[Point of view shot|point of view]] of Senthil's character.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nMade at a budget of \u20b92 crore rupees, the film garnered over \u20b910 crores at the box office and became one of the most profitable Tamil films of the year. The film benefited from positive word-of-mouth and Cheran subsequently increased the number of prints from sixty five to eighty five for the second week, a rarity in Tamil cinema.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/year-2004-a-flashback/article28578111.ece</ref> The film won positive reviews from film critics, with [[Sify]].com writing that \"Cheran has used all his artists to perfection to make this love story with polish and panache\".<ref>http://www.sify.com/movies/autograph-review--pclv0vfgdgghh.html</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote it was a \"well-mounted production has too much familiar melodrama, and few real highlights (notably one delightful homage to \u201970s Tamil musicals), but remains an easy watch\".<ref>https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/autograph-2-1200531283/</ref> For the film, Cheran won a [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment|National Award for Best Popular Film]], along with two [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]] and two [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]], for Best Film and Best Director.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/cheran-and-awards-news-tamil-kkfvbgifchhsi.html</ref> The film became renowned as a \"cult classic\" and spawned several other inspirations and remakes in the Indian film industry.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#6</ref>\n\nCheran then restarted work ''Pokkisham'' in 2004 but postponed the film after falling out with the new lead actress [[Meera Jasmine]]. He then the drama film ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' (2005) focused on family relationships and Tamil culture, and cast himself in the lead role, alongside [[Rajkiran]], [[Saranya Ponvannan|Saranya]] and [[Padmapriya Janakiraman|Padmapriya]]. During production, the film went over budget and took nearly 145 days of shoot in Karaikudi, Madurai and Chennai. The film was made at a budget of \u20b92 crore rupees, and went on to make profits for the producers.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/tamil/interview.php?id=14045327&cid=2408</ref> The film also won positive reviews, with a critic from Sify.com noting that \"Cheran has kept the flag of uncompromised cinema flying and is one of the handful of directors, whose calling card remain his artistry over the medium\", adding that the film is \"brilliant and appeals as much to the mind as the heart\".<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/thavamai-thavamirundhu-review-tamil-pclvObfhagcjb.html</ref> Upon release, the film won several awards including the [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare|another National Award]] for best film on family welfare.<ref>http://dff.nic.in/2011/53rd_nff_2006.pdf</ref>\n\n=== 2007\u20132013: Focus on acting assignments ===\nHe restarted work on ''Pokkisham'' for the third time in December 2005, after completing ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' (2005), and approached [[Sandhya (actress)|Sandhya]] to play the lead role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid%3D389 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422133146/http://tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid=389 |archivedate=22 April 2016  }}</ref> The film did not take off so he moved on to make ''[[Maya Kannadi]]'' (2007) starring himself and [[Navya Nair]] in the lead roles. ''Mayakannadi'' was based on the concept of middle class dreams turning sour due to lack of commitment and created attention prior to release owing to Cheran's recent success. However, the film fared poorly at the box office and lost money for distributors.<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news/may-07-01/03-05-07-maayakannadi.html</ref> It received mixed reviews and a critic noted \"after seeing the film, we hope that the director applies this message in his life by sticking to his core strength of direction rather than dabble in roles that just do not suit him\".<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-cherans-treasures/20090813.htm#8</ref> Another reviewer from Rediff.com stated it was a \"brave, real film\" and that \"Cheran has done a superb job directing as well as acting\".<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/apr/16ssmaya.htm</ref> After the film's release, Cheran suggested that he regretted not thinking about letting someone else play the lead role instead of himself.<ref>https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:BijMP9VxalAJ:https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cheran-on-directing-thirumanam/article26365860.ece+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk</ref>\n\nCheran subsequently chose to prioritise acting commitments in order to raise finances for his subsequent film. He starred in [[T. V. Chandran]]'s award-winning ''[[Aadum Koothu]]'' (2008), [[Karu Pazhaniappan]]'s ''[[Pirivom Santhippom]]'' (2008) and ''[[Raman Thediya Seethai (2008 film)|Raman Thediya Seethai]]'' (2009). In his films, he often portrayed meek and mellow roles as a family-orientated man. The films all performed well commercially, and won good reviews for Cheran as an actor.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/19ssr.htm</ref><ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-reviews/reviews-2/raman-thediya-seethai-review.html</ref> For the fourth time, Cheran finally moved on to make ''Pokkisham'' (2009) and cast [[Padmapriya Janakiraman|Padmapriya]] alongside himself in the lead role during 2008. Set in the 1970s, the story revolved around two lovers&nbsp;\u2013 a Muslim Tamil literature student and a Hindu marine engineer working in Calcutta. ''Pokkisham'' opened to mixed reviews from critics, with many reviewers calling the screenplay too slow. The film subsequently fared poorly at the box office.<ref>http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/aug/21/slide-show-1-south-cheran-on-pokkisham.htm#1</ref>\n\nFollowing the commercial failure of ''Pokkisham'', Cheran actively chose to prioritise acting commitments. He appeared in [[Mysskin]]'s thriller ''[[Yuddham Sei]]'' as a detective agent, and in Rajan Madhav's mystery drama ''[[Muran (film)|Muran]]'' during 2011. In 2013, he featured in [[Vasanth]]'s ''[[Moondru Per Moondru Kaadhal]]'' and in the anthology film ''[[Chennaiyil Oru Naal]]''. In general, all four films won positive reviews from critics and performed well commercially.<ref>https://www.rediff.com/movies/report/south-review-yuddham-sei/20110204.htm</ref><ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/thriller-yudham-sei-is-value-for-money-tamil-movie-review-news-national-lcgtEfadiifsi.html</ref><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chen-cinema/life-comes-full-circle/article4636636.ece</ref>\n\n=== 2014\u2014present: Career decline ===\nFollowing successive failures as a director, Cheran had trouble attracting producers for his next directorial projects. He also revealed his intentions of making bigger budget films to cater to modern audiences and expressed that village-based films would be difficult, as the setting had changed considerably since the start of his career. He subsequently launched a film titled ''[[JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai]]'' in 2013 starring [[Sharwanand]] and [[Nithya Menen]] in the lead roles. However, the film languished in development hell and later had a straight-to-DVD release via Cheran's C2H platform.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/jk-ennum-nanbanin-vazhkai-review-tamil-pdhs4giheeghd.html</ref><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/audio-beat-jk-ennum-nanbanin-vazhkai-a-slice-of-life/article5228673.ece</ref> The period marked a difficult stage for the director, with the lack of directing and acting offers, complemented by family trouble, financial problems owing to C2H, and negative press for controversial statements.<ref name=\"deccanchronicle.com\">https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/270816/director-cheran-hit-by-diaspora.html</ref>\n\nAfter an extended break, Cheran made a return to direction with the family drama ''[[Thirumanam (2019 film)|Thirumanam]]'' (2019) starring himself alongside [[Sukanya (actress)|Sukanya]], Umapathi Ramaiah and Kavya Shetty. The film focused on marriage between young people, and Cheran suggested that the film would urge the youth to consider some of the societal factors before entering into wedlock.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\">https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cheran-on-directing-thirumanam/article26365860.ece</ref> The film opened to negative reviews, and fared poorly at the box office. A critic noted \"the basic problem with ''Thirumanam'' is the preachy tone of the film\" and that \"Cheran uses lengthy dialogues and songs to convey his thoughts, which often tests our patience\", concluding that the film \"is certainly not for audiences who like modern dramas\".<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/thirumanam-review-preachy-and-tiresome-review-tamil-tdbjC2hijaaif.html</ref><ref>https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/thirumanam-movie-review-rating-cheran-5606816/</ref><ref>https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/after-underwhelming-performance-cheran-s-thirumanam-to-re-release-1490161-2019-03-30</ref>\n\n== Other ventures ==\n=== Cinema2Home ===\nIn 2014, Cheran founded a new cinema distribution platform known as \"C2H\" (Cinema2Home) in an attempt to curb out copyright infringement in the Tamil film industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/cherans-idea-to-bring-the-movies-home/article6204850.ece|title=Cheran\u2019s idea to bring the movies home|date=13 July 2014|publisher=|via=The Hindu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/C2H-set-to-invade-your-drawing-room/articleshow/45942037.cms|title=C2H set to invade your drawing room&nbsp;\u2013 Times of India|publisher=}}</ref> He also launched his own music company 'Dream Sounds' in 2013, which released the soundtrack album of ''[[JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai]]'' (2015) and ''[[Thirumanam]]'' (2019). C2H was expected to deliver official original DVDs on the day of a film's theatrical release to homes, for which C2H signed an agreement with DVD maker [[Moser Baer]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/in-a-first-same-day-release-in-theatres-and-on-dvd/article6742514.ece|title=In a first, same day release in theatres and on DVD|first=R.|last=Ravikumar|date=31 December 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Around 150 distributors and 3000 dealers were said to be involved in the process of bringing the DVDs to households across Tamil Nadu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Cheran-Alleges-Threats-to-C2H-Dealers/2015/01/02/article2599660.ece|title=Cheran Alleges Threats to C2H Dealers|publisher=}}</ref> He had chosen to launch the platform after his film ''JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai'' failed to attract distributors for a theatrical release and intended on it becoming the first film of the platform. He later convinced producers who were struggling to find distributors to also put their films forward for a C2H release. Other films which joined included Thangasamy's ''[[Ettuthikkum Madhayaanai]]'', [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]]'s ''[[Appavin Meesai]]'', Parthi Bhaskar's ''[[Arjunan Kadhali]]'', Sashidharan's ''[[Vaaraayo Vennilaave]]'', Mahesh Periyasamy's ''Hockey'' and Balan's ''Koditta Idangalai Nirappuga''. Films such as Kandeepan's ''[[Aavi Kumar]]'' were briefly attached to C2H before opting out.<ref>http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2015/jan/20/Now-Watch-the-Release-of-Tamil-Films-from-Your-Home-707367.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, Cheran released his own film ''JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai'' through the platform and opted against giving the film a theatrical release.<ref name=\"auto\" /><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cheran-launches-c2h-with-his-movies-release/article6968179.ece</ref> The C2H initiative was later dropped as the platform did not garner support, and the remainder of the films except ''Ettuthikkum Madhayaanai'' remain unreleased.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/were-still-making-films-on-caste-shows-that-society-remains-the-same-cheran/articleshow/67806811.cms</ref><ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/> An arrest warrant was issued by a court against Cheran and his daughter Nivedha, after he did not respond to a bounced cheque following the failure of the venture in March 2016.<ref>https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/arrest-warrant-against-director-cheran-cheque-bounce-case-40146</ref><ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Cheran-daughter-appear-in-court/article16071659.ece</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nCheran shared his life experiences and was published as a serial article in the Tamil Weekly Magazine [[Ananda Vikatan]]. Later, it was published as a book titled ''Touring Talkies'', {{ISBN|81-89780-18-2}}. He later turned publisher with the Tamil novel ''Porum Valiyum'' (War & Pain), a novel on an emotional account of a war-torn Sri Lanka by author Savitri Advithanandhan. As a first step, he launched the publishing house \"Cheran Noolagam\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kollytalk.com/cinenews/cheran-launches-publishing-house-cheran-noolagam-79266.html|title=Cheran launches publishing house Cheran Noolagam&nbsp;\u2013 KOLLY TALK|first=|last=admin|date=18 January 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Bigg Boss ===\nIn 2019, Cheran entered the ''[[Bigg Boss Tamil 3|third season]]'' of the popular reality show ''[[Bigg Boss Tamil]]''. He got evicted after 90 days. He also received the \"Most Disciplined\" housemate award from Kamal Hasan.\n\n== Controversies ==\nCheran has often had a difficult relationship with producers and has made controversial statements, which have elicited discussion. In 2008, during the audio release of ''Raman Thediya Seethai'', he made a derogatory statement against press for writing rumours about him.<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/july-08-05/cheran-31-07-08.html</ref><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Cheran-lashes-at-media-apologises/articleshow/3306694.cms</ref> In 2013, he held a press conference asking parents to strictly oppose love marriages, despite having written many love stories in films. The conversation arose when he appealed to the media for assistance after his daughter had briefly run away from home with her boyfriend.<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cherans-daughter-says-she-wants-to-live-with-boyfriends-mother/article4993038.ece</ref>\n\nIn late 2015, prior to the [[Nadigar Sangam]] elections, Cheran publicly criticised the leadership potential and acting ability of actors [[Vishal (actor)|Vishal]] and [[Karthi]].<ref>https://silverscreen.in/news/cheran-justifies-pre-election-criticism-of-vishal-and-karthi/</ref> Cheran criticised actor [[Sharwanand]] in July 2016 for not cooperating with the promotion of ''Rajathi Raja'', the Telugu version of ''[[JK Enum Nanbanin Vaazhkai]]'' (2016). In return, Sharwanand stated that Cheran was in the wrong, was sour because of the failure of the Tamil film and had failed to pay him his salary.<ref>https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/tollywood/050716/silly-row-over-rajadhi-raja.html</ref> In 2016, Cheran blamed Sri Lankan Tamils for being the cause of video piracy in the Tamil film industry and expressed his regret for his support of their political independence movement. His remarks were met with outrage from the Tamil diaspora.<ref name=\"deccanchronicle.com\"/>\n\nIn March 2017, Cheran launched another scathing attack against Vishal and produced a seven-page letter accusing the actor of being \"selfish, power hungry and insensitive\". In his letter, Cheran also criticised Vishal for not lending him support during the failed C2H venture. Vishal later suggested that he respected but felt pity for Cheran for his false allegations.<ref>https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/i-respect-him-but-his-claims-make-me-pity-him-vishal-responds-to-cherans-allegations-4969208/</ref><ref>https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/vishal-selfish-power-hungry-and-insensitive-director-cheran-lashes-out-58541</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nCheran is married to Selvarani and has two daughters, Nivedha Priyadarshini and Damini.<ref>https://www.sify.com/movies/cheran-meets-media-breaks-down-news-tamil-nifkrCdjjihsi.html</ref><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Im-heartbroken-Cheran/articleshow/21649964.cms</ref><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Family-drama-ends-daughter-agrees-to-go-with-Cheran/articleshow/21968492.cms</ref><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/I-want-Damini-to-take-some-time-for-herself-Cheran/articleshow/22118558.cms</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n;Films\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Title\n! rowspan=2 | Role\n! colspan=4 | Credited as\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n! width=65 | Director\n! width=65 | Actor\n! width=65 | Writer\n! width=65 | Producer\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|1997 ||''[[Bharathi Kannamma]]'' ||  ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||   || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || ||\n|-\n| ''[[Porkkaalam]]'' || Still photographer || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|  ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || ||\n|-\n| 1998 || ''[[Desiya Geetham]]'' ||  ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||   || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || ||\n|-\n| 2000 || ''[[Vetri Kodi Kattu]]'' ||  ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||   || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || ||\n|-\n| 2001 || ''[[Pandavar Bhoomi]]'' ||  ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||   || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || ||\n|-\n| 2002 || ''[[Solla Marandha Kadhai]]'' || Sivadhanu ||   ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}}||  || ||\n|-\n| 2004 ||  ''[[Autograph (2004 film)|Autograph]]''|| Senthil || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Thavamai Thavamirundhu]]'' || Ramalingam Muthaiah || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || ||\n|-\n| 2006 || ''[[Azhagai Irukkirai Bayamai Irukkirathu]]'' ||  ||   ||   ||   || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2007 || ''[[Maya Kannadi]]'' || Kumar || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || ||\n|-\n| ''[[Aadum Koothu]]'' || Gnanasekaran ||   ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||  || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2008 || ''[[Pirivom Santhippom]]'' || Nadesan ||   ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||  || ||\n|-\n| ''[[Raman Thediya Seethai (2008 film)|Raman Thediya Seethai]]'' || Venugopal ||   || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||  || ||\n|-\n||2009 || ''[[Pokkisham]]'' || Lenin || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} || style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{y}} ||  ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2011 || ''[[Yuddham Sei]]'' || J.

They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply [[maple]] [[plywood]] deck with a [[Varnish#Polyurethane|polyurethane coating]] for smoothness and durability and wheels attached to the underside.\n\nThe skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot with other foot balanced on the board, or by [[Pump (skateboarding)|pumping]] one's legs in structures such as a bowl or [[half pipe]]. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|goofy]];\" if the rider's leading foot is their left foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|regular]].\" If the rider is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy, they are said to be riding in \"[[Footedness#Switch,_Fakie_and_Nollie|switch]],\" and vice versa. A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred to as riding \"mongo\", and has negative connotations of style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community.\n\nIn the early 2000s, [[electric skateboard]]s have also appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. \n\nThere is no governing body that declares any regulations on what constitutes a skateboard or the parts from which it is assembled. Historically, the skateboard has conformed both to contemporary trends and to the ever-evolving array of stunts performed by riders/users, who require a certain functionality from the board. The board shape depends largely upon its desired function. [[Longboard (skateboard)|Longboards]] are a type of skateboard with a longer [[wheelbase]] and larger, softer wheels. \n\nThe two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |title=Skateboards: Fit & Types |publisher=LiveStrong |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014011932/http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing,  while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Skateboarding}}\nSkateboarding started in California in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |title=Skateboarding: From Wooden Box Boards to Commercial Mainstream |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414144506/https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |archive-date=April 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first skateboards were made from [[roller skates]] (attached to a board).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |title=Scholastic News: Skateboarding|website=teacher.scholastic.com |access-date=March 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403111056/http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |archive-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Skateboarding gained in popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially referred to as \"sidewalk surfing\". Initially, skateboards were handmade from wooden boxes and planks by individuals. Companies started manufacturing skateboards in 1959, as the sport became more popular.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27\u201377 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> In postwar America, society was carefree with children commonly playing in the streets.<ref>{{Citation |title=The mix of sunshine and rebellion is really intoxicating|work=Skate Life|pages=27\u201377 |publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472900459|doi=10.2307/j.ctv65sw5s.5|year=2010}}</ref> Boards were also continuing to evolve as companies tried to make them lighter, stronger and improve their performance.\n\nSkateboarding is a very individual activity. Skateboarding still hasn't stopped evolving, and skaters are coming up with new tricks all the time. Since 2000, due to attention in the media and products like skateboarding video games, children's skateboards and commercialization, skateboarding has been pulled into the mainstream. As more interest and money has been invested into skateboarding, more skate parks, and better skateboards have become available. In addition, the continuing interest has motivated skateboarding companies have to keep innovating and inventing new things.

A traditional complete skateboard consists of the deck (often with griptape applied on top to enhance traction), trucks (with urethane bushings), wheels (with sealed bearings), bushings, nuts and bolts to fasten the truck and wheel assembly to the bottom of the deck. Older decks also included plastic parts such as side, tail, and nose guards.\n\n===Deck===\n[[Image:Skateboard.JPG|thumb|The side of a skateboard]] Modern decks vary in size, but most are {{convert|7|to|10.5|in|cm}} wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when skateboarding. Standard skateboard decks are usually between {{convert|28|and|33|in|cm}} long. The underside of the deck can be printed with a design by the manufacturer, blank, or decorated by any other means.\n\n\"Long\" boards are usually over {{convert|36|in|cm}} long.

Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |title= SKATEBOARDS |accessdate= August 30, 2017|date= June 15, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010205/http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |archive-date= August 30, 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Grip tape===\nGrip tape is a sheet of paper or fabric with adhesive on one side and a surface similar to fine sandpaper on the other. Rubber grip tape is also available, which has gathered some popularity due to the lack of damage it causes to skate shoes. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's feet to grip the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes. \n\n===Trucks===\n[[File:Skateboard-truck.jpg|thumb|An [[Independent Truck Company|Independent]] brand skateboard truck]] \nAttached to the deck are two metal (usually made of [[aluminum alloy]]) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts.\n\nThe top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the ''baseplate'', and beneath it is the ''hanger''. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are ''[[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]]'', also ''rubbers'' or ''[[grommet]]s'', that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The ''bushings'' cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as [[durometer]]s, which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a ''[[Kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]]'' holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be loosened for increased turning or tightened for more stability. The standard kingpin nut size is {{frac|3|8}} - [[Threads per inch|24]] [[Unified Thread Standard#Designation|UNF]].\nThe position of the hanger with respect to the baseplate is determined by the ''pivot'', a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a ''pivot cup'', a plastic part that takes most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assists in centering. The pivot cup should be periodically lubricated to ensure a smooth turn.\n\nIn general, an axle width should be chosen that is close to the width of the deck it will be used with.<ref>Has a guide to choosing the right size trucks for a skateboard deck http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426135324/http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck |date=April 26, 2010 }}</ref> For example, a {{convert|7.75|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between {{convert|7.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.0|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is {{frac|5|16}} - 24 UNF, and the thinner \"jam\" style with an optional nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels to get in the way when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small reduce stability and can cause wheel bite to occur more easily when turning.\n\nLongboard-specific trucks are a recent development. A longboard truck has the kingpin laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees<ref>Contains a list of dimensions for popular longboard truck manufacturer {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>) to the deck, giving a greater degree of turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard-specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.\n\n===Wheels===\nThe [[wheel]]s of a skateboard are usually made of [[polyurethane]], and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters ({{convert|55\u201385|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters ({{convert|48\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}) keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the [[Shore durometer]] \"A\" scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the \"B\" or \"D\" scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness. Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually {{convert|51\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make [[Skateboarding trick|tricks]] like [[kickflip]]s and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). [[Vertical ramp]] or \"vert\" skating requires larger wheels (usually {{convert|55\u201365|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels ({{convert|60\u201375|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from {{convert|60 to 100|mm|in|2|abbr=in}}. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as they minimize noise and roll smoothly over most types of terrain.\n\n===Bearings===\n[[File:BallBearing.gif|thumb|An animation of the working principle for a [[ball bearing]]. ''N.B. The diagram shows an 8-balled-bearing whereas a skateboard bearing is typically 7-balled'']]\n\nEach skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two [[ball bearing]]s. With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard \"608\" size, with a bore of {{convert|8|mm|in|3|abbr=in}} (or {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}} depending on the axle), an outer diameter of {{convert|22|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}, and a width of {{convert|7|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}. These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used. Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the [[ABEC scale]]. The starts with ABEC1 as the lowest, followed by 3, 5, 7, and 9. It is a common misconception that the higher ABECs are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are. Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance/ |title=Lubrication |access-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529023018/http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance |archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bearings that are kept unmaintained have their performance greatly lowered and will soon need to be replaced. Bearing cleaning kits are commonly available on the market. The ABEC rating does not determine the speed or durability of a skateboard bearing. In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as [[Bones Bearings]], which makes bearings specifically for skateboarding, often marketed as \"Skate Rated\". Each bearing usually contains 7 steel or ceramic [[Ball (bearing)|bearing balls]], although other configurations are used as well.\n\n===Hardware===\nMounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an [[Allen wrench|Allen]] or [[Phillips (screw head)|Phillips]] head, and matching nylon [[locknut]]s. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.\n\nUhh==Optional components==\n\nUhh==Optional components==\n\n===Risers/wedges===\nRisers increase the space between the truck and the deck. This allows the truck to twist further without causing wheel bite (when the wheel touches the deck and stops rotating).\nWedges can be used to change the [[steering|turning]] characteristics of a truck.<ref>A guide describing turning characteristics of different Riser/Wedge types {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Shock Pads===\nShock pads are made of polyurethane and rubber.

They are usually made of a specially designed 7-ply [[maple]] [[plywood]] deck with a [[Varnish#Polyurethane|polyurethane coating]] for smoothness and durability and wheels attached to the underside.\n\nThe skateboarder moves by pushing with one foot with other foot balanced on the board, or by [[Pump (skateboarding)|pumping]] one's legs in structures such as a bowl or [[half pipe]]. A skateboard can also be used by simply standing on the deck while on a downward slope and allowing gravity to propel the board and rider. If the rider's leading foot is their right foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|goofy]];\" if the rider's leading foot is their left foot, they are said to ride \"[[Footedness#Goofy_stance_vs._Regular_stance|regular]].\" If the rider is normally regular but chooses to ride goofy, they are said to be riding in \"[[Footedness#Switch,_Fakie_and_Nollie|switch]],\" and vice versa. A skater is typically more comfortable pushing with their back foot; choosing to push with the front foot is commonly referred to as riding \"mongo\", and has negative connotations of style and effectiveness in the skateboarding community.\n\nIn the early 2000s, [[electric skateboard]]s have also appeared. These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery. \n\nThere is no governing body that declares any regulations on what constitutes a skateboard or the parts from which it is assembled. Historically, the skateboard has conformed both to contemporary trends and to the ever-evolving array of stunts performed by riders/users, who require a certain functionality from the board. The board shape depends largely upon its desired function. [[Longboard (skateboard)|Longboards]] are a type of skateboard with a longer [[wheelbase]] and larger, softer wheels. \n\nThe two main types of skateboards are the longboard and the shortboard. The shape of the board is also important: the skateboard must be concaved to perform tricks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |title=Skateboards: Fit & Types |publisher=LiveStrong |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014011932/http://www.livestrong.com/article/339215-skateboards-fit-types/ |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Longboards are usually faster and are mostly used for cruising and racing,  while shortboards are mostly used for doing tricks and riding in skateparks.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Skateboarding}}\nSkateboarding started in California in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |title=Skateboarding: From Wooden Box Boards to Commercial Mainstream |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414144506/https://www.thoughtco.com/brief-history-of-skateboarding-3002042 |archive-date=April 14, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first skateboards were made from [[roller skates]] (attached to a board).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |title=Scholastic News: Skateboarding|website=teacher.scholastic.com |access-date=March 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403111056/http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/Skateboarding/articles/index.asp?article=history&topic=0 |archive-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Skateboarding gained in popularity because of surfing: in fact, skateboarding was initially referred to as \"sidewalk surfing\".

Variants of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |title= SKATEBOARDS |accessdate= August 30, 2017|date= June 15, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010205/http://skatesradar.com/skateboard/ |archive-date= August 30, 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Grip tape===\nGrip tape is a sheet of paper or fabric with adhesive on one side and a surface similar to fine sandpaper on the other. Rubber grip tape is also available, which has gathered some popularity due to the lack of damage it causes to skate shoes. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's feet to grip the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes. \n\n===Trucks===\n[[File:Skateboard-truck.jpg|thumb|An [[Independent Truck Company|Independent]] brand skateboard truck]] \nAttached to the deck are two metal (usually made of [[aluminum alloy]]) trucks, which connect the wheels and bearings to the deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts.\n\nThe top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the ''baseplate'', and beneath it is the ''hanger''. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are ''[[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]]'', also ''rubbers'' or ''[[grommet]]s'', that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The ''bushings'' cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as [[durometer]]s, which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a ''[[Kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]]'' holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be loosened for increased turning or tightened for more stability. The standard kingpin nut size is {{frac|3|8}} - [[Threads per inch|24]] [[Unified Thread Standard#Designation|UNF]].\nThe position of the hanger with respect to the baseplate is determined by the ''pivot'', a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a ''pivot cup'', a plastic part that takes most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assists in centering. The pivot cup should be periodically lubricated to ensure a smooth turn.\n\nIn general, an axle width should be chosen that is close to the width of the deck it will be used with.<ref>Has a guide to choosing the right size trucks for a skateboard deck http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426135324/http://skate-parts.com/blog/choosing-right-size-trucks-your-skateboard-deck |date=April 26, 2010 }}</ref> For example, a {{convert|7.75|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide deck will usually be fitted with trucks that have axles between {{convert|7.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.0|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is {{frac|5|16}} - 24 UNF, and the thinner \"jam\" style with an optional nylon lock.) Trucks that are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels to get in the way when the skateboard is being ridden. Trucks that are too small reduce stability and can cause wheel bite to occur more easily when turning.\n\nLongboard-specific trucks are a recent development. A longboard truck has the kingpin laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees<ref>Contains a list of dimensions for popular longboard truck manufacturer {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>) to the deck, giving a greater degree of turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard-specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.\n\n===Wheels===\nThe [[wheel]]s of a skateboard are usually made of [[polyurethane]], and come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger diameters ({{convert|55\u201385|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) roll faster, and move more easily over cracks in pavement and are better for transition skateboarding. Smaller diameters ({{convert|48\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}) keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity which allows for a better response time, but also make for a slower top speed and are better for street skateboarding. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the [[Shore durometer]] \"A\" scale. Again like car tires, wheels range from the very soft (about Shore A 75) to the very hard (about Shore A 101). As the A scale stops at 100, any wheels labeled 101A or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the \"B\" or \"D\" scales, which have a larger and more accurate range of hardness. Modern street skaters prefer medium-sized wheels (usually {{convert|51\u201354|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as small wheels with lighter trucks can make [[Skateboarding trick|tricks]] like [[kickflip]]s and other flip tricks easier by keeping the center of gravity of the skateboard closer to the deck, thus making the deck easier to spin. Street wheels are harder (A 100/A 101). [[Vertical ramp]] or \"vert\" skating requires larger wheels (usually {{convert|55\u201365|mm|in|abbr=in|2|disp=or}}), as it involves higher speeds. Vert wheels are also usually slightly softer (A 98/ A 99), allowing them to maintain high speed on ramps without sliding. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels ({{convert|60\u201375|mm|in|2|abbr=in|disp=or}}) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from {{convert|60 to 100|mm|in|2|abbr=in}}. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard videographers as well, as they minimize noise and roll smoothly over most types of terrain.\n\n===Bearings===\n[[File:BallBearing.gif|thumb|An animation of the working principle for a [[ball bearing]]. ''N.B. The diagram shows an 8-balled-bearing whereas a skateboard bearing is typically 7-balled'']]\n\nEach skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two [[ball bearing]]s. With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard \"608\" size, with a bore of {{convert|8|mm|in|3|abbr=in}} (or {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}} depending on the axle), an outer diameter of {{convert|22|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}, and a width of {{convert|7|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}. These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used. Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the [[ABEC scale]]. The starts with ABEC1 as the lowest, followed by 3, 5, 7, and 9. It is a common misconception that the higher ABECs are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. Bearing performance is determined by how well maintained the bearings are. Maintenance on bearings includes periodically cleaning and lubricating them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance/ |title=Lubrication |access-date=June 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529023018/http://bonesbearings.com/support/maintenance |archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bearings that are kept unmaintained have their performance greatly lowered and will soon need to be replaced. Bearing cleaning kits are commonly available on the market. The ABEC rating does not determine the speed or durability of a skateboard bearing. In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as [[Bones Bearings]], which makes bearings specifically for skateboarding, often marketed as \"Skate Rated\". Each bearing usually contains 7 steel or ceramic [[Ball (bearing)|bearing balls]], although other configurations are used as well.\n\n===Hardware===\nMounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an [[Allen wrench|Allen]] or [[Phillips (screw head)|Phillips]] head, and matching nylon [[locknut]]s. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of risers) to the board. Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.\n\n==Optional components==\n\n===Risers/wedges===\nRisers increase the space between the truck and the deck. This allows the truck to twist further without causing wheel bite (when the wheel touches the deck and stops rotating).\nWedges can be used to change the [[steering|turning]] characteristics of a truck.<ref>A guide describing turning characteristics of different Riser/Wedge types {{cite web |url=http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405063723/http://www.randal.com/guides_faq.html |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Shock Pads===\nShock pads are made of polyurethane and rubber. They are very similar to risers but vary in the fact that their sole purpose is to cushion the board from the trucks. Since the trucks are metal and the board wood, whenever the board hits the ground after doing a trick, the energy goes through the truck to the board\u200a\u2500\u200athis has caused boards to crack, split, or even break in half, and shock pads were created to prevent this.\n\n===Rails/ribs===\nRails (or ribs), are narrow strips of plastic or metal that are attached under the deck lengthwise along the edges. They are used for additional grip for grabs, and to enhance sliding while protecting the deck's graphics at the same time. Rails also provide a more consistent feel for slides, as the slide of a regular skateboard will suffer from the wear of the paint or varnish on the bottom of the board. Although rarely used anymore, they are useful for experienced skaters that are capable of grabs.\n\n===Sliptape===\nSliptape is a clear piece of self-adhesive plastic that sticks to the underside of a deck. It helps protect the board's graphics and allows the board to slide more easily. Another name for this is everslick.\n\n===Lapper===\nA lapper is a plastic cover that is fastened to the rear truck and serves to protect the kingpin when grinding. It also prevents hang-ups by providing a smoother transition for the truck when it hits an obstacle or a metal pipe or round bar.\n\n===Nose guard===\nA nose guard is a plastic bumper used to protect the front of a skateboard which was once popular but is now only commonly seen on older board models.\n\n===Tail guard (a.k.a. skid plate)===\nBolted onto the underside of the tail end of a skateboard, the tail guard (also known as a \"skid plate\") protected the tail end from skid stops and other maneuvers that would otherwise wear away the wood (commonly known as razor tail) and decrease the longevity of the tail. Typically made of plastic, these were widely popular in the '80s but their usage quickly diminished with the arrival of two-tail board designs, which became increasingly popular in the 1990s.\n\n===Tail Devil===\nA \"tail devil\" is a sparking device made of flint which is placed either on the tail or nose of the skateboard (or both) to create a sparking effect mainly visible after dark when the tail or nose of the boards scrapes against the ground.\n\n===Copers===\nPlastic half tubing that protected the axles of the trucks. In the 1980\u201385 period, shopping cart handles were cut by some to fit as a makeshift coper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Sublimated graphic===\n[[Sublimation (phase transition)]] is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram. In this case, ink is transferred to a base layer, fibreglass for example, through heat and pressure, the result is a full color graphic that will not come off as easily as the more common heat transfers. This application is often found with bamboo boards and composite construction longboards where fibreglass can allow for various degrees of flex or stiffness depending on the ride you're looking for, cruising and carving versus slalom and downhill.\n\n===Skateboard Multi-tool===\nWhile not part of a skateboard, an all in one skateboard tool capable of mounting and removing trucks & wheels and adjusting truck kingpins are commonly sold by [[skate shop]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fasttech.com/products/1921/10062128/9696858-multifunctional-t-type-roller-hex-socket-wrench |title=Multifunctional T-Type Roller Hex Socket Wrench Skateboard Repair Tool |publisher=fasttech.com |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref> Some tools include a metal [[Skateboard#Grip_tape|grip-tape]] [[File_(tool)|file]] and can also be used as a [[bottle-opener]].

He was educated at [[Arrow Vale High School]] from 1995 to 1998. He joined Manchester United as a trainee in July 1999 and turned professional at the end of the following month. In January 2001, he was sent on loan to [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] for four months where he only played in four games, all as a substitute. He made his only first-team appearance for United in the [[Football League Cup|Worthington Cup]] Third Round defeat against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] on 5 November 2001. United lost this game 4\u20130.\n\nDavis was loaned to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon]] for three months in the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season, making 15 appearances for the [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] side, scoring three goals, although it was not enough to bring anything better than a mid-table finish for [[Andy King (footballer born 1956)|Andy King's]] side. Davis was keen on accepting an offer to extend his deal, but United manager [[Alex Ferguson]] recalled him. His last game for Swindon Town was on 9 November 2002. After returning to Old Trafford, he was on the bench for United's [[UEFA Champions League]] tie away to [[Deportivo La Coruna]] just before the end of 2001\u201302. He then joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on a season's loan in August 2003.\n\n==International career==\n===Under-16===\nDavis represented [[England national under-16 football team|England]] at [[1999 UEFA European Under-16 Championship]].

He was educated at [[Arrow Vale High School]] from 1995 to 1998. He joined Manchester United as a trainee in July 1999 and turned professional at the end of the following month. In January 2001, he was sent on loan to [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] for four months where he only played in four games, all as a substitute. He made his only first-team appearance for United in the [[Football League Cup|Worthington Cup]] Third Round defeat against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] on 5 November 2001. United lost this game 4\u20130.\n\nDavis was loaned to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon]] for three months in the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season, making 15 appearances for the [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] side, scoring three goals, although it was not enough to bring anything better than a mid-table finish for [[Andy King (footballer born 1956)|Andy King's]] side. Davis was keen on accepting an offer to extend his deal, but United manager [[Alex Ferguson]] recalled him. His last game for Swindon Town was on 9 November 2002. After returning to Old Trafford, he was on the bench for United's [[UEFA Champions League]] tie away to [[Deportivo La Coruna]] just before the end of 2001\u201302.

Religious Islamic art has been typically characterized by the absence of figures and extensive use of [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]], [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|abstract floral]] patterns. However, representations of Islamic religious figures are found in some manuscripts from [[Persianate society|Persianate cultures]], including [[Ottoman Turkey]] and [[Mughal India]]. These pictures were meant to illustrate the story and not to infringe on the Islamic prohibition of idolatry, but many Muslims regard such images as forbidden.<ref name=esposito/> In secular art of the Muslim world, representations of human and animal forms historically flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures, although, partly because of opposing religious sentiments, figures in paintings were often stylized, giving rise to a variety of decorative figural designs.<ref name=met/>\n\n== Calligraphy ==\n{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}\n[[File:Courtyard of the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey 004.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Tiles with some calligraphy in the courtyard of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]] ([[Turkey]])]]\nCalligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]], religious exhortations, including Qur'anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings.

Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic ''[[kufic]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of [[minbar]]s, and metalwork.<ref name=\"JAACMadden\"/> Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures are sometimes referred to as ''quranic art''.<ref>Islamic Archaeology in the Sudan - Page 22, Intisar Soghayroun Elzein - 2004</ref>\n\nEast Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called \"epigraphic ware\", has been described as \"probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery\".<ref>Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278\u2013290</ref>  Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in [[relief]], or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings.  Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production.  The [[tughra]] or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones.  Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur'anic verses, or other texts.\n\nThe main languages, all using [[Arabic script]], are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], always used for Qur'anic verses, [[Farsi|Persian]] in the [[Persianate]] world, especially for poetry, and [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], with [[Urdu]] appearing in later centuries.  Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.\n\n== Painting ==\n[[File:Khamseh Nizami 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Scene from the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', Persian, 1539\u201343]]\n{{see also|Arabic miniature|Ottoman miniature|Persian miniature|Mughal miniature}}\n\nAlthough there has been a tradition of wall-paintings, especially in the [[Persianate]] world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, or later as a single page for inclusion in a ''[[muraqqa]]'' or bound album of miniatures and [[calligraphy]].  The tradition of the [[Persian miniature]] has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the [[Ottoman miniature]] of Turkey and the [[Mughal miniature]] in India. Miniatures were especially an art of the court, and because they were not seen in public, it has been argued that constraints on the depiction of the human figure were much more relaxed, and indeed miniatures often contain great numbers of small figures, and from the 16th century portraits of single ones.  Although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts, notably several of the [[Umayyad Desert Castles]] (c. 660-750), and during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749\u20131258).<ref>{{cite book|author1=J.

Portraits of rulers developed in the 16th century, and later in Persia, then becoming very popular. Mughal portraits, normally in profile, are very finely drawn in a realist style, while the best Ottoman ones are vigorously stylized.  Album miniatures typically featured picnic scenes, portraits of individuals or (in India especially) animals, or idealized youthful beauties of either sex.\n\nChinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky.  The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size.  The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear.  The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.\n\n== Rugs and carpets ==\n{{Main|Oriental rugs}}\n{{see also|Turkish carpet|Persian carpet|Kilim}}\n[[File:Farsh1.jpg|400px|thumb|left|From the yarn fiber to the colors, every part of the [[Persian rug]] is traditionally handmade from natural ingredients over the course of many months]]\nNo Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the ''Oriental carpet'' ([[oriental rug]]). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a [[prayer rug]], which would provide a clean place to pray).  They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the [[Netherlands]].  Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments.  In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.<ref>Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox.

Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.\n\nThere are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the [[Pitti Palace]] in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer.<ref>King and Sylvester, 27, 61\u201362, as \"The Medici Mamluk Carpet\"</ref>  Production of this style of carpet began under the [[Mamluks]] but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt.<ref>King and Sylvester, 59\u201366, 79\u201383</ref>  The other sophisticated tradition was the [[Persian carpet]] which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the [[Ardabil Carpet]] and [[Coronation Carpet]]; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition.  These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central ''[[Gul (design)|gul]]'' motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders.  The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today.  The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre.  Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear.\n\nAs well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans.  Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include [[coats of arms]], enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the [[Papal Palace, Avignon]], and the industry continued after the [[Reconquista]].<ref>King and Sylvester: Spanish carpets: 11\u201312, 50\u201352; Balkans: 77 and ''passim''</ref>  [[Armenian carpet]]-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought.  The [[Berber carpet]]s of North Africa have a distinct design tradition.  Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs.  As well as pile carpets, [[kelim]]s and other types of flat-weave or [[embroidered]] textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls.   Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Great mosque of damascus 709-15 AD, syria, easter 2004 - 1463689043.jpg|thumb|Great Mosque of Damascus, 709-715 AD, Syria, constructed by the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I]]\n{{Main|Islamic architecture}}\n\n=== Columns ===\nEarly Islamic columns followed the style seen in the classic period of the Mediterranean.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/|title=Columns in Islamic Architecture|last=Graves|first=Margaret|date=2 June 2009|website=|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Classic columns can be seen in earlier mosques such as the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba Mosque|C\u00f3rdoba]].

Early pottery is often unglazed, but [[Tin-glazing|tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]], originating from 9th century Iraq.<ref>Mason (1995), p. 5</ref> The first industrial complex for [[glass]] and [[pottery]] production was built in [[Raqqa]], [[Syria]], in the 8th century.<ref name=Henderson>{{Cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Henderson |first2=S.

Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected.  Until the [[Early Modern]] period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied.  An example of this is the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence.\n\n[[File:Animal Decorated Ottoman Pottery P1000585.JPG|thumb|[[Iznik pottery|Iznik glazed pottery]] ca. 1575]]\n\nThe [[Hispano-Moresque]] style emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] or Muslim Spain in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two [[ceramic]] techniques to [[Europe]]: [[ceramic glaze|glazing]] with an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] white [[tin-glazing|tin-glaze]], and [[Lusterware|painting in metallic lusters]].  Ottoman [[\u0130znik pottery]] produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics.  These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.<ref>Savage, 175, suggests that the Persians had made some experiments towards producing it, and the earliest European porcelain, [[Medici porcelain]], was made in the late 16th century, perhaps with a Persian or [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] assistant on the team.</ref>\n\nThe medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery. Examples are found throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Egypt]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |first=Eva |last=Baer |year=1983 |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=0-87395-602-8 |pages=58, 86, 143, 151, 176, 201, 226, 243, 292, 304}}</ref>\n\n===Tiling===\n{{further|Islamic geometric patterns|Tessellation}}\n\n[[File:HeratFridayMosque.jpg|thumb|left|Tiled exterior of the [[Friday Mosque of Herat]], [[Afghanistan]]]]\nThe earliest grand Islamic buildings, like the [[Dome of the Rock]], in [[Jerusalem]] had interior walls decorated with [[mosaic]]s in the Byzantine style, but without human figures.  From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured [[tile|tiling]] for interior and exterior walls and [[dome]]s developed.  Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns.  Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme \u2013 a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing.\n\nSome elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional [[relief]], and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures.  These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals.  The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs.  The geometric patterns, such as modern North African [[zellige]] work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as \"[[mosaic]]\", which is not strictly correct.\n\nThe Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) \"parchin kari\", a type of [[pietra dura]] decoration from inlaid panels of semi-precious stones, with jewels in some cases.  This can be seen at the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]] and other imperial commissions.  The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.\n\n== Glass ==\n{{main|Islamic glass}}\n[[File:Luckofedenhall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"The [[Luck of Edenhall]]\", a 13th-century Syrian beaker, in England since the Middle Ages]]\n\nFor most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in [[Eurasia]], exported to both Europe and China.  Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of [[Sassanian glass|Sassanian]] and [[Ancient Roman glass]], and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre-Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially  formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in [[Egypt]].  For this reason it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties.<ref>Arts, 131, 135. The Introduction (pp. 131\u2013135) is by [[Ralph Pinder-Wilson]], who shared the catalogue entries with [[Waffiya Essy]].</ref>  From various documentary references glassmaking and [[Ancient glass trade|glass trading]] seems to have been a speciality of the Jewish minority in several centres.<ref>Encyclopaedia Judaica, \"Glass\", [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07392.html Online version]</ref>\n\n[[File:Mosque lamp Met 91.1.1534.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mamluk]] [[mosque lamp]]]]\n\nBetween the 8th and early 11th centuries the emphasis in luxury glass is on effects achieved by \"manipulating the surface\" of the glass, initially by incising into the glass on a wheel, and later by cutting away the background to leave a design in relief.<ref>Arts, 131\u2013133</ref>  The very massive [[Hedwig glass]]es, only found in Europe, but normally considered Islamic (or possibly from Muslim craftsmen in [[Norman Sicily]]), are an example of this, though puzzlingly late in date.<ref>Arts, 131, 141</ref>  These and other glass pieces probably represented cheaper versions of vessels of carved [[rock crystal]] (clear [[quartz]]), themselves influenced by earlier glass vessels,<ref>Arts, 141</ref> and there is some evidence that at this period glass cutting and [[hardstone carving]] were regarded as the same craft.<ref>Endnote 111 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONUFZfcEkBgC&pg=RA1-PA88&dq=Islamic+glass+Jewish&hl=en&ei=CRdUTcrcFYHQhAepnb2vCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Islamic%20glass%20Jewish&f=false ''Roman glass: reflections on cultural change''], Fleming, Stuart. see also endnote 110 for Jewish glassworkers</ref>  From the 12th century the industry in Persia and [[Mesopotamia]] appears to decline, and the main production of luxury glass shifts to Egypt and Syria, and decorative effects of colour on smooth surfaced glass.<ref>Arts, 131, 133\u2013135</ref>  Throughout the period local centres made simpler wares such as [[Hebron glass]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].\n\nLustre painting, by techniques similar to [[lustreware]] in pottery, dates back to the 8th century in Egypt, and became widespread in the 12th century.  Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects.  [[Gilding|Gilded]], painted and [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork.  Some of the finest work was in [[mosque lamp]]s donated by a ruler or wealthy man.  As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it \"often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles\".<ref>Arts, 131\u2013135, 141\u2013146; quote, 134</ref>  [[Aleppo]] seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the [[Mongol invasion]] of 1260, and [[Timur]] appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to [[Samarkand]].  By about 1500 the [[Venice|Venetians]] were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.<ref>Arts, 134\u2013135</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Islamic brasswork}}\n\n== Metalwork ==\n[[File:Bassin Syrie 1.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the \"[[Baptist\u00e8re de Saint Louis]],\" c. 1300, a [[Mamluk]] basin of engraved brass with gold, silver and [[niello]] inlay]]\n\nMedieval Islamic metalwork offers a complete contrast to its European equivalent, which is dominated by modelled figures and brightly coloured decoration in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], some pieces entirely in precious metals.  In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in [[brass]], bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental, shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black [[niello]].  The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down.  The abundant local sources of [[zinc]] compared to [[tin]] explains the rarity of [[bronze]].  Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid.<ref name=Baer1983>{{cite book |last=Baer |first=Eva |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s__yi4pD-VEC |year=1983 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4 |pages=whole book}}</ref>\n\nThe use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s, as was the wearing of gold rings.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]</ref>  One thing Islamic metalworkers shared with European ones was high social status compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed.\n\nIslamic work includes some three-dimensional animal figures as fountainheads or [[aquamanile]]s, but only one significant enamelled object is known, using Byzantine [[cloisonne]] techniques.<ref>Arts, 201, and earlier pages for animal shapes.</ref>  The [[Pisa Griffin]] is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andaluz.  More common objects given elaborate decoration include massive low candlesticks and lamp-stands, lantern lights, bowls, dishes, basins, buckets (these probably for the bath),<ref>But see Arts, 170, where the standard view is disputed</ref> and [[ewer]]s, as well as caskets, pen-cases and plaques. Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, so are often lavishly treated display pieces.  A typical 13th century ewer from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] is decorated with foliage, animals and the [[Signs of the Zodiac]] in silver and copper, and carries a blessing.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.530 \"Base of a ewer with Zodiac medallions &#91;Iran&#93; (91.1.530)\"].

The inscription reads: ''\"Bi-l-yumn wa al-baraka\u2026\"'' meaning \"With bliss and divine grace\u2026\"</ref>  Specialized objects include knives, arms and armour (always of huge interest to the elite) and scientific instruments such as [[astrolabe]]s, as well as [[jewellery]].  Decoration is typically densely packed and very often includes arabesques and calligraphy, sometimes naming an owner and giving a date.<ref>Arts, 157\u2013160, and exhibits 161\u2013204</ref>\n\n== Other applied arts ==\n[[File:Dagger horse head Louvre OA7891.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dagger with hilt in [[jade]], gold, [[rubies]] and [[emerald]]s.  Blade of [[damascening|damascened]] steel inlaid with gold.]]\nHigh levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including [[hardstone carving]]s and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone.  Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur'an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters.  Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and [[lacquer]] over paint.<ref>See the relevant sections in \"Arts\"</ref>\n\n===Precious stones===\n\nEgyptian carving of [[rock crystal]] into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040.  There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the [[Cairo]] palace of the [[Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries.<ref>[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]</ref> From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels.  Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.<ref>Arts, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\n===House and furniture===\n[[File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman [[marquetry]] and tile-top table, about 1560]]\nOlder wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes.  An important exception are the complex [[muqarnas]] and [[moc\u00e1rabe]] designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a [[stalactite]]-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada, Spain]] are among the best known.  Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with [[marquetry]] inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop.<ref>[[:File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|Table]] in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]</ref>  The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used.<ref>Rogers and Ward, 156</ref>  There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods.  A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art.  Other famous wooden roofs are in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].\n\n===Ivory===\n\n[[File:Panel hunters Louvre OA 6265-1.jpg|left|upright=<!--size for low image-->1.3|thumb|Ivory with traces of paint, 11th\u201312th century, Egypt]]\n[[Ivory carving#Islamic ivory|Ivory carving]] centred on the [[Mediterranean]], spreading from Egypt, where a thriving [[Copt]]ic industry had been inherited;  Persian ivory is rare.  The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted.  Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes.  They were produced mainly in the approximate period 930\u20131050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality.  In the 12th and 13th century workshops in [[Norman Sicily]] produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution.  Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture \u2013 most are now detached from their settings.  Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.<ref>Arts, 147\u2013150, and exhibits following</ref>\n[[File:IlkhanateSilkCircular.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ilkhanid]] piece in silk, cotton and gold, Iran or Iraq, early 14th century]]\n\n===Silk===\n\nDespite [[Hadithic]] sayings against the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam.  Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle.  These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions.  The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe [[reliquaries]], where the relics were often wrapped in silk.  European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of [[Toul]] in France was wrapped in a silk from the [[Bukhara]] area in modern [[Uzbekistan]], probably when the body was reburied in 820.<ref>Arts, 65\u201368; 74, no. 3</ref>  The [[Shroud of St Josse]] is a famous [[samite]] cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of [[camel]]s and an inscription in [[Kufic]] script, from which the date appears to be before 961.<ref>[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 Louvre, Suaire de St-Josse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623185919/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 |date=2011-06-23 }}.

Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence.  By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97&nbsp;cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in his invasion of Persia in 1543\u201345, before being taken by a Polish general at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic \"portraits\" of plants, as found in other media.<ref>Arts, 68, 71, 82\u201386, 106\u2013108, 110\u2013111, 114\u2013115</ref>\n\n===Indonesian batik===\n{{main|Batik}}\n\nThe development and refinement of [[Indonesia]]n ''[[batik]]'' cloth was closely linked to Islam.  The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged ''batik'' design to become more abstract and intricate.  Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional ''batik''.  However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the [[Garuda]] of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs.\n\nAlthough its existence pre-dates Islam, ''batik'' reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], whose [[sultan]]s encouraged and patronised ''batik'' production.  Today, batik is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Beginnings===\n\n====Pre-dynastic====\n[[File:Mschatta-Fassade (Pergamonmuseum).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mshatta Facade|Palace fa\u00e7ade from Mshatta]] in [[Jordan]], now in the [[Pergamon Museum, Berlin]], c.&nbsp;?740]]  \nThe period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day [[Syria]]. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or [[Sasanian art|Sasanian]] and [[Byzantine art]], and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial [[spread of Islam]]. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the [[Louvre]], whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions.\n\nInfluences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. [[Bedouin]] tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories.  For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over.\n\n====Umayyad====\n[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Mosaics west.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaics from the ''riwaq'' (portico) of the [[Umayyad Mosque]]]]\nReligious and civic architecture were developed under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]s (661\u2013750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice.\n\nThe [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence ([[mosaic]] against a gold background, and a central plan that recalls that of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic [[frieze]]. The desert palaces in Jordan and Syria (for example, [[Mshatta Facade|Mshatta]], [[Qusayr 'Amra]], and [[Hisham's Palace]]) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury.\n\nWork in ceramics was still somewhat primitive and unglazed during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period.\n\n'Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock's construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art.\n\nIn this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian [[late antiquity]], which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of [[Damascus]] are based on Byzantine models but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated [[Quran]]s.\n\n====Abbasid====\n[[File:Cup Susa Louvre MAO568.jpg|thumb|[[Lusterware]] bowl from [[Susa]], 9th century, today in the Louvre]]\nThe [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750\u20131258<ref>Gruber, World of Art</ref>) witnessed the movement of the capital from Damascus to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. [[art history|Art historian]] Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an \"Islamic [[Rome]]\", because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the \"navel of the world\", as 9th-century historian al-Ya'qubi wrote.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.40</ref>\n\nThe ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, [[Abbasid Samarra]], which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of [[stucco]] reliefs, in which the prehistory of the [[arabesque]] can be traced.  Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran.\n\nSamarra witnessed the \"coming of age\" of Islamic art. Polychrome painted [[stucco]] allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of [[faience]], and of metallic [[lusterware]]. [[Hadith]]ic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic [[lusterware]] in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine [[Chinese porcelain]] led to the development of this technique.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.54</ref>\n\n[[File:Tiraz Textile Fragment with Inscriptions with Name of Caliph al-Muti', 946-974.jpg|thumb|upright=<!--size for low image-->1.3|Tiraz Textile Fragment, 946\u2013974 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThough the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as ''[[tiraz]]'' produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the [[Silk Road]].\n\n[[Islamic calligraphy]] began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated qur'ans gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.58</ref>\n\n===Medieval period (9th\u201315th centuries)===\nBeginning in the ninth century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of a [[Ismailism|Isma\u02bbili Shi\u02bbi]] dynasty, that of the [[North Africa]]n [[Fatimid Caliphate]], followed by the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in [[Iran]].\n\n====Spain and the Maghreb====\n[[File:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|thumb|Moroccan [[Islamic embroidery|Embroidery]] [[fly mask]]]]\n[[File:Pyxid Al Mughira OA 4068.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pyxis of al-Mughira]], [[Medina Azahara]], Spain, 968]]\n\nThe first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Iberia, known in Arabic as [[al-Andalus]], was the Umayyads, descended from the great Umayyad Caliphate of Syria. After their fall, they were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the [[taifa]]s (1031\u201391), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of [[Granada]], ruled by the [[Nasrid dynasty]], who managed to maintain their hold until 1492.\n\nAl-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of [[Averroes]]), the territory was an equally vital center for art.\n\nMany techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The [[pyxis of al-Mughira]] is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints\u2019 [[reliquaries]]. From the periods of [[Maghreb]]i rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork.\n\nThe art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork.\n\n====Arab Mashriq====\nThe Fatimid Caliphate, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171, introduced crafts and knowledge from politically-troubled Baghdad to their capital of [[Cairo]].\n\nBy 1070, the [[Seljuq Empire]] emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at [[Manzikert]]. During the rule of [[Malik-Shah I]], the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the [[atabeg]]s (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish [[Crusades|crusaders]]. In 1171, [[Saladin]] seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory [[Ayyubid dynasty]] on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enamelled glass became another important craft.\n\nIn 1250, [[Mamluk]]s seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids as the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]], and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was [[Baibars]]. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects; many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period. Patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enamelled glass and metalwork and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt. The [[Baptist\u00e8re de Saint Louis]] in the [[Louvre]] is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period.\n\n====Iran and Central Asia====\n[[File:SamarkandBibiKhanym.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]], [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], built by [[Timur]] in 1399]]\nIran and the north of India, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]], and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze.\n\nThe [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]], nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of \"Seljuq\" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]] to [[Merv]], [[Nishapur]], [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and [[Isfahan]], all in Iran.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.89</ref>\n[[File:Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze and designed by anthropic figure with bull head Golestan, Gorgan 9th century CE, Early Islamic period.jpg|thumb|Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran]]\nPopular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth.   Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece.  For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques.  Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.91</ref>  Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated.  In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous.  It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), Chapter 4</ref>\n\nInnovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a [[silicon]] paste (\"[[fritware]]\"), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals.  Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen.  These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.<ref>Hillenbrand, p.100</ref>\n\nDuring the 13th century, the [[Mongols]] under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]] swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] in China, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] in Iran and the [[Golden Horde]] in northern Iran and southern Russia.\n\n=====Ilkhanids=====\nA rich civilization developed under these \"little khans\", who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north\u2013south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of \"iranisation\" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the \"Iranian plan\" mosques, was resumed. The [[Persian miniature|art of the Persian book]] was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.\n\n=====The Golden Horde and the Timurids=====\nThe early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].\n\nThe beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of [[Timur]]. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as [[Kam\u0101l ud-D\u012bn Behz\u0101d]], but also a multitude of workshops and patrons.\n\n====Syria, Iraq, Anatolia====\n[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|[[\u00c7ifte Minareli Medrese (Erzurum)|\u00c7ifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum. Before 1265]]\nThe Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period.\n\n[[Caravanserai]]s dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai [[inns]] improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques.\n\nThe [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] were nomads who settled in the area of [[Lake Van]]. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the [[The Blue Mosque of Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] in [[Tabriz]], and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]], who, after 1450, are referred to as the \"first Ottomans\". Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the \"Milet\" ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works.\n\nIslamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century [[book frontispiece]]s.\n\nEarlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic [[epigraphy|epigraph]]s, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, coinage began to feature [[astrology|astrological]], figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers' busts), and animal images.\n\nHillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called ''[[Maqama]]t'', copied and illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti]] were some of the earliest \"[[coffee table book]]s\". They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.<ref>Hillenbrand, p.128-131</ref>\n\n====Indian subcontinent====\n[[File:RedFortAgra-Musamman-Burj-20080211-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] inlays at the  [[Agra Fort]], India.]]\nThe Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Later other competing sultanates were founded in [[Bengal Sultanate|Bengal]], [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], [[Gujarat]], [[Jaunpur Sultanate|Jaunpur]], [[Malwa (Madhya Pradesh)|Malwa]], and in the north [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmanids]]). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with [[Hindu]] art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], who progressively seized their territories.\n\n===The Three Empires===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n\n====Ottomans====\n[[File:Iznik ware 1500 1510.jpg|thumb|left|16th century [[\u0130znik pottery]]]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]], whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after [[World War I]]. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably [[\u0130znik pottery|Iznik ware]], important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling [[Ebru]], [[Turkish carpet]]s as well as tapestries and exceptional [[Ottoman miniature]]s and decorative [[Ottoman illumination]].\n\nMasterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two \"[[Surname-I H\u00fcmayun|books of festivals]]\" (Surname-I H\u00fcmayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan [[Murad III]]. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century.\n\nThe Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, \"Iznik red\", in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models.  From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of [[Rococo]] which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration.<ref>Levey, chapters 5 and 6</ref> European-style painting was slow to be adopted, with [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] (1842-1910) for long a somewhat solitary figure. He was a member of the Ottoman administrative elite who trained in Paris, and painted throughout his long career as a senior administrator and curator in Turkey. Many of his works represent [[Orientalism]] from the inside, as it were.\n\n====Mughals====\n[[File:The marriage procession of Dara Shikoh - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An illustrated manuscript of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] attending the marriage procession of his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]]. Mughal-Era [[fireworks]] brightened the night throughout the wedding ceremony.]]\nThe [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the [[British Raj]], who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later [[Sikh]] rulers as well. The [[Mughal miniature]] began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by [[Humayun]] when in exile in [[Safavid]] Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style.  Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas.  The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western [[graphical perspective]], and a wider range of poses in the human figure.  Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from.  As the courts of local [[Nawab]]s developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional [[Indian painting]] developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts.\n\nThe arts of jewelry and [[hardstone carving]] of gemstones, such as [[jasper]], [[jade]], adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]], and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses\u2019 heads is particularly impressive.\n\nThe Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced [[Damascus steel]] and refined the locally produced [[Wootz steel]], the Mughals also introduced the \"bidri\" technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like [[Ali Kashmiri]] and [[Muhammed Salih Thatawi]] created the [[wikt:seamless|seamless]] [[celestial globes]].\n\n====Safavids and Qajars====\n[[File:Sheykh lotfollah mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to [[Sheykh Lotfollah mosque]], [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], [[Isfahan]]]]\nThe Iranian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi'a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia.  Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] in [[Isfahan]], which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as [[\u0100l\u012b Q\u0101p\u016b|Ali Qapu]]), an immense bazaar, and a [[Shah Mosque (Isfahan)|large imperial mosque]].\n\n[[File:Fes Medersa Bou Inania Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bou Inania Madrasa]], [[Fes]], [[Morocco]], [[zellige]] mosaic tiles forming elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] [[tessellations]]]]\n\nThe art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] [[Shahnameh]], an immense copy of [[Ferdowsi]]\u2019s poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album ([[muraqqa]]). The albums were the creations of connoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]] figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the [[grisaille]] techniques previously used for border paintings for the background.\n\nAfter the fall of the Safavids, the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]], a [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribe established from centuries on the banks of the [[Caspian Sea]], assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War.\n\n=== Modern period ===\nFrom the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court.  From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries.  Many industries with very long histories, such as [[Persian pottery|pottery in Iran]], largely closed, while others, like metalwork in [[brass]], became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica.\n\nThe carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world.  Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the [[zellige]] mosaic tiles of the [[Maghreb]], have often survived better.  Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art worlds in some countries, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as \"Islamic art\" is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy.  Especially in the oil-rich parts of the Islamic world much modern architecture and interior decoration makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Calligraffiti]]\n* [[Islamic culture]]\n* [[Islamic graffiti]]\n* [[List of museums of Islamic art]]\n* [[Siyah Qalam]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{History of art sidebar}}\n'''Books and journals'''\n*\"Arts\": Jones, Dalu & Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}\n*{{cite journal | last=Ali | first=Wijdan | authorlink=Wijdan Ali | title=From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's Portrayal from 13th Century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th Century Ottoman Art | url=http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf | journal=EJOS | volume=4 | issue=7 | year=2001 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041203232347/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf | archivedate=2004-12-03 }}\n*Blair, S.

Religious Islamic art has been typically characterized by the absence of figures and extensive use of [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]], [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|abstract floral]] patterns. However, representations of Islamic religious figures are found in some manuscripts from [[Persianate society|Persianate cultures]], including [[Ottoman Turkey]] and [[Mughal India]]. These pictures were meant to illustrate the story and not to infringe on the Islamic prohibition of idolatry, but many Muslims regard such images as forbidden.<ref name=esposito/> In secular art of the Muslim world, representations of human and animal forms historically flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures, although, partly because of opposing religious sentiments, figures in paintings were often stylized, giving rise to a variety of decorative figural designs.<ref name=met/>\n\n== Calligraphy ==\n{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}\n[[File:Courtyard of the S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey 004.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Tiles with some calligraphy in the courtyard of the [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]] ([[Turkey]])]]\nCalligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]], religious exhortations, including Qur'anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings. Use of Islamic calligraphy in architecture extended significantly outside of Islamic territories; one notable example is the use of [[Chinese calligraphy]] of Arabic verses from the Qur'an in the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bondak|first1=Marwa|title=Islamic Art History: An Influential Period|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/islamic-art-history-an-influential-period/|website=Mozaico|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=2017-04-25}}</ref> Other inscriptions include verses of poetry, and inscriptions recording ownership or donation. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic ''[[kufic]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of [[minbar]]s, and metalwork.<ref name=\"JAACMadden\"/> Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures are sometimes referred to as ''quranic art''.<ref>Islamic Archaeology in the Sudan - Page 22, Intisar Soghayroun Elzein - 2004</ref>\n\nEast Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called \"epigraphic ware\", has been described as \"probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery\".<ref>Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278\u2013290</ref>  Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in [[relief]], or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings.  Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production.  The [[tughra]] or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones.  Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur'anic verses, or other texts.\n\nThe main languages, all using [[Arabic script]], are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], always used for Qur'anic verses, [[Farsi|Persian]] in the [[Persianate]] world, especially for poetry, and [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], with [[Urdu]] appearing in later centuries.  Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.\n\n== Painting ==\n[[File:Khamseh Nizami 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Scene from the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', Persian, 1539\u201343]]\n{{see also|Arabic miniature|Ottoman miniature|Persian miniature|Mughal miniature}}\n\nAlthough there has been a tradition of wall-paintings, especially in the [[Persianate]] world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, or later as a single page for inclusion in a ''[[muraqqa]]'' or bound album of miniatures and [[calligraphy]].  The tradition of the [[Persian miniature]] has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the [[Ottoman miniature]] of Turkey and the [[Mughal miniature]] in India. Miniatures were especially an art of the court, and because they were not seen in public, it has been argued that constraints on the depiction of the human figure were much more relaxed, and indeed miniatures often contain great numbers of small figures, and from the 16th century portraits of single ones.  Although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts, notably several of the [[Umayyad Desert Castles]] (c. 660-750), and during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749\u20131258).<ref>{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom |author2=S. Blair |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&pg=RA1-PA192&lpg=RA1-PA192&dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe largest commissions of illustrated books were usually classics of [[Persian poetry]] such as the epic ''[[Shahnameh]]'', although the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s both produced lavish manuscripts of more recent history with the autobiographies of the Mughal emperors, and more purely military chronicles of Turkish conquests.  Portraits of rulers developed in the 16th century, and later in Persia, then becoming very popular. Mughal portraits, normally in profile, are very finely drawn in a realist style, while the best Ottoman ones are vigorously stylized.  Album miniatures typically featured picnic scenes, portraits of individuals or (in India especially) animals, or idealized youthful beauties of either sex.\n\nChinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky.  The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size.  The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear.  The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.\n\n== Rugs and carpets ==\n{{Main|Oriental rugs}}\n{{see also|Turkish carpet|Persian carpet|Kilim}}\n[[File:Farsh1.jpg|400px|thumb|left|From the yarn fiber to the colors, every part of the [[Persian rug]] is traditionally handmade from natural ingredients over the course of many months]]\nNo Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the ''Oriental carpet'' ([[oriental rug]]). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a [[prayer rug]], which would provide a clean place to pray).  They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the [[Netherlands]].  Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments.  In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.<ref>Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, ''David L. Janson's History of Art'', Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, {{ISBN|0-13-193455-4}} pg. 298</ref>\n\n[[File:Antique oushak 418424.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] [[Ushak carpet]]]]\nVery early Islamic carpets, i.e. those before the 16th century, are extremely rare. More have survived in the West and [[oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] from Europe are a major source of information on them, as they were valuable imports that were painted accurately.<ref>King and Sylvester, throughout, but 9\u201328, 49\u201350, & 59 in particular</ref>  The most natural and easy designs for a carpet weaver to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way.  Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.\n\nThere are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the [[Pitti Palace]] in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer.<ref>King and Sylvester, 27, 61\u201362, as \"The Medici Mamluk Carpet\"</ref>  Production of this style of carpet began under the [[Mamluks]] but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt.<ref>King and Sylvester, 59\u201366, 79\u201383</ref>  The other sophisticated tradition was the [[Persian carpet]] which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the [[Ardabil Carpet]] and [[Coronation Carpet]]; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition.  These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central ''[[Gul (design)|gul]]'' motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders.  The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today.  The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre.  Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear.\n\nAs well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans.  Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include [[coats of arms]], enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the [[Papal Palace, Avignon]], and the industry continued after the [[Reconquista]].<ref>King and Sylvester: Spanish carpets: 11\u201312, 50\u201352; Balkans: 77 and ''passim''</ref>  [[Armenian carpet]]-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought.  The [[Berber carpet]]s of North Africa have a distinct design tradition.  Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs.  As well as pile carpets, [[kelim]]s and other types of flat-weave or [[embroidered]] textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls.   Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Great mosque of damascus 709-15 AD, syria, easter 2004 - 1463689043.jpg|thumb|Great Mosque of Damascus, 709-715 AD, Syria, constructed by the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I]]\n{{Main|Islamic architecture}}\n\n=== Columns ===\nEarly Islamic columns followed the style seen in the classic period of the Mediterranean.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/|title=Columns in Islamic Architecture|last=Graves|first=Margaret|date=2 June 2009|website=|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Classic columns can be seen in earlier mosques such as the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba Mosque|C\u00f3rdoba]].

Early pottery is often unglazed, but [[Tin-glazing|tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]], originating from 9th century Iraq.<ref>Mason (1995), p. 5</ref> The first industrial complex for [[glass]] and [[pottery]] production was built in [[Raqqa]], [[Syria]], in the 8th century.<ref name=Henderson>{{Cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Henderson |first2=S.

Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected.  Until the [[Early Modern]] period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied.  An example of this is the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence.\n\n[[File:Animal Decorated Ottoman Pottery P1000585.JPG|thumb|[[Iznik pottery|Iznik glazed pottery]] ca. 1575]]\n\nThe [[Hispano-Moresque]] style emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] or Muslim Spain in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two [[ceramic]] techniques to [[Europe]]: [[ceramic glaze|glazing]] with an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] white [[tin-glazing|tin-glaze]], and [[Lusterware|painting in metallic lusters]].  Ottoman [[\u0130znik pottery]] produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics.  These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.<ref>Savage, 175, suggests that the Persians had made some experiments towards producing it, and the earliest European porcelain, [[Medici porcelain]], was made in the late 16th century, perhaps with a Persian or [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] assistant on the team.</ref>\n\nThe medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery.

From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured [[tile|tiling]] for interior and exterior walls and [[dome]]s developed.  Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns.  Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme \u2013 a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing.\n\nSome elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional [[relief]], and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures.  These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals.  The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs.  The geometric patterns, such as modern North African [[zellige]] work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as \"[[mosaic]]\", which is not strictly correct.\n\nThe Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) \"parchin kari\", a type of [[pietra dura]] decoration from inlaid panels of semi-precious stones, with jewels in some cases.  This can be seen at the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]] and other imperial commissions.  The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.\n\n== Glass ==\n{{main|Islamic glass}}\n[[File:Luckofedenhall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"The [[Luck of Edenhall]]\", a 13th-century Syrian beaker, in England since the Middle Ages]]\n\nFor most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in [[Eurasia]], exported to both Europe and China.  Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of [[Sassanian glass|Sassanian]] and [[Ancient Roman glass]], and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre-Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially  formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in [[Egypt]].  For this reason it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties.<ref>Arts, 131, 135.

Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects.  [[Gilding|Gilded]], painted and [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork.  Some of the finest work was in [[mosque lamp]]s donated by a ruler or wealthy man.  As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it \"often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles\".<ref>Arts, 131\u2013135, 141\u2013146; quote, 134</ref>  [[Aleppo]] seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the [[Mongol invasion]] of 1260, and [[Timur]] appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to [[Samarkand]].

In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in [[brass]], bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental, shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black [[niello]].  The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down.  The abundant local sources of [[zinc]] compared to [[tin]] explains the rarity of [[bronze]].  Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid.<ref name=Baer1983>{{cite book |last=Baer |first=Eva |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s__yi4pD-VEC |year=1983 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4 |pages=whole book}}</ref>\n\nThe use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s, as was the wearing of gold rings.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]</ref>  One thing Islamic metalworkers shared with European ones was high social status compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed.\n\nIslamic work includes some three-dimensional animal figures as fountainheads or [[aquamanile]]s, but only one significant enamelled object is known, using Byzantine [[cloisonne]] techniques.<ref>Arts, 201, and earlier pages for animal shapes.</ref>  The [[Pisa Griffin]] is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andaluz.

Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, so are often lavishly treated display pieces.

Blade of [[damascening|damascened]] steel inlaid with gold.]]\nHigh levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including [[hardstone carving]]s and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone.  Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur'an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters.  Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and [[lacquer]] over paint.<ref>See the relevant sections in \"Arts\"</ref>\n\n===Precious stones===\n\nEgyptian carving of [[rock crystal]] into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040.  There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the [[Cairo]] palace of the [[Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries.<ref>[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]</ref> From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels.  Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.<ref>Arts, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\n===House and furniture===\n[[File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman [[marquetry]] and tile-top table, about 1560]]\nOlder wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes.  An important exception are the complex [[muqarnas]] and [[moc\u00e1rabe]] designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a [[stalactite]]-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada, Spain]] are among the best known.  Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with [[marquetry]] inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop.<ref>[[:File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|Table]] in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]</ref>  The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used.<ref>Rogers and Ward, 156</ref>  There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods.  A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art.  Other famous wooden roofs are in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].\n\n===Ivory===\n\n[[File:Panel hunters Louvre OA 6265-1.jpg|left|upright=<!--size for low image-->1.3|thumb|Ivory with traces of paint, 11th\u201312th century, Egypt]]\n[[Ivory carving#Islamic ivory|Ivory carving]] centred on the [[Mediterranean]], spreading from Egypt, where a thriving [[Copt]]ic industry had been inherited;  Persian ivory is rare.  The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted.  Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes.  They were produced mainly in the approximate period 930\u20131050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality.  In the 12th and 13th century workshops in [[Norman Sicily]] produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution.  Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture \u2013 most are now detached from their settings.  Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.<ref>Arts, 147\u2013150, and exhibits following</ref>\n[[File:IlkhanateSilkCircular.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ilkhanid]] piece in silk, cotton and gold, Iran or Iraq, early 14th century]]\n\n===Silk===\n\nDespite [[Hadithic]] sayings against the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam.  Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle.  These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions.  The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe [[reliquaries]], where the relics were often wrapped in silk.  European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of [[Toul]] in France was wrapped in a silk from the [[Bukhara]] area in modern [[Uzbekistan]], probably when the body was reburied in 820.<ref>Arts, 65\u201368; 74, no. 3</ref>  The [[Shroud of St Josse]] is a famous [[samite]] cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of [[camel]]s and an inscription in [[Kufic]] script, from which the date appears to be before 961.<ref>[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 Louvre, Suaire de St-Josse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623185919/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 |date=2011-06-23 }}.

Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence.  By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97&nbsp;cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in his invasion of Persia in 1543\u201345, before being taken by a Polish general at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic \"portraits\" of plants, as found in other media.<ref>Arts, 68, 71, 82\u201386, 106\u2013108, 110\u2013111, 114\u2013115</ref>\n\n===Indonesian batik===\n{{main|Batik}}\n\nThe development and refinement of [[Indonesia]]n ''[[batik]]'' cloth was closely linked to Islam.  The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged ''batik'' design to become more abstract and intricate.  Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional ''batik''.  However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the [[Garuda]] of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs.\n\nAlthough its existence pre-dates Islam, ''batik'' reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], whose [[sultan]]s encouraged and patronised ''batik'' production.  Today, batik is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Beginnings===\n\n====Pre-dynastic====\n[[File:Mschatta-Fassade (Pergamonmuseum).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mshatta Facade|Palace fa\u00e7ade from Mshatta]] in [[Jordan]], now in the [[Pergamon Museum, Berlin]], c.&nbsp;?740]]  \nThe period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day [[Syria]]. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or [[Sasanian art|Sasanian]] and [[Byzantine art]], and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial [[spread of Islam]]. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the [[Louvre]], whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions.\n\nInfluences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. [[Bedouin]] tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories.  For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over.\n\n====Umayyad====\n[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Mosaics west.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaics from the ''riwaq'' (portico) of the [[Umayyad Mosque]]]]\nReligious and civic architecture were developed under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]s (661\u2013750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice.\n\nThe [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence ([[mosaic]] against a gold background, and a central plan that recalls that of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic [[frieze]]. The desert palaces in Jordan and Syria (for example, [[Mshatta Facade|Mshatta]], [[Qusayr 'Amra]], and [[Hisham's Palace]]) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury.\n\nWork in ceramics was still somewhat primitive and unglazed during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period.\n\n'Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock's construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art.\n\nIn this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian [[late antiquity]], which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of [[Damascus]] are based on Byzantine models but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated [[Quran]]s.\n\n====Abbasid====\n[[File:Cup Susa Louvre MAO568.jpg|thumb|[[Lusterware]] bowl from [[Susa]], 9th century, today in the Louvre]]\nThe [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750\u20131258<ref>Gruber, World of Art</ref>) witnessed the movement of the capital from Damascus to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. [[art history|Art historian]] Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an \"Islamic [[Rome]]\", because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the \"navel of the world\", as 9th-century historian al-Ya'qubi wrote.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.40</ref>\n\nThe ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, [[Abbasid Samarra]], which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of [[stucco]] reliefs, in which the prehistory of the [[arabesque]] can be traced.  Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran.\n\nSamarra witnessed the \"coming of age\" of Islamic art. Polychrome painted [[stucco]] allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of [[faience]], and of metallic [[lusterware]]. [[Hadith]]ic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic [[lusterware]] in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine [[Chinese porcelain]] led to the development of this technique.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.54</ref>\n\n[[File:Tiraz Textile Fragment with Inscriptions with Name of Caliph al-Muti', 946-974.jpg|thumb|upright=<!--size for low image-->1.3|Tiraz Textile Fragment, 946\u2013974 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThough the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as ''[[tiraz]]'' produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the [[Silk Road]].\n\n[[Islamic calligraphy]] began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated qur'ans gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.58</ref>\n\n===Medieval period (9th\u201315th centuries)===\nBeginning in the ninth century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of a [[Ismailism|Isma\u02bbili Shi\u02bbi]] dynasty, that of the [[North Africa]]n [[Fatimid Caliphate]], followed by the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in [[Iran]].\n\n====Spain and the Maghreb====\n[[File:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|thumb|Moroccan [[Islamic embroidery|Embroidery]] [[fly mask]]]]\n[[File:Pyxid Al Mughira OA 4068.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pyxis of al-Mughira]], [[Medina Azahara]], Spain, 968]]\n\nThe first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Iberia, known in Arabic as [[al-Andalus]], was the Umayyads, descended from the great Umayyad Caliphate of Syria. After their fall, they were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the [[taifa]]s (1031\u201391), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of [[Granada]], ruled by the [[Nasrid dynasty]], who managed to maintain their hold until 1492.\n\nAl-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of [[Averroes]]), the territory was an equally vital center for art.\n\nMany techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The [[pyxis of al-Mughira]] is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints\u2019 [[reliquaries]]. From the periods of [[Maghreb]]i rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork.\n\nThe art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork.\n\n====Arab Mashriq====\nThe Fatimid Caliphate, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171, introduced crafts and knowledge from politically-troubled Baghdad to their capital of [[Cairo]].\n\nBy 1070, the [[Seljuq Empire]] emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at [[Manzikert]]. During the rule of [[Malik-Shah I]], the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the [[atabeg]]s (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish [[Crusades|crusaders]]. In 1171, [[Saladin]] seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory [[Ayyubid dynasty]] on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enamelled glass became another important craft.\n\nIn 1250, [[Mamluk]]s seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids as the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]], and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was [[Baibars]]. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects; many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period. Patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enamelled glass and metalwork and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt. The [[Baptist\u00e8re de Saint Louis]] in the [[Louvre]] is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period.\n\n====Iran and Central Asia====\n[[File:SamarkandBibiKhanym.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]], [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], built by [[Timur]] in 1399]]\nIran and the north of India, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]], and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze.\n\nThe [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]], nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of \"Seljuq\" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]] to [[Merv]], [[Nishapur]], [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and [[Isfahan]], all in Iran.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.89</ref>\n[[File:Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze and designed by anthropic figure with bull head Golestan, Gorgan 9th century CE, Early Islamic period.jpg|thumb|Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran]]\nPopular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth.   Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece.  For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques.  Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), p.91</ref>  Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated.  In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous.  It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.<ref>Hillenbrand (1999), Chapter 4</ref>\n\nInnovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a [[silicon]] paste (\"[[fritware]]\"), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals.  Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen.  These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.<ref>Hillenbrand, p.100</ref>\n\nDuring the 13th century, the [[Mongols]] under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]] swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] in China, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] in Iran and the [[Golden Horde]] in northern Iran and southern Russia.\n\n=====Ilkhanids=====\nA rich civilization developed under these \"little khans\", who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north\u2013south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of \"iranisation\" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the \"Iranian plan\" mosques, was resumed. The [[Persian miniature|art of the Persian book]] was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.\n\n=====The Golden Horde and the Timurids=====\nThe early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].\n\nThe beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of [[Timur]]. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as [[Kam\u0101l ud-D\u012bn Behz\u0101d]], but also a multitude of workshops and patrons.\n\n====Syria, Iraq, Anatolia====\n[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|[[\u00c7ifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum. Before 1265]]\nThe Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period.\n\n[[Caravanserai]]s dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai [[inns]] improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques.\n\nThe [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] were nomads who settled in the area of [[Lake Van]]. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the [[The Blue Mosque of Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] in [[Tabriz]], and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]], who, after 1450, are referred to as the \"first Ottomans\". Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the \"Milet\" ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works.\n\nIslamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century [[book frontispiece]]s.\n\nEarlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic [[epigraphy|epigraph]]s, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, coinage began to feature [[astrology|astrological]], figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers' busts), and animal images.\n\nHillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called ''[[Maqama]]t'', copied and illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti]] were some of the earliest \"[[coffee table book]]s\". They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.<ref>Hillenbrand, p.128-131</ref>\n\n====Indian subcontinent====\n[[File:RedFortAgra-Musamman-Burj-20080211-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] inlays at the  [[Agra Fort]], India.]]\nThe Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Later other competing sultanates were founded in [[Bengal Sultanate|Bengal]], [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], [[Gujarat]], [[Jaunpur Sultanate|Jaunpur]], [[Malwa (Madhya Pradesh)|Malwa]], and in the north [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmanids]]). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with [[Hindu]] art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], who progressively seized their territories.\n\n===The Three Empires===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n\n====Ottomans====\n[[File:Iznik ware 1500 1510.jpg|thumb|left|16th century [[\u0130znik pottery]]]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]], whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after [[World War I]]. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably [[\u0130znik pottery|Iznik ware]], important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling [[Ebru]], [[Turkish carpet]]s as well as tapestries and exceptional [[Ottoman miniature]]s and decorative [[Ottoman illumination]].\n\nMasterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two \"[[Surname-I H\u00fcmayun|books of festivals]]\" (Surname-I H\u00fcmayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan [[Murad III]]. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century.\n\nThe Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, \"Iznik red\", in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models.  From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of [[Rococo]] which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration.<ref>Levey, chapters 5 and 6</ref> European-style painting was slow to be adopted, with [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] (1842-1910) for long a somewhat solitary figure. He was a member of the Ottoman administrative elite who trained in Paris, and painted throughout his long career as a senior administrator and curator in Turkey. Many of his works represent [[Orientalism]] from the inside, as it were.\n\n====Mughals====\n[[File:The marriage procession of Dara Shikoh - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An illustrated manuscript of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] attending the marriage procession of his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]]. Mughal-Era [[fireworks]] brightened the night throughout the wedding ceremony.]]\nThe [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the [[British Raj]], who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later [[Sikh]] rulers as well. The [[Mughal miniature]] began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by [[Humayun]] when in exile in [[Safavid]] Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style.  Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas.  The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western [[graphical perspective]], and a wider range of poses in the human figure.  Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from.  As the courts of local [[Nawab]]s developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional [[Indian painting]] developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts.\n\nThe arts of jewelry and [[hardstone carving]] of gemstones, such as [[jasper]], [[jade]], adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]], and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses\u2019 heads is particularly impressive.\n\nThe Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced [[Damascus steel]] and refined the locally produced [[Wootz steel]], the Mughals also introduced the \"bidri\" technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like [[Ali Kashmiri]] and [[Muhammed Salih Thatawi]] created the [[wikt:seamless|seamless]] [[celestial globes]].\n\n====Safavids and Qajars====\n[[File:Sheykh lotfollah mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to [[Sheykh Lotfollah mosque]], [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], [[Isfahan]]]]\nThe Iranian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi'a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia.  Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] in [[Isfahan]], which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as [[\u0100l\u012b Q\u0101p\u016b|Ali Qapu]]), an immense bazaar, and a [[Shah Mosque (Isfahan)|large imperial mosque]].\n\n[[File:Fes Medersa Bou Inania Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bou Inania Madrasa]], [[Fes]], [[Morocco]], [[zellige]] mosaic tiles forming elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] [[tessellations]]]]\n\nThe art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] [[Shahnameh]], an immense copy of [[Ferdowsi]]\u2019s poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album ([[muraqqa]]). The albums were the creations of connoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]] figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the [[grisaille]] techniques previously used for border paintings for the background.\n\nAfter the fall of the Safavids, the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]], a [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribe established from centuries on the banks of the [[Caspian Sea]], assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War.\n\n=== Modern period ===\nFrom the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court.  From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries.  Many industries with very long histories, such as [[Persian pottery|pottery in Iran]], largely closed, while others, like metalwork in [[brass]], became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica.\n\nThe carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world.  Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the [[zellige]] mosaic tiles of the [[Maghreb]], have often survived better.  Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art worlds in some countries, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as \"Islamic art\" is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy.  Especially in the oil-rich parts of the Islamic world much modern architecture and interior decoration makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Calligraffiti]]\n* [[Islamic culture]]\n* [[Islamic graffiti]]\n* [[List of museums of Islamic art]]\n* [[Siyah Qalam]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{History of art sidebar}}\n'''Books and journals'''\n*\"Arts\": Jones, Dalu & Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}\n*{{cite journal | last=Ali | first=Wijdan | authorlink=Wijdan Ali | title=From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's Portrayal from 13th Century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th Century Ottoman Art | url=http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf | journal=EJOS | volume=4 | issue=7 | year=2001 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041203232347/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf | archivedate=2004-12-03 }}\n*Blair, S.
