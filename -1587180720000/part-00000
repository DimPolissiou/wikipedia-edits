It is intended to alleviate the severe shortage of [[Health in Ethiopia|medical doctors in the country]]. In line with various encouraging efforts performed by the [[Ministry of Health (Ethiopia)|Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health]] in this regard, it is clear that the newly opened school, with a practical modular and integrated curriculum,{{clarify|date=December 2011}} will be providing much-needed medical professionals to the people of Ethiopia.\n\nThe school was established by the ministry with the initiative of [[Tedros Adhanom]] (the then-minister) together with Gordon Williams of the department of [[urology]] at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in London as its first dean.\n\n==Student body==\nThe students are selected by written exam and structured interview with their previous educational background and their motive to work in the homeland accredited. The students come from all regions in Ethiopia, with students from emerging and underrepresented regions given special consideration.

During the nineteenth century, students studied Philosophy, Theology, Mathematics, Languages and Law at Carlow College. It was founded in 1782. The delay in accepting students was due to resistance from the local [[Church of Ireland]] Bishop, but the passing of the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791|Relief Act of 1792]] obviated the need for his permission.\n\nFrom 1793 to 1892, it educated both lay people and those studying for the priesthood.

During the nineteenth century, students studied Philosophy, Theology, Mathematics, Languages and Law at Carlow College. It was founded in 1782. The delay in accepting students was due to resistance from the local [[Church of Ireland]] Bishop, but the passing of the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791|Relief Act of 1792]] obviated the need for his permission. \n\nFrom 1793 to 1892, it educated both lay people and those studying for the priesthood.

On the 2011 CAO Carlow degrees in Citizenship and Community Studies, Humanities (Philosophy and Theology), English and History and Applied Social Studies in Social Care were offered.<ref>[http://www.cao.ie/courses.php Courses PC Carlow College] Central Applications Office 2011</ref> The Humanities degrees are recognised for teaching in secondary schools.<ref>[http://www.pac.ie/hdip/downloads/TRC09.pdf Recognised Post-primary Teaching Qualifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727070337/http://www.pac.ie/hdip/downloads/TRC09.pdf |date=27 July 2011 }} The Teaching Council</ref><ref>[http://www.asti.ie/uploads/media/Registration%20as%20a%20Second%20Level%20Teacher.doc QUALIFICATIONS RECOGNISED BY REGISTRATION COUNCIL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADMISSION TO THE REGISTER OF SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS] ATSI Website, 2002</ref>\n\nOther postgraduate programmes include Higher Diploma in Business Studies in Parish Planning and Administration, Postgraduate Diploma in Equality and Diversity in the Workplace and Master of Arts in Therapeutic Child Care and qualify for tax relief.<ref>[http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/postgraduate-courses-2010-2011.pdf Post Graduate Courses eligible for tax relief in the 2010/2011 Academic Year] www.revenue.ie</ref>\n\nIn the 2006\u201307 academic year, the college opened a magnificently designed state-of-the-art library situated in the old college chapel. The library was named in memory of Fr Patrick Brophy, a former President, who bequeathed his full library to the college. The new facility incorporated the ''Delany Archive'' containing the archives of the [[Brigidine Sisters]], the [[Patrician Brothers]] as well as the college and diocese.<ref>[http://www.delanyarchive.ie/collections.html Delany Archive Collections.]</ref> It effectively charts 200 years of education in the local area. The P.J. Brophy memorial library stocks thousands of texts of the Humanities, in Philosophy, Theology, English Literature, Social Studies and the general Liberal Arts. The opening of the new library coincides with the opening of a new student services centre which is adjacent to the library. On 12 December 2006, the President of Ireland, [[Mary McAleese]], officially opened the Fr P.J.

The 132nd's World War II predecessor unit, the ''365th Fighter Group'' was a [[IX Fighter Command]] unit, serving in the [[European Theater of Operations]]. The 365th, known as the \"Hell Hawks\", was one of the most successful [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighter groups of the [[Ninth Air Force]] when it came to air combat. The 365th was awarded two [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]s; Order of the Day, Belgium Army; Belgium Fourrag\u00e8re, and the Belgium Croix de Guerre. The 365th Fighter Group flew its last mission on 8 May 1945. After having operated manned fighter aircraft for all of its prior history, the wing was equipped with the [[MQ-9 Reaper]] unmanned aerial vehicle in 2013.\n\n==Units==\nThe units of the 132nd Wing include:\n* 132nd Operations Group \n** [[124th Fighter Squadron]] (F-16C/D) Tail Code: \"IA\"\n* 132nd Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Group\n** 232nd Intelligence Squadron\n** 233rd Intelligence Squadron\n* 132nd Mission Support Group\n* 132nd Medical Group\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n[[File:365thfg-beaulieu-1.jpg|thumb|left|Republic P-47D-28-RA Thunderbolt, AAF Ser. No. 42-28932 of the 388th Fighter Squadron.]]\nConstituted as the 365th Fighter Group on 27 April 1943. Activated on 15 May 1943. Trained with P-47's. Moved to [[RAF Gosfield]], England in December 1943. Assigned to [[Ninth Air Force]]. It was several weeks before the 365th received a full complement of 75 P-47D Thunderbolts and mid-February 1944 before they were placed on operational status. Their first mission, flown on 22 February, was a bomber support sweep of short duration over enemy-held territory.\n\nEarly missions were flown in support of Eighth Air Force [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] and [[B-24]] bomber operations and on one of these on 2 March, the 365th had its first encounter with [[Luftwaffe|enemy fighters]] in the [[Bastogne]] area, resulting in the loss of one Thunderbolt and claims of six of the enemy shot down. ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Egon Mayer]], one of the most successful [[Luftwaffe]] aces flying in the West with 102 victories, fell in this battle.\n\nOn 5 March, with only nine missions to its credit, the group moved south to [[RAF Beaulieu]] in Hampshire. The group was stood down three days after arrival so that it could undertake a two-week intensive course in ground attack and fighter-bombing. After training, the 365th flew dive-bombing missions to attack such targets as bridges, aerodromes, rail facilities, gun positions, and V-weapon sites prior to the invasion of the Continent.\n\nOn [[D-Day]], its duties were attacking gun emplacements and communications facilities behind the bridgehead. Two P-47s were lost. On the following day when 12 separate squadron-sized missions were flown five aircraft failed to return.\n\nAn unusual accident occurred on 9 June when two P-47s being delivered to Beaulieu by ferry pilots landed on different runways at the same time and collided at the runway intersection with one pilot being killed.\n\nThe 365th was one of the most successful P-47 groups of the Ninth Air Force when it came to air combat, and a total of 29 enemy aircraft were credited as shot down during the four months the group operated from Beaulieu. On 25 June, the 365th had one of its best days when eight enemy fighter-bombers were destroyed. On 2 July, Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Coffey, Jr., the Air Executive, became the Ninth Air Force's third Thunderbolt ace. As with other P-47 groups, losses were modest until ground attack became a regular task in June. All told, 24 P-47s were 'missing in action' during their stay at Beaulieu.\n\nThe 365th Group began its move to the Continent on 21 June, the first squadron taking up residence at Azeville, France (A-71) on 26 June, the last moving out of Beaulieu on 28 June and the rear party on 2 July providing tactical air support in support of [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]]. On the continent, the group moved rapidly from one airfield to another, eventually winding up near [[Fritzlar]], Germany (Y-86) on [[Victory in Europe Day|VE-Day]].\n\nAfter the end of hostilities, the 365th Fighter Group took part in the disarmament program until June, then returned to the United States in September 1945, being inactivated at Camp Myles Standish, near [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], Massachusetts on 22 September 1945.\n\n===Iowa Air National Guard===\n[[File:124th Fighter Squadron formation 1940s.jpg|thumb|132nd Fighter Wing formation in the 1940s]]\nThe redesignated group was formed with three fighter squadrons, consisting of the [[124th Fighter Squadron]] at Des Moines; the [[174th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Sioux City]], and the [[175th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]].  Engaged in routine training exercises, and was upgraded to [[F-84B Thunderjet]] jet aircraft in early 1948.\n\nThe [[United States Department of War|War Department]] authorized the establishment of [[Air National Guard]] units in all 48 states, with three units comprising a wing based in Sioux Falls, Sioux City and [[Des Moines, Iowa]].

Performed training as a tactical fighter unit until relieved from active service and returned to Iowa ANG jurisdiction in January 1953.\n\n====Cold War====\n[[File:124th Tactical Fighter Squadron - Republic F-84F-25-RE Thunderstreak 51-1655.jpg|thumb|left|124th TFS Republic F-84F-25-RE Thunderstreak, AF Ser. No. 51-1655, about 1970]]\nDuring 1952, over one million dollars of federally funded improvements were added to the Des Moines airport. The work included the addition of 1,800 feet to the main runway and 3,480 feet of taxiways to better accommodate the wing receiving jet aircraft upon their return to peacetime service. After returning to Des Moines, the wing was re-equipped with [[F-80C Shooting Star]] jet fighter-bombers and returned to normal peacetime training committed to [[Tactical Air Command]].  It was later upgraded with newer [[F-84E Thunderjet]]s in 1955.  The wing was transferred to [[Air Defense Command]] in July 1958, becoming an all-weather [[F-86L Sabre Interceptor]] squadron, its new mission being the air defense of Des Moines and eastern Iowa.\n\nIn June 1960, the Lincoln, Nebraska-based 173rd FIS was reassigned to the new Nebraska ANG [[155th Fighter-Interceptor Group]] when the squadron was expanded to a group-level organization.  In a similar reassignment, the Sioux City-based 174th FIS was reassigned to the [[185th Tactical Fighter Group]] on 30 September 1962.  The F-86Ls of the remaining 124th FIS were replaced  \nwith [[F-89J Scorpion]] Interceptors, which the squadron flew until the summer of 1969.\n[[File:124th Tactical Fighter Squadron - North American F-100F-10-NA Super Sabre 56-3880.jpg|thumb|124th TFS North American F-100F-10-NA Super Sabre, AF Ser. No. 56-3880, 1975]]\nThe 132nd was transferred back to TAC in 1969, being re-equipped with second-line [[F-84F Thunderstreak]]s, the standard TAC aircraft for its Air National Guard-gained squadrons at the time. The 132nd upgraded to the [[F-100D Super Sabre]] aircraft, which were returning from [[South Vietnam]] in 1971, and being transferred to the ANG to replace the subsonic F-84's. The wing began receiving new and transferred [[A-7D Corsair II]] ground attack aircraft in 1976 when the National Guard Bureau began modernizing the ANG with frontline aircraft after the drawdown of the regular Air Force following the end of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nWith the retirement of the A-7Ds in the late 1980s, the wing was upgraded to Block 42 [[F-16C Fighting Falcon]]s in 1990.  From 1998 to 2004, as part of the Air Expeditionary Force concept, the wing had an unprecedented six overseas contingency deployments to patrol the No-Fly Zone over Iraq in Operations Northern and Southern Watch. Two of the six contingency deployments occurred within a ten-month period, attesting to the unit's professionalism and high state of readiness.\n\n====Modern era====\n[[File:124th Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7K Corsair II 81-0077.jpg|thumb|left|124th TFS Ling-Temco-Vought A-7K Corsair II, AF Ser.

After 9/11 the unit's F-16's were prepared to launch within minutes in the event of a \"scramble\" order \u2013 24/7. The unit has also provided continuous Combat Air Patrols during Presidential visits.\n\nThe unit was deployed to Al Udeid AB, Qatar in 2005 in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The squadron performed in an exceptional manner, exhibiting an impressive array of capabilities. Outstanding leadership and superb aircraft maintenance skills produced 456 sorties and 3145 flying hours in austere conditions. Total flying hours during this contingency equaled to over three-fourths of a year's normal flying allocation in only 52 days.\n\nThe Wing was validated as the \"Best of the Best\" following its Operation Readiness Inspection in 2004, by Air Combat Command (ACC). Seventy-three percent of 154 rated areas were graded as ''Outstanding'' or ''Excellent''. The Excellent rating was received in each of the four major rated areas of ''Initial Response'', ''Employment'', ''Mission Support'', and ''Ability to Survive and Operate'', a precedent that had not been accomplished by a fighter wing in recent inspections. The 132nd Fighter Wing's rating was one of the highest achieved by an Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard wing in several years. In addition, the Logistics Readiness Squadron received the 2005 Air Reserve Component Base Logistics Activity of the Year Award and the Maintenance Group received the 2005 Air National Guard's Maintenance Effectiveness Award. As a result of its outstanding efforts and commitment to excellence, the Wing was awarded its seventh [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]].\n\nLess than a week after [[Hurricane Katrina]], 12 members of the 132nd Medical Group teamed up with 19 members of the Sioux City 185th Air Refueling Wing and headed south to bring aid to those injured or sick because of the storm. The team treated 80 to 100 patients a day with ailments ranging from minor cuts to dehydration and acute skin infections caused by exposure to bacteria-laden sewer water.\n\nThe 132nd Fighter Wing received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 2009. It was the eighth time the unit was the recipient of this prestigious award.\n\n====Mission Change====\nCongressional actions removed the wing's fighters from the base, with the transition beginning in FY 2013.<ref>http://www.kcci.com/news/central-iowa/Deal-would-pull-F-16s-from-Des-Moines/-/9357080/17829950/-/71eigyz/-/index.html</ref> The last regularly scheduled F-16 flights occurred in August 2013, after which the unit's 21 F-16s were transferred to the [[New Jersey Air National Guard]]'s [[177th Fighter Wing]] at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base]].<ref>http://www.radioiowa.com/2013/08/22/iowas-f-16s-bound-for-new-jersey/</ref>\n\nThe loss of the Falcons created some debate over the base's status as an aeronautical base with a true flying mission, and the airport threatened legal action to begin charging a full market-value lease. This was addressed by the reassignment of UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from Company C, 2nd Battalion, 147th Aviation, [[Iowa Army National Guard]], from Boone, IA to the base, occupying the hangars that held fixed-wing Air Force fighters for 70 years.<ref name=\"sfas\">[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/09/08/guard-move-helicopters-des-moines/71871928/ Guard: Move helicopters to Des Moines]</ref>\n\nBecause of the excellent work during its challenging mission change, the 132d Wing was selected for its 11th [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] in August 2016. As it brought all of its new missions to full operating capacity under budget and ahead of schedule, the Wing was awarded its 12th decoration of the award at the end of 2017.\n\n====Current Missions====\nThe wing moved from a manned fighter wing to a multi-mission unit, including the operation of [[Remotely Piloted Aircraft]], an [[Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance|ISR]] group, and a [[cyber operations]] squadron, adding them to the unit's distributed training operations center.\n\nThe '''132nd Operations Group''' operates the [[MQ-9 Reaper]], a remotely piloted aircraft. Aircrew based and physically located in Des Moines carry out missions in all corners of the world. These aircrews provide real-time full-motion video and flexible strike capabilities to combatant commanders around the globe.\n\nThe '''132nd ISR Group''' provides intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance research and analysis capabilities to enable combatant commanders' planning and operational decision making. Through the use of intelligence information and training, the analysts of this group determine the strengths and weaknesses of an enemy target complex and pass that information off to Weaponeers who determine the best aim point and weapon to achieve the desired target destruction. As part of the 25th Air Force, the 132 ISRG received the [[Air Force Meritorious Unit Award]] in late 2017 for participation in targeting operations worldwide.\n\nThe '''168th Cyberspace Operations Squadron''' is tasked with analyzing and protecting networks and systems by determining vulnerabilities and implementing solutions.\n\nThe '''Distributed Training Operations Center''' ('''DTOC''') is the [[Iowa Air National Guard]] center for [[Distributed Mission Operations]] (located in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]). It operates as a wing detachment. Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) is a component of the Air Force Training Transformation initiative. While the center organizes DMO events primarily for Air National Guard and [[Air Force Reserve Command]] [[aviator|pilot]]s, DTOC also facilitates training between Air National Guard fighter pilots and warfighters in the U.S. Army, Air Force Reserve, Navy, and allied forces.<ref name=\"overview\">{{cite web|title=ANG_Briefing Organizational Overview|url=http://proceedings.ndia.org/41A0/ANG_Briefing.pdf|website=proceedings.ndia.org|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> The center has also has the capability to include non-virtual assets into the simulation, allowing pilots in physical aircraft to participate in the exercises. Such virtual training exercises save the Air Force substantial funds over gathering assets for real-life exercises.\n\n===Lineage===\n[[File:365fg.png|thumb|175px|Legacy 365th Fighter Group emblem]]\n*Constituted as '''[[365th Fighter Group]]''' on 27 April 1943\n: Activated on 15 May 1943\n: Inactivated on 22 September 1945\n* Re-designated '''[[132nd Fighter Group]]''', and allotted to Iowa Air National Guard on 24 May 1946\n: Extended federal recognition on 23 Aug 1946\n: Ordered into active service on 1 April 1951\n: Re-designated '''[[132nd Fighter-Bomber Group]]''' 1 June 1951\n: Relieved from active service and returned, less personnel and equipment, to Iowa ANG, 1 January 1953\n: Re-designated: '''[[132nd Fighter-Interceptor Group]]''' on 1 Jul 1958\n: Re-designated: '''[[132nd Tactical Fighter Group]]''' on 2 Aug 1969\n: Status changed from Group to Wing, 15 Mar 1992\n: Re-designated: '''[[132nd Fighter Wing]]''' on 15 Mar 1992\n: Re-designated: '''132nd Wing''' on 7 Mar 2015\n\n===Assignments===\n* [[I Fighter Command]], 15 May 1943\n: Attached to: [[Philadelphia Fighter Wing]], 19 July \u2013 4 December 1943\n* [[70th Fighter Wing (World War II)|70th Fighter Wing]]\n: Attached to: [[IX Tactical Air Command|IX Air Service Command]], 22 December 1943\n* [[84th Fighter Wing (World War II)|84th Fighter Wing]]\n: Attached to: [[IX Tactical Air Command]], 1 August 1944\n* [[70th Fighter Wing (World War II)|70th Fighter Wing]]\n: Attached to: [[IX Tactical Air Command]], 1 October 1944\n* [[XIX Tactical Air Command]], 16 January 1945\n* [[IX Tactical Air Command]], 1 February \u2013 11 September 1945\n* [[Army Service Forces]] (for inactivation), 20\u201322 September 1945\n* [[71st Fighter Wing (Air National Guard)|71st Fighter Wing]], 23 August 1946\n* [[131st Composite Wing]], 1 November 1950\n* [[Iowa Air National Guard]], 1 March 1951\n: Gained by: [[Tactical Air Command]]\n* [[Strategic Air Command]], 1 April 1951\n* [[Tactical Air Command]], 1 November 1951\n* [[Iowa Air National Guard]], 1 January 1953\n: Gained by: [[Tactical Air Command]]\n: Gained by: [[Air Defense Command]], 1 July 1958\n: Gained by: [[Tactical Air Command]], 2 August 1969\n: Gained by: [[Air Combat Command]], 1 June 1992\n\n===Components===\n\n====World War II====\n* [[386th Fighter Squadron]] (D5), 15 May 1943 \u2013 22 September 1945\n* [[387th Fighter Squadron]] (B4), 15 May 1943 \u2013 22 September 1945\n* [[388th Fighter Squadron]] (C4), 15 May 1943 \u2013 22 September 1945\n\n====Iowa Air National Guard====\n* 132nd Operations Group, 15 March 1992 \u2013 Present\n* [[124th Fighter Squadron]] 24 May 1946 \u2013 Present\n* [[174th Fighter Squadron]], 24 May 1946 \u2013 30 September 1962 (GSU Sioux City IA)\n* [[173d Air Refueling Squadron|173rd Fighter (later Fighter-Interceptor) Squadron]], 24 May 1946 \u2013 1 Jul 1960 (Nebraska ANG)\n\n===Stations===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Richmond International Airport|Richmond AAB]], [[Virginia]], 15 May 1943\n* [[Langley AFB|Langley Field]], [[Virginia]], 19 July 1943\n* [[Dover AFB|Dover AAFld]], [[Delaware]], ;

The 132nd's World War II predecessor unit, the ''365th Fighter Group'' was a [[IX Fighter Command]] unit, serving in the [[European Theater of Operations]]. The 365th, known as the \"Hell Hawks\", was one of the most successful [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighter groups of the [[Ninth Air Force]] when it came to air combat. The 365th was awarded two [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]s; Order of the Day, Belgium Army; Belgium Fourrag\u00e8re, and the Belgium Croix de Guerre. The 365th Fighter Group flew its last mission on 8 May 1945. After having operated manned fighter aircraft for all of its prior history, the wing was equipped with the [[MQ-9 Reaper]] unmanned aerial vehicle in 2013.\n\n==Units==\nThe units of the 132nd Wing include:\n* 132nd Operations Group \n** [[124th Fighter Squadron]] (F-16C/D) Tail Code: \"IA\"\n* 132nd Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Group\n** 232nd Intelligence Squadron\n** 233rd Intelligence Squadron\n* 132nd Mission Support Group\n* 132nd Medical Group\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n[[File:365thfg-beaulieu-1.jpg|thumb|left|Republic P-47D-28-RA Thunderbolt, AAF Ser. No. 42-28932 of the 388th Fighter Squadron.]]\nConstituted as the 365th Fighter Group on 27 April 1943. Activated on 15 May 1943. Trained with P-47's. Moved to [[RAF Gosfield]], England in December 1943. Assigned to [[Ninth Air Force]]. It was several weeks before the 365th received a full complement of 75 P-47D Thunderbolts and mid-February 1944 before they were placed on operational status. Their first mission, flown on 22 February, was a bomber support sweep of short duration over enemy-held territory.\n\nEarly missions were flown in support of Eighth Air Force [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] and [[B-24]] bomber operations and on one of these on 2 March, the 365th had its first encounter with [[Luftwaffe|enemy fighters]] in the [[Bastogne]] area, resulting in the loss of one Thunderbolt and claims of six of the enemy shot down. ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Egon Mayer]], one of the most successful [[Luftwaffe]] aces flying in the West with 102 victories, fell in this battle.\n\nOn 5 March, with only nine missions to its credit, the group moved south to [[RAF Beaulieu]] in Hampshire. The group was stood down three days after arrival so that it could undertake a two-week intensive course in ground attack and fighter-bombing. After training, the 365th flew dive-bombing missions to attack such targets as bridges, aerodromes, rail facilities, gun positions, and V-weapon sites prior to the invasion of the Continent.\n\nOn [[D-Day]], its duties were attacking gun emplacements and communications facilities behind the bridgehead. Two P-47s were lost. On the following day when 12 separate squadron-sized missions were flown five aircraft failed to return.\n\nAn unusual accident occurred on 9 June when two P-47s being delivered to Beaulieu by ferry pilots landed on different runways at the same time and collided at the runway intersection with one pilot being killed.\n\nThe 365th was one of the most successful P-47 groups of the Ninth Air Force when it came to air combat, and a total of 29 enemy aircraft were credited as shot down during the four months the group operated from Beaulieu. On 25 June, the 365th had one of its best days when eight enemy fighter-bombers were destroyed. On 2 July, Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Coffey, Jr., the Air Executive, became the Ninth Air Force's third Thunderbolt ace. As with other P-47 groups, losses were modest until ground attack became a regular task in June. All told, 24 P-47s were 'missing in action' during their stay at Beaulieu.\n\nThe 365th Group began its move to the Continent on 21 June, the first squadron taking up residence at Azeville, France (A-71) on 26 June, the last moving out of Beaulieu on 28 June and the rear party on 2 July providing tactical air support in support of [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]]. On the continent, the group moved rapidly from one airfield to another, eventually winding up near [[Fritzlar]], Germany (Y-86) on [[Victory in Europe Day|VE-Day]].\n\nAfter the end of hostilities, the 365th Fighter Group took part in the disarmament program until June, then returned to the United States in September 1945, being inactivated at Camp Myles Standish, near [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], Massachusetts on 22 September 1945.\n\n===Iowa Air National Guard===\n[[File:124th Fighter Squadron formation 1940s.jpg|thumb|132nd Fighter Wing formation in the 1940s]]\nThe redesignated group was formed with three fighter squadrons, consisting of the [[124th Fighter Squadron]] at Des Moines; the [[174th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Sioux City]], and the [[175th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]].  Engaged in routine training exercises, and was upgraded to [[F-84B Thunderjet]] jet aircraft in early 1948.\n\nThe [[United States Department of War|War Department]] authorized the establishment of [[Air National Guard]] units in all 48 states, with three units comprising a wing based in Sioux Falls, Sioux City and [[Des Moines, Iowa]].

The work included the addition of 1,800 feet to the main runway and 3,480 feet of taxiways to better accommodate the wing receiving jet aircraft upon their return to peacetime service. After returning to Des Moines, the wing was re-equipped with [[F-80C Shooting Star]] jet fighter-bombers and returned to normal peacetime training committed to [[Tactical Air Command]].  It was later upgraded with newer [[F-84E Thunderjet]]s in 1955.  The wing was transferred to [[Air Defense Command]] in July 1958, becoming an all-weather [[F-86L Sabre Interceptor]] squadron, its new mission being the air defense of Des Moines and eastern Iowa.\n\nIn June 1960, the Lincoln, Nebraska-based 173rd FIS was reassigned to the new Nebraska ANG [[155th Fighter-Interceptor Group]] when the squadron was expanded to a group-level organization.  In a similar reassignment, the Sioux City-based 174th FIS was reassigned to the [[185th Tactical Fighter Group]] on 30 September 1962.  The F-86Ls of the remaining 124th FIS were replaced  \nwith [[F-89J Scorpion]] Interceptors, which the squadron flew until the summer of 1969.\n[[File:124th Tactical Fighter Squadron - North American F-100F-10-NA Super Sabre 56-3880.jpg|thumb|124th TFS North American F-100F-10-NA Super Sabre, AF Ser. No. 56-3880, 1975]]\nThe 132nd was transferred back to TAC in 1969, being re-equipped with second-line [[F-84F Thunderstreak]]s, the standard TAC aircraft for its Air National Guard-gained squadrons at the time. The 132nd upgraded to the [[F-100D Super Sabre]] aircraft, which were returning from [[South Vietnam]] in 1971, and being transferred to the ANG to replace the subsonic F-84's. The wing began receiving new and transferred [[A-7D Corsair II]] ground attack aircraft in 1976 when the National Guard Bureau began modernizing the ANG with frontline aircraft after the drawdown of the regular Air Force following the end of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nWith the retirement of the A-7Ds in the late 1980s, the wing was upgraded to Block 42 [[F-16C Fighting Falcon]]s in 1990.  From 1998 to 2004, as part of the Air Expeditionary Force concept, the wing had an unprecedented six overseas contingency deployments to patrol the No-Fly Zone over Iraq in Operations Northern and Southern Watch. Two of the six contingency deployments occurred within a ten-month period, attesting to the unit's professionalism and high state of readiness.\n\n====Modern era====\n[[File:124th Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7K Corsair II 81-0077.jpg|thumb|left|124th TFS Ling-Temco-Vought A-7K Corsair II, AF Ser. No. 81-0077, about 1987]]\nImmediately following the events of 11 September 2001, the 124th Fighter Squadron's F-16s, pilots, and maintenance members were placed on alert, poised to defend Iowans and all Americans against any possible attacks. After 9/11 the unit's F-16's were prepared to launch within minutes in the event of a \"scramble\" order \u2013 24/7. The unit has also provided continuous Combat Air Patrols during Presidential visits.\n\nThe unit was deployed to Al Udeid AB, Qatar in 2005 in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The squadron performed in an exceptional manner, exhibiting an impressive array of capabilities. Outstanding leadership and superb aircraft maintenance skills produced 456 sorties and 3145 flying hours in austere conditions. Total flying hours during this contingency equaled to over three-fourths of a year's normal flying allocation in only 52 days.\n\nThe Wing was validated as the \"Best of the Best\" following its Operation Readiness Inspection in 2004, by Air Combat Command (ACC). Seventy-three percent of 154 rated areas were graded as ''Outstanding'' or ''Excellent''. The Excellent rating was received in each of the four major rated areas of ''Initial Response'', ''Employment'', ''Mission Support'', and ''Ability to Survive and Operate'', a precedent that had not been accomplished by a fighter wing in recent inspections. The 132nd Fighter Wing's rating was one of the highest achieved by an Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard wing in several years. In addition, the Logistics Readiness Squadron received the 2005 Air Reserve Component Base Logistics Activity of the Year Award and the Maintenance Group received the 2005 Air National Guard's Maintenance Effectiveness Award. As a result of its outstanding efforts and commitment to excellence, the Wing was awarded its seventh [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]].\n\nLess than a week after [[Hurricane Katrina]], 12 members of the 132nd Medical Group teamed up with 19 members of the Sioux City 185th Air Refueling Wing and headed south to bring aid to those injured or sick because of the storm. The team treated 80 to 100 patients a day with ailments ranging from minor cuts to dehydration and acute skin infections caused by exposure to bacteria-laden sewer water.\n\nThe 132nd Fighter Wing received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 2009. It was the eighth time the unit was the recipient of this prestigious award.\n\n====Mission Change====\nCongressional actions removed the wing's fighters from the base, with the transition beginning in FY 2013.<ref>http://www.kcci.com/news/central-iowa/Deal-would-pull-F-16s-from-Des-Moines/-/9357080/17829950/-/71eigyz/-/index.html</ref> The last regularly scheduled F-16 flights occurred in August 2013, after which the unit's 21 F-16s were transferred to the [[New Jersey Air National Guard]]'s [[177th Fighter Wing]] at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base]].<ref>http://www.radioiowa.com/2013/08/22/iowas-f-16s-bound-for-new-jersey/</ref>\n\nThe loss of the Falcons created some debate over the base's status as an aeronautical base with a true flying mission, and the airport threatened legal action to begin charging a full market-value lease. This was addressed by the reassignment of UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from Company C, 2nd Battalion, 147th Aviation, [[Iowa Army National Guard]], from Boone, IA to the base, occupying the hangars that held fixed-wing Air Force fighters for 70 years.<ref name=\"sfas\">[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/09/08/guard-move-helicopters-des-moines/71871928/ Guard: Move helicopters to Des Moines]</ref>\n\nBecause of the excellent work during its challenging mission change, the 132d Wing was selected for its 11th [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] in August 2016. As it brought all of its new missions to full operating capacity under budget and ahead of schedule, the Wing was awarded its 12th decoration of the award at the end of 2017.\n\n====Current Missions====\nThe wing moved from a manned fighter wing to a multi-mission unit, including the operation of [[Remotely Piloted Aircraft]], an [[Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance|ISR]] group, and a [[cyber operations]] squadron, adding them to the unit's distributed training operations center.\n\nThe '''132nd Operations Group''' operates the [[MQ-9 Reaper]], a remotely piloted aircraft. Aircrew based and physically located in Des Moines carry out missions in all corners of the world. These aircrews provide real-time full-motion video and flexible strike capabilities to combatant commanders around the globe.\n\nThe '''132nd ISR Group''' provides intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance research and analysis capabilities to enable combatant commanders' planning and operational decision making. Through the use of intelligence information and training, the analysts of this group determine the strengths and weaknesses of an enemy target complex and pass that information off to Weaponeers who determine the best aim point and weapon to achieve the desired target destruction. As part of the 25th Air Force, the 132 ISRG received the [[Air Force Meritorious Unit Award]] in late 2017 for participation in targeting operations worldwide.\n\nThe '''168th Cyberspace Operations Squadron''' is tasked with analyzing and protecting networks and systems by determining vulnerabilities and implementing solutions.\n\nThe '''Distributed Training Operations Center''' ('''DTOC''') is the [[Iowa Air National Guard]] center for [[Distributed Mission Operations]] (located in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]). It operates as a wing detachment. Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) is a component of the Air Force Training Transformation initiative. While the center organizes DMO events primarily for Air National Guard and [[Air Force Reserve Command]] [[aviator|pilot]]s, DTOC also facilitates training between Air National Guard fighter pilots and warfighters in the U.S. Army, Air Force Reserve, Navy, and allied forces.<ref name=\"overview\">{{cite web|title=ANG_Briefing Organizational Overview|url=http://proceedings.ndia.org/41A0/ANG_Briefing.pdf|website=proceedings.ndia.org|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> The center has also has the capability to include non-virtual assets into the simulation, allowing pilots in physical aircraft to participate in the exercises. Such virtual training exercises save the Air Force substantial funds over gathering assets for real-life exercises.\n\n===Lineage===\n[[File:365fg.png|thumb|175px|Legacy 365th Fighter Group emblem]]\n*Constituted as '''[[365th Fighter Group]]''' on 27 April 1943\n: Activated on 15 May 1943\n: Inactivated on 22 September 1945\n* Re-designated '''[[132nd Fighter Group]]''', and allotted to Iowa Air National Guard on 24 May 1946\n: Extended federal recognition on 23 Aug 1946\n: Ordered into active service on 1 April 1951\n: Re-designated '''[[132nd Fighter-Bomber Group]]''' 1 June 1951\n: Relieved from active service and returned, less personnel and equipment, to Iowa ANG, 1 January 1953\n: Re-designated: '''[[132nd Fighter-Interceptor Group]]''' on 1 Jul 1958\n: Re-designated: '''[[132nd Tactical Fighter Group]]''' on 2 Aug 1969\n: Status changed from Group to Wing, 15 Mar 1992\n: Re-designated: '''[[132nd Fighter Wing]]''' on 15 Mar 1992\n: Re-designated: '''132nd Wing''' on 7 Mar 2015\n\n===Assignments===\n* [[I Fighter Command]], 15 May 1943\n: Attached to: [[Philadelphia Fighter Wing]], 19 July \u2013 4 December 1943\n* [[70th Fighter Wing (World War II)|70th Fighter Wing]]\n: Attached to: [[IX Tactical Air Command|IX Air Service Command]], 22 December 1943\n* [[84th Fighter Wing (World War II)|84th Fighter Wing]]\n: Attached to: [[IX Tactical Air Command]], 1 August 1944\n* [[70th Fighter Wing (World War II)|70th Fighter Wing]]\n: Attached to: [[IX Tactical Air Command]], 1 October 1944\n* [[XIX Tactical Air Command]], 16 January 1945\n* [[IX Tactical Air Command]], 1 February \u2013 11 September 1945\n* [[Army Service Forces]] (for inactivation), 20\u201322 September 1945\n* [[71st Fighter Wing (Air National Guard)|71st Fighter Wing]], 23 August 1946\n* [[131st Composite Wing]], 1 November 1950\n* [[Iowa Air National Guard]], 1 March 1951\n: Gained by: [[Tactical Air Command]]\n* [[Strategic Air Command]], 1 April 1951\n* [[Tactical Air Command]], 1 November 1951\n* [[Iowa Air National Guard]], 1 January 1953\n: Gained by: [[Tactical Air Command]]\n: Gained by: [[Air Defense Command]], 1 July 1958\n: Gained by: [[Tactical Air Command]], 2 August 1969\n: Gained by: [[Air Combat Command]], 1 June 1992\n\n===Components===\n\n====World War II====\n* [[386th Fighter Squadron]] (D5), 15 May 1943 \u2013 22 September 1945\n* [[387th Fighter Squadron]] (B4), 15 May 1943 \u2013 22 September 1945\n* [[388th Fighter Squadron]] (C4), 15 May 1943 \u2013 22 September 1945\n\n====Iowa Air National Guard====\n* 132nd Operations Group, 15 March 1992 \u2013 Present\n* [[124th Fighter Squadron]] 24 May 1946 \u2013 Present\n* [[174th Fighter Squadron]], 24 May 1946 \u2013 30 September 1962 (GSU Sioux City IA)\n* [[173d Air Refueling Squadron|173rd Fighter (later Fighter-Interceptor) Squadron]], 24 May 1946 \u2013 1 Jul 1960 (Nebraska ANG)\n\n===Stations===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Richmond International Airport|Richmond AAB]], [[Virginia]], 15 May 1943\n* [[Langley AFB|Langley Field]], [[Virginia]], 19 July 1943\n* [[Dover AFB|Dover AAFld]], [[Delaware]], ;
