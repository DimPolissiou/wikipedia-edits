He was one of the persons primarily responsible for organizing the [[Holocaust]] in occupied Poland and numerous other [[crimes against humanity]]. He was arrested by the Americans in 1945, and was tried, convicted and executed by [[hanging]] in Poland in 1946.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGreiser was born in [[\u015aroda Wielkopolska|Schroda]] (\u015aroda Wielkopolska), [[Province of Posen]], [[Imperial Germany]], Greiser was the son of a minor local [[bailiff]] (''Gerichtsvollzieher''). He learned to speak [[Polish language|Polish]] fluently during his childhood. In 1903, he enrolled in elementary school, which was followed by two years of intermediate school and finally the K\u00f6niglich-Humanistisches Gymnasium (Royal Humanities Secondary School) in [[Inowroc\u0142aw|Hohensalza]], which he left in 1914 without receiving a diploma. In August 1914, he volunteered to join the [[Imperial German Navy]]. He served in the [[Kiel]] harbour naval forts at Korugen, Falckenstein, and in the fortress tower of [[Laboe]] from August 1914 to July 1915. He was then assigned as an artillery observer in [[Flanders]] as well as participating in [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]] operations in Friedrichsort. In April 1917, Greiser volunteered for service in the Naval [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte|Flying Corps]] where he initially served as an observer with SEE I and II and then with K\u00fcstenfliegerstaffel I and II. From August 1917 to August 1918, he was assigned as a naval aviator to Marine Schutzstaffel I. During this time, he was transferred to Seeflugstation Flandern II ([[Ostende]]) and he later flew with the Seefrontstaffel and MFJ IV. From December 1917 to January 1918, he was attached to the KE-Schule Langfuhr (near [[Danzig]], now [[Gda\u0144sk]]). Whilst posted to combat duty, he flew missions over the [[North Sea]] between the southern English and Belgian coasts. He was later shot down and wounded by gunfire. On 30 September 1919, he was classified as 50% war-disabled and discharged from naval service.\n\nHe earned the [[Iron Cross]] (First and Second Class), the [[Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918]] and a [[Wound Badge]] in Black in 1914. From 1919 to May 1921, he served in the [[Freikorps]] ''Grenzschutz Ost'' and fought in the [[Baltic states]].\n\n==Joining the Nazi Party==\nGreiser was fanatically anti-Christian{{sfn|Evans|2009|pp=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=WjoiVWGQ9HYC&pg=PT482&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Greiser&f=false 482ff]}} and an early member of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP number 166,635). After many years with the nationalist [[German Social Party (Weimar Republic)|Deutschsoziale Partei]] (DtSP) founded by [[Richard Kunze]] and membership in ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' in the mid-1920s, he joined the NSDAP and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] on 1 December 1929,{{sfn|Epstein|2012|p=45}} and the [[SS]] on 29 September 1931.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|p=52}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S19543, Arthur Greiser mit Gattin.jpg|thumb|Greiser as Senate President in 1936 with his wife]]\nHe was the Deputy President of the [[Free City of Danzig]] ([[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]]) from 1933 to 1934 in the [[Rauschning Senate]], and was made Senate President (Senatspr\u00e4sident) in 1935\u20131939, and the administrator (''Reichsstatthalter und Gauleiter'') of [[Reichsgau Wartheland]] (1939\u20131945). As Senate President of Danzig, he was a rival to his nominal superior [[Albert Forster]],{{fact|date=December 2015}} ''Gauleiter'' of the city since 1930. Greiser was part of the SS empire whilst Forster was closely aligned with the Nazi Party Mandarins [[Rudolf Hess]] and later [[Martin Bormann]].\n\nGreiser was directly responsible for escalating tensions between the Free City and the Republic of Poland in 1939. When the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] threatened economic reprisals following the harassment of Polish frontier guards and customs officers, Greiser issued an announcement on 29 July 1939 declaring that the Danzig police no longer recognised their authority or power, and demanded their immediate withdrawal. The notice was so rudely worded that the Polish diplomatic representative to Danzig, [[Marian Chodacki]], refused to forward it to Beck and instead sent a court summary.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1998-0109-502, Arthur Greiser in Posen.jpg|thumb|In occupied Pozna\u0144, 1939]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E12078, Posen, Amtseinf\u00fchrung Arthur Greiser.jpg|thumb|Reviewing the troops in Pozna\u0144, November 1939.  Greiser is on the right with [[Wilhelm Frick]] (center) and Generalmajor Walter Petzel (left).]]\nImmediately following the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]], Greiser was transferred from Danzig and appointed ''Chef der Zivilverwaltung im Milit\u00e4rbezirk Posen'' or Chief of Civil Administration in the military district of [[Province of Posen|Posen]], which was annexed to the German Reich on 8 September 1939. The military administration ended the following month, and he was then appointed ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (21 October) and  ''[[Reichsstatthalter]] f\u00fcr den [[Reichsgau Posen]]'' (26 October). On 29 January 1940, the region was renamed [[Reichsgau Wartheland]].\n\nThe territory was potentially very rich \u2013 the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] Imperial province of Posen had been the breadbasket of [[Wilhelmine]] Germany before 1914, possessed an excellent rail and road network, and a comparatively healthy and well educated workforce; [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a|Litzmanstadt]] (\u0141\u00f3d\u017a) had developed a fairly sophisticated industrial base during the 19th century. Although every ''Gauleiter'' was expected to fully Germanize his assigned area by any means,{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=251}} Greiser emphasized brutality to achieve this goal. He was an ardent [[racism|racist]] who enthusiastically pursued an '[[ethnic cleansing]]' program to rid the Warthegau of [[Poles]] and to resettle the 'cleansed' areas with ethnic Germans.{{sfn|Rees|1997|pp=143\u20135}} This was along the lines of the racial theories espoused by ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Mass expulsions of Poles from the Warthegau to the [[General Government]] and summary executions were the norm. A Polish servant in Greiser's house described him as \"a powerfully built figure. He was a tall man, you could see his arrogance, his conceit. He was so vain, so full of himself\u2014as if there was nothing above him, a god, almost. Everybody tried to get out of his way, people had to bow to him, salute him. And the Poles, he treated them with great contempt. For him the Poles were slaves, good for nothing but work\".{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=142}} Greiser himself stated his beliefs: \"If, in past times, other peoples enjoyed their century-long history by living well, and doing so by getting foreign peoples to work for them without compensating them accordingly and without meting out justice to them, then we too, as Germans want to learn from this history. No longer must we stand in the wings; on the contrary, we must altogether become a master race!\".{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=145}}\n\nIn addition to mass deportation, Greiser's district was also at the forefront of \"internal\" racial cleansing according to Nazi ideals. His subordinate [[Wilhelm Koppe]] provided the '[[Herbert Lange|Special Detachment (''Sonderkommando'') Lange]]' to the nearby [[Gau (administrative division)|Gau]] of [[East Prussia]] during May and June 1940. This SS squad gassed 1558 patients from mental asylums at the [[Soldau concentration camp]] and then returned to his region to continue this process.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=261}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J09397, Lodz, Millionster Umsiedler im Wartheland.jpg|thumb|Arthur Greiser in March 1944 welcoming the one-millionth [[Volksdeutsche]]r resettled from East Europe to occupied Poland as part of the \"[[Heim ins Reich]]\" campaign.]]\n\nGreiser was involved in the resettlement of German [[refugees]] from lands annexed to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939 and 1940. Between October and December 1939, nearly 60,000 ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' (ethnic Germans) arrived in Germany from the [[Baltic states]] of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. Evidently [[Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt]] (later employed as translator for General [[Andrey Vlasov]]) was in this group, as he \"resettled\" in [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]]. Neighbouring ''[[Gauleiter]]'' and rival [[Albert Forster]] refused them entry, and they were largely settled in properties seized from Poles in [[Pozna\u0144]] and across the [[Wartheland]]. However even Greiser was wary, noting that many were elderly and urbanized aristocrats with a strong class consciousness, not the virile peasant warrior types idolized by the SS. Closer to his heart were the over 100,000 ethnic Germans who were evacuated from [[Volhynia]] and eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. These were mostly farmers and rural people, and, learning from the Baltic experience, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in eastern Wartheland was designated the main [[Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]] (VoMi) reception centre. In May 1940 a further 30,000 [[Volksdeutsche]] were relocated from the [[Nazi]] General Government of Poland to Greiser's domain. After 1941 a further 300,000 ethnic Germans were evacuated from Russia and [[Ukraine]] to Wartheland during the German invasion and occupation of the Soviet Union. Greiser's Pozna\u0144 was considered the Germanised city par excellence, and on 3 August 1943 he hosted a national gathering of ''Gauleiter'' and senior Nazis, including [[Martin Bormann]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Heinrich Himmler.\n\n===Anti-Church campaign===\n[[Richard J. Evans]] wrote that the Catholic Church was the institution that, \"more than any other had sustained Polish national identity over the centuries\".{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=34}} The Nazi plan for Poland entailed the destruction of the Polish nation. This necessarily required attacking the Polish Church, particularly in those areas annexed to Germany.<ref>Jozef Garlinski; ''Poland and the Second World War''; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 60</ref> Greiser, with the encouragement of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and Martin Bormann, launched a severe attack on the Catholic Church. He cut off support to the Church from the state and from outside influences such as the Vatican and Germany. In July 1940 he instituted Bormann's anti-church \"thirteen point\" measures in the territory.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|p=224}} The anti-church measures, which had Hitler's approval, suggest how the Nazis aimed to \u00ab'de-church' German society\u00bb.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|pp=225\u20138}}\n\nCatholic Church properties and funds were confiscated, and lay organisations shut down. Evans wrote that \"Numerous clergy, monks, diocesan administrators and officials of the Church were arrested, deported to the General Government, taken off to a concentration camp in the Reich, or simply shot. Altogether some 1700 Polish priests ended up at Dachau: half of them did not survive their imprisonment.\" Greiser's administrative chief [[August Jager]] had earlier led the effort at Nazification of the Evangelical Church in Prussia.{{sfn|Evans|2009|pp=33\u20134}} In Poland, he earned the nickname \"''Kirchenj\u00e4ger''\" (Church Hunter) for the vehemence of his hostility to the Church.<ref>[[Mark Mazower]]; ''Hitler's Empire \u2013 Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe''; Penguin; 2008; {{ISBN|978-0-713-99681-4}}; p. 92.</ref> \"By the end of 1941\", wrote Evans, \"the Polish Catholic Church had been effectively outlawed in the Wartheland. It was more or less Germanized in the other occupied territories, despite an encyclical issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] as early as 27 October 1939 protesting against this persecution.\"{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=34}}\n\n===Holocaust===\nSS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' Greiser actively participated in the [[Holocaust]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Model Nazi: Arthur Greiser and the Occupation of Western Poland|last=Epstein|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199646531|location=|pages=231-232}}</ref>Early in 1940, Greiser is on record challenging [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] over efforts to delay the expulsion of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Jews to Poland. On 18 September 1941, ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' Himmler informed Greiser that he intended to transfer 60,000 [[Czechs|Czech]] and German Jews to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [[ghetto]] until spring 1942, when they would be \"resettled\". The first transport arrived a few weeks later, and Greiser sought and received permission from Himmler to kill 100,000 Jews in his area.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=484}} He then instructed [[HSSPF]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] to manage the overcrowding. Koppe and SS-''[[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Herbert Lange]] proceeded to manage the problem by experimenting at a country estate at [[Che\u0142mno nad Nerem]] with [[gas vans]], establishing the first extermination unit which ultimately carried out the mass murder of approximately 150,000 Jews between late 1941 and April 1942. Furthermore, on 6 October 1943 Greiser hosted a national assembly of senior SS officers in [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] at which Himmler candidly spoke of the mass executions of civilians (the infamous [[Posen Speech]]). Greiser's [[mass murder]] operations were coordinated by SS-''[[Oberf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Herbert Mehlhorn]].<ref name=\"GrunerOsterloh2015\">{{cite book|author1=Wolf Gruner|author2=Jorg Osterloh|title=The Greater German Reich and the Jews: Nazi Persecution Policies in the Annexed Territories 1935\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5R6jBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA205|date=15 January 2015|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-444-1|page=205|quote=Wartheland's Security Police and SS-Oberf\u00fchrer Herbert Mehlhorn, who was ordered by Greiser to coordinate the mass murder operations, resorted to gas wagons, which had already ...}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1945, Greiser ordered a general evacuation of Posen (having received a telegram from Bormann relaying Hitler's order to leave the city). Greiser left the city the same evening and reported to Himmler's personal train in Frankfurt am Oder. There Greiser found that he had been tricked by Bormann. Hitler had announced that Posen must be held at all costs, and Greiser was now viewed as a deserter and coward, particularly by Goebbels, who in his diary on 2 March 1945 labeled Greiser \"a real disgrace to the ([[Nazism|Nazi]]) Party\", but his recommendations for punishment after the capture of Pozna\u0144 were ignored.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=759n24}}\n\nHe surrendered to the [[United States|Americans]] in Austria with SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Heinz Reinefarth]] in 1945.\n\n==Trial and execution==\nAfter the war, the Polish government (the [[Supreme National Tribunal]]) tried Greiser for [[war crime]]s. His defence that he was only following orders did not hold up as it was shown that other ''Gauleiter''s had not followed a similar policy. For example, Albert Forster, ''Gauleiter'' of [[Danzig-West Prussia]] (the other German-annexed section of occupied Poland), simply declared all Poles in his area who were reasonably proficient in German to be Germans (although he was guilty of the elimination of the Jewish population under his jurisdiction either by murder or deportation). Greiser's advocates, Stanis\u0142aw Hejmowski and Jan Kr\u0119glewski, tried to convince the Tribunal that Greiser, as a head of formally independent state, the [[Free City of Danzig]], could not be judged by another country, an argument rejected by the court. Greiser was convicted of the following:\n*[[genocide]] and the murder of civilians and [[POW]]s;\n*torture, persecution, and injuring civilians and [[POW]]s;\n*organized and systematic destruction of Polish culture, plunder of Polish cultural heritage, [[Germanisation]] of the country and the Polish people, illegal appropriation of public property;\n*organised and systematic looting of Polish property;\n*insulting and deriding the Polish nation by propagating the idea of its cultural inferiority and low social worth;\n*forcibly expelling individuals, families, neighbourhoods and whole districts to the [[General Government]] or [[Arbeitslager|forced labour camps]] in the German Reich;\n*persecution and murder of Polish Jews by killing them in their places of residence, grouping them in closed [[ghetto]]s from which they were sent to the [[Chelmno extermination camp]] for extermination in [[gas chamber]]s, deriding the Jewish people in actions and words, causing physical suffering, injury and humiliation of human dignity;\n*[[Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany|taking Polish children against the will of their parents or guardians]], forcibly putting them in German families or public orphanages within the Reich while severing all contacts with their families and nation by giving them German names.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that Greiser was guilty of all charges and sentenced him to death by hanging, [[civil death]], and confiscation of all his property. In the early morning of 21 July 1946 he was transported from prison to the slope of [[Fort Winiary]] where he was [[hanging|hanged]] before a large crowd, despite a plea from Pope [[Pius XII]] that his life be spared.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|pp=334\u20135}}<ref>{{youtube|dTAOqG_i3cs|Execution of Arthur Greiser}}</ref> It was the last public [[execution in Poland]] and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bart\u0142omiej Koz\u0142owski |date=14 July 1946 |title=Powieszenie Arthura Greisera, gauleitera Kraju Warty ostatnia publiczna egzekucja w Polsce  |website=Polska.pl |language=pl |url=http://wiadomosci.polska.pl/kalendarz/kalendarium/article.htm?id%3D223986 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714221959/http://wiadomosci.polska.pl/kalendarz/kalendarium/article.htm?id=223986 |archivedate=14 July 2006 |accessdate=23 November 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[[Register of SS-Leaders in general\u2019s rank#List SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer|List SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland]]\n*[[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Ailsby, Christopher (1997).

He was one of the persons primarily responsible for organizing the [[Holocaust]] in occupied Poland and numerous other [[crimes against humanity]]. He was arrested by the Americans in 1945, and was tried, convicted and executed by [[hanging]] in Poland in 1946.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGreiser was born in [[\u015aroda Wielkopolska|Schroda]] (\u015aroda Wielkopolska), [[Province of Posen]], [[Imperial Germany]], Greiser was the son of a minor local [[bailiff]] (''Gerichtsvollzieher''). He learned to speak [[Polish language|Polish]] fluently during his childhood. In 1903, he enrolled in elementary school, which was followed by two years of intermediate school and finally the K\u00f6niglich-Humanistisches Gymnasium (Royal Humanities Secondary School) in [[Inowroc\u0142aw|Hohensalza]], which he left in 1914 without receiving a diploma. In August 1914, he volunteered to join the [[Imperial German Navy]]. He served in the [[Kiel]] harbour naval forts at Korugen, Falckenstein, and in the fortress tower of [[Laboe]] from August 1914 to July 1915. He was then assigned as an artillery observer in [[Flanders]] as well as participating in [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]] operations in Friedrichsort. In April 1917, Greiser volunteered for service in the Naval [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte|Flying Corps]] where he initially served as an observer with SEE I and II and then with K\u00fcstenfliegerstaffel I and II. From August 1917 to August 1918, he was assigned as a naval aviator to Marine Schutzstaffel I. During this time, he was transferred to Seeflugstation Flandern II ([[Ostende]]) and he later flew with the Seefrontstaffel and MFJ IV. From December 1917 to January 1918, he was attached to the KE-Schule Langfuhr (near [[Danzig]], now [[Gda\u0144sk]]). Whilst posted to combat duty, he flew missions over the [[North Sea]] between the southern English and Belgian coasts. He was later shot down and wounded by gunfire. On 30 September 1919, he was classified as 50% war-disabled and discharged from naval service.\n\nHe earned the [[Iron Cross]] (First and Second Class), the [[Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918]] and a [[Wound Badge]] in Black in 1914. From 1919 to May 1921, he served in the [[Freikorps]] ''Grenzschutz Ost'' and fought in the [[Baltic states]].\n\n==Joining the Nazi Party==\nGreiser was fanatically anti-Christian{{sfn|Evans|2009|pp=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=WjoiVWGQ9HYC&pg=PT482&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Greiser&f=false 482ff]}} and an early member of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP number 166,635). After many years with the nationalist [[German Social Party (Weimar Republic)|Deutschsoziale Partei]] (DtSP) founded by [[Richard Kunze]] and membership in ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' in the mid-1920s, he joined the NSDAP and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] on 1 December 1929,{{sfn|Epstein|2012|p=45}} and the [[SS]] on 29 September 1931.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|p=52}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S19543, Arthur Greiser mit Gattin.jpg|thumb|Greiser as Senate President in 1936 with his wife]]\nHe was the Deputy President of the [[Free City of Danzig]] ([[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]]) from 1933 to 1934 in the [[Rauschning Senate]], and was made Senate President (Senatspr\u00e4sident) in 1935\u20131939, and the administrator (''Reichsstatthalter und Gauleiter'') of [[Reichsgau Wartheland]] (1939\u20131945). As Senate President of Danzig, he was a rival to his nominal superior [[Albert Forster]],{{fact|date=December 2015}} ''Gauleiter'' of the city since 1930. Greiser was part of the SS empire whilst Forster was closely aligned with the Nazi Party Mandarins [[Rudolf Hess]] and later [[Martin Bormann]].\n\nGreiser was directly responsible for escalating tensions between the Free City and the Republic of Poland in 1939. When the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] threatened economic reprisals following the harassment of Polish frontier guards and customs officers, Greiser issued an announcement on 29 July 1939 declaring that the Danzig police no longer recognised their authority or power, and demanded their immediate withdrawal. The notice was so rudely worded that the Polish diplomatic representative to Danzig, [[Marian Chodacki]], refused to forward it to Beck and instead sent a court summary.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1998-0109-502, Arthur Greiser in Posen.jpg|thumb|In occupied Pozna\u0144, 1939]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E12078, Posen, Amtseinf\u00fchrung Arthur Greiser.jpg|thumb|Reviewing the troops in Pozna\u0144, November 1939.  Greiser is on the right with [[Wilhelm Frick]] (center) and Generalmajor Walter Petzel (left).]]\nImmediately following the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]], Greiser was transferred from Danzig and appointed ''Chef der Zivilverwaltung im Milit\u00e4rbezirk Posen'' or Chief of Civil Administration in the military district of [[Province of Posen|Posen]], which was annexed to the German Reich on 8 September 1939. The military administration ended the following month, and he was then appointed ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (21 October) and  ''[[Reichsstatthalter]] f\u00fcr den [[Reichsgau Posen]]'' (26 October). On 29 January 1940, the region was renamed [[Reichsgau Wartheland]].\n\nThe territory was potentially very rich \u2013 the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] Imperial province of Posen had been the breadbasket of [[Wilhelmine]] Germany before 1914, possessed an excellent rail and road network, and a comparatively healthy and well educated workforce; [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a|Litzmanstadt]] (\u0141\u00f3d\u017a) had developed a fairly sophisticated industrial base during the 19th century. Although every ''Gauleiter'' was expected to fully Germanize his assigned area by any means,{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=251}} Greiser emphasized brutality to achieve this goal. He was an ardent [[racism|racist]] who enthusiastically pursued an '[[ethnic cleansing]]' program to rid the Warthegau of [[Poles]] and to resettle the 'cleansed' areas with ethnic Germans.{{sfn|Rees|1997|pp=143\u20135}} This was along the lines of the racial theories espoused by ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Mass expulsions of Poles from the Warthegau to the [[General Government]] and summary executions were the norm. A Polish servant in Greiser's house described him as \"a powerfully built figure. He was a tall man, you could see his arrogance, his conceit. He was so vain, so full of himself\u2014as if there was nothing above him, a god, almost. Everybody tried to get out of his way, people had to bow to him, salute him. And the Poles, he treated them with great contempt. For him the Poles were slaves, good for nothing but work\".{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=142}} Greiser himself stated his beliefs: \"If, in past times, other peoples enjoyed their century-long history by living well, and doing so by getting foreign peoples to work for them without compensating them accordingly and without meting out justice to them, then we too, as Germans want to learn from this history. No longer must we stand in the wings; on the contrary, we must altogether become a master race!\".{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=145}}\n\nIn addition to mass deportation, Greiser's district was also at the forefront of \"internal\" racial cleansing according to Nazi ideals. His subordinate [[Wilhelm Koppe]] provided the '[[Herbert Lange|Special Detachment (''Sonderkommando'') Lange]]' to the nearby [[Gau (administrative division)|Gau]] of [[East Prussia]] during May and June 1940. This SS squad gassed 1558 patients from mental asylums at the [[Soldau concentration camp]] and then returned to his region to continue this process.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=261}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J09397, Lodz, Millionster Umsiedler im Wartheland.jpg|thumb|Arthur Greiser in March 1944 welcoming the one-millionth [[Volksdeutsche]]r resettled from East Europe to occupied Poland as part of the \"[[Heim ins Reich]]\" campaign.]]\n\nGreiser was involved in the resettlement of German [[refugees]] from lands annexed to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939 and 1940. Between October and December 1939, nearly 60,000 ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' (ethnic Germans) arrived in Germany from the [[Baltic states]] of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. Evidently [[Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt]] (later employed as translator for General [[Andrey Vlasov]]) was in this group, as he \"resettled\" in [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]]. Neighbouring ''[[Gauleiter]]'' and rival [[Albert Forster]] refused them entry, and they were largely settled in properties seized from Poles in [[Pozna\u0144]] and across the [[Wartheland]]. However even Greiser was wary, noting that many were elderly and urbanized aristocrats with a strong class consciousness, not the virile peasant warrior types idolized by the SS. Closer to his heart were the over 100,000 ethnic Germans who were evacuated from [[Volhynia]] and eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. These were mostly farmers and rural people, and, learning from the Baltic experience, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in eastern Wartheland was designated the main [[Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]] (VoMi) reception centre. In May 1940 a further 30,000 [[Volksdeutsche]] were relocated from the [[Nazi]] General Government of Poland to Greiser's domain. After 1941 a further 300,000 ethnic Germans were evacuated from Russia and [[Ukraine]] to Wartheland during the German invasion and occupation of the Soviet Union. Greiser's Pozna\u0144 was considered the Germanised city par excellence, and on 3 August 1943 he hosted a national gathering of ''Gauleiter'' and senior Nazis, including [[Martin Bormann]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Heinrich Himmler.\n\n===Anti-Church campaign===\n[[Richard J. Evans]] wrote that the Catholic Church was the institution that, \"more than any other had sustained Polish national identity over the centuries\".{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=34}} The Nazi plan for Poland entailed the destruction of the Polish nation. This necessarily required attacking the Polish Church, particularly in those areas annexed to Germany.<ref>Jozef Garlinski; ''Poland and the Second World War''; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 60</ref> Greiser, with the encouragement of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and Martin Bormann, launched a severe attack on the Catholic Church. He cut off support to the Church from the state and from outside influences such as the Vatican and Germany. In July 1940 he instituted Bormann's anti-church \"thirteen point\" measures in the territory.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|p=224}} The anti-church measures, which had Hitler's approval, suggest how the Nazis aimed to \u00ab'de-church' German society\u00bb.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|pp=225\u20138}}\n\nCatholic Church properties and funds were confiscated, and lay organisations shut down. Evans wrote that \"Numerous clergy, monks, diocesan administrators and officials of the Church were arrested, deported to the General Government, taken off to a concentration camp in the Reich, or simply shot. Altogether some 1700 Polish priests ended up at Dachau: half of them did not survive their imprisonment.\" Greiser's administrative chief [[August Jager]] had earlier led the effort at Nazification of the Evangelical Church in Prussia.{{sfn|Evans|2009|pp=33\u20134}} In Poland, he earned the nickname \"''Kirchenj\u00e4ger''\" (Church Hunter) for the vehemence of his hostility to the Church.<ref>[[Mark Mazower]]; ''Hitler's Empire \u2013 Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe''; Penguin; 2008; {{ISBN|978-0-713-99681-4}}; p. 92.</ref> \"By the end of 1941\", wrote Evans, \"the Polish Catholic Church had been effectively outlawed in the Wartheland. It was more or less Germanized in the other occupied territories, despite an encyclical issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] as early as 27 October 1939 protesting against this persecution.\"{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=34}}\n\n===Holocaust===\nSS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' Greiser actively participated in the [[Holocaust]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Model Nazi: Arthur Greiser and the Occupation of Western Poland|last=Epstein|first=Catherine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199646531|location=|pages=231-232}}</ref>Early in 1940, Greiser is on record challenging [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] over efforts to delay the expulsion of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Jews to Poland. On 18 September 1941, ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' Himmler informed Greiser that he intended to transfer 60,000 [[Czechs|Czech]] and German Jews to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [[ghetto]] until spring 1942, when they would be \"resettled\". The first transport arrived a few weeks later, and Greiser sought and received permission from Himmler to kill 100,000 Jews in his area.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=484}} He then instructed [[HSSPF]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] to manage the overcrowding. Koppe and SS-''[[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Herbert Lange]] proceeded to manage the problem by experimenting at a country estate at [[Che\u0142mno nad Nerem]] with [[gas vans]], establishing the first extermination unit which ultimately carried out the mass murder of approximately 150,000 Jews between late 1941 and April 1942. Furthermore, on 6 October 1943 Greiser hosted a national assembly of senior SS officers in [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] at which Himmler candidly spoke of the mass executions of civilians (the infamous [[Posen Speech]]). Greiser's [[mass murder]] operations were coordinated by SS-''[[Oberf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Herbert Mehlhorn]].<ref name=\"GrunerOsterloh2015\">{{cite book|author1=Wolf Gruner|author2=Jorg Osterloh|title=The Greater German Reich and the Jews: Nazi Persecution Policies in the Annexed Territories 1935\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5R6jBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA205|date=15 January 2015|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-444-1|page=205|quote=Wartheland's Security Police and SS-Oberf\u00fchrer Herbert Mehlhorn, who was ordered by Greiser to coordinate the mass murder operations, resorted to gas wagons, which had already ...}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1945, Greiser ordered a general evacuation of Posen (having received a telegram from Bormann relaying Hitler's order to leave the city). Greiser left the city the same evening and reported to Himmler's personal train in Frankfurt am Oder. There Greiser found that he had been tricked by Bormann. Hitler had announced that Posen must be held at all costs, and Greiser was now viewed as a deserter and coward, particularly by Goebbels, who in his diary on 2 March 1945 labeled Greiser \"a real disgrace to the ([[Nazism|Nazi]]) Party\", but his recommendations for punishment after the capture of Pozna\u0144 were ignored.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=759n24}}\n\nHe surrendered to the [[United States|Americans]] in Austria with SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Heinz Reinefarth]] in 1945.\n\n==Trial and execution==\nAfter the war, the Polish government (the [[Supreme National Tribunal]]) tried Greiser for [[war crime]]s. His defence that he was only following orders did not hold up as it was shown that other ''Gauleiter''s had not followed a similar policy. For example, Albert Forster, ''Gauleiter'' of [[Danzig-West Prussia]] (the other German-annexed section of occupied Poland), simply declared all Poles in his area who were reasonably proficient in German to be Germans (although he was guilty of the elimination of the Jewish population under his jurisdiction either by murder or deportation). Greiser's advocates, Stanis\u0142aw Hejmowski and Jan Kr\u0119glewski, tried to convince the Tribunal that Greiser, as a head of formally independent state, the [[Free City of Danzig]], could not be judged by another country, an argument rejected by the court. Greiser was convicted of:\n*[[genocide]] and the murder of civilians and [[POW]]s;\n*torture, persecution, and injuring civilians and [[POW]]s;\n*organized and systematic destruction of Polish culture, plunder of Polish cultural heritage, [[Germanisation]] of the country and the Polish people, illegal appropriation of public property;\n*organised and systematic looting of Polish property;\n*insulting and deriding the Polish nation by propagating the idea of its cultural inferiority and low social worth;\n*forcibly expelling individuals, families, neighbourhoods and whole districts to the [[General Government]] or [[Arbeitslager|forced labour camps]] in the German Reich;\n*persecution and murder of Polish Jews by killing them in their places of residence, grouping them in closed [[ghetto]]s from which they were sent to the [[Chelmno extermination camp]] for extermination in [[gas chamber]]s, deriding the Jewish people in actions and words, causing physical suffering, injury and humiliation of human dignity;\n*[[Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany|taking Polish children against the will of their parents or guardians]], forcibly putting them in German families or public orphanages within the Reich while severing all contacts with their families and nation by giving them German names.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that Greiser was guilty of all charges and sentenced him to death by hanging, [[civil death]], and confiscation of all his property. In the early morning of 21 July 1946 he was transported from prison to the slope of [[Fort Winiary]] where he was [[hanging|hanged]] before a large crowd, despite a plea from Pope [[Pius XII]] that his life be spared.{{sfn|Epstein|2012|pp=334\u20135}}<ref>{{youtube|dTAOqG_i3cs|Execution of Arthur Greiser}}</ref> It was the last public [[execution in Poland]] and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bart\u0142omiej Koz\u0142owski |date=14 July 1946 |title=Powieszenie Arthura Greisera, gauleitera Kraju Warty ostatnia publiczna egzekucja w Polsce  |website=Polska.pl |language=pl |url=http://wiadomosci.polska.pl/kalendarz/kalendarium/article.htm?id%3D223986 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714221959/http://wiadomosci.polska.pl/kalendarz/kalendarium/article.htm?id=223986 |archivedate=14 July 2006 |accessdate=23 November 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[[Register of SS-Leaders in general\u2019s rank#List SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer|List SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland]]\n*[[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Ailsby, Christopher (1997).
