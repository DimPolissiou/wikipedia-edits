The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]].

North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song, which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours, such as singing, to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side-effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species),<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref> and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=PowleslandA>{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.|year=1997|title=Protocols for monitoring New Zealand robins: Petroica australis|series=Department of Conservation Technical Series|volume=13|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation}}</ref> However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]].

He began the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in 43, and became the first [[List of Roman governors of Britain|governor]] of the new province, serving from 43 to 46.\n\n==Career==\nLittle is known of Aulus Plautius's early career. It was previously believed that he was involved in the suppression of a slave revolt in [[Apulia]], which possibly happened in AD 24, alongside [[Marcus Aelius Celer]].<ref>{{CIL|9|2335}} = ILS&nbsp;961</ref> However, the \"A\u00b7PLAVTIO\" of the inscription is now identified as Aulus' father of the same name, [[Aulus Plautius (suffect consul 1 BC)|Aulus Plautius]].<ref>Birley, ''Roman Government'', p.&nbsp;21</ref> The younger Plautius was [[suffect]] [[consul]] for the second half of 29, with [[Lucius Nonius Asprenas (suffect consul 29)|Lucius Nonius Asprenas]] as his colleague.<ref>[[Attilio Degrassi]], ''I fasti consolari dell'Impero Romano dal 30 avanti Cristo al 613 dopo Cristo'' (Rome, 1952), p.&nbsp;9</ref> Subsequently he held a provincial governorship, probably of [[Pannonia]], in the early years of [[Claudius]]'s reign; another inscription shows he oversaw the building of a road between [[Trieste]] and [[Rijeka]] at that time.<ref>{{CIL|5|698}} = ILS&nbsp;5889</ref> [[Anthony Birley]] suspects Plautius also played a role in suppressing the coup by [[Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus]] in 42.<ref name=Birley-39>Birley, ''Fasti of Roman Britain'', p.&nbsp;39</ref>\n\nClaudius appointed Plautius to lead his invasion of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] in 43. The ''causus belli'' was to restore [[Verica]], king of the [[Atrebates]] and an ally of Rome, to the throne; he had been deposed by his eastern neighbours, the [[Catuvellauni]]. Birley argues that Plautius was selected not only out of gratitude for his loyalty the previous year, but for his established familial connections to Claudius and the Imperial family.<ref name=Birley-39/>\n\nThe invasion force consisted of four [[Roman legion|legions]]: [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']], then in Pannonia; [[Legio II Augusta|II ''Augusta'']]; [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV ''Gemina'']]; and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], plus about 20,000 auxiliary troops, including [[Thrace|Thracians]] and [[Batavians]]. Legio II ''Augusta'' was commanded by the future emperor [[Vespasian]]. Three other men of appropriate rank to command legions are known to have been involved in the invasion: Vespasian's brother, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], and [[Gnaeus Hosidius Geta]] appear in [[Dio Cassius]]'s account of the invasion; [[Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus (consul 41)|Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus]] is mentioned by [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], although as a former consul he may have been too senior, and perhaps accompanied Claudius later.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]], ''[[Historia Romana]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60:19\u201322]; [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'': [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 ''Vespasian'' 4]; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans7.html#13 7:13]</ref>\n\nOn the beaches of northern [[Gaul]] Plautius faced a mutiny by his troops, who were reluctant to cross the [[Oceanus|Ocean]] and fight beyond the limits of the known world. They were persuaded after Claudius's [[freedman]] and secretary [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] addressed them. Seeing a former slave in place of their commander, they cried \"''Io Saturnalia!''\" ([[Saturnalia]] being a Roman festival in which social roles were reversed for the day) and the mutiny was over.\n\nThe invasion force is generally believed to have landed at [[Richborough]] in [[Kent]], although elements may have landed elsewhere (see [[Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain]]). The Britons, led by [[Togodumnus]] and [[Caratacus]] of the Catuvellauni, were reluctant to fight a pitched battle, relying instead on [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]]. However, Plautius defeated first Caratacus on the [[River Medway]], then Togodumnus on the [[River Thames]]. Togodumnus died shortly afterwards, although Caratacus survived and continued to be a thorn in the invaders' side.\n\nHaving reached the Thames River, Plautius halted and sent for Claudius, who arrived with elephants and heavy artillery and completed the march on the Catuvellaunian capital, Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]). Claudius claimed in a triumphal inscription that he accepted the surrender of 11 British kings at Camulodunum.

The ''causus belli'' was to restore [[Verica]], king of the [[Atrebates]] and an ally of Rome, to the throne; he had been deposed by his eastern neighbours, the [[Catuvellauni]]. Birley argues that Plautius was selected not only out of gratitude for his loyalty the previous year, but for his established familial connections to Claudius and the Imperial family.<ref name=Birley-39/>\n\nThe invasion force consisted of four [[Roman legion|legions]]: [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']], then in Pannonia; [[Legio II Augusta|II ''Augusta'']]; [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV ''Gemina'']]; and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], plus about 20,000 auxiliary troops, including [[Thrace|Thracians]] and [[Batavians]]. Legio II ''Augusta'' was commanded by the future emperor [[Vespasian]]. Three other men of appropriate rank to command legions are known to have been involved in the invasion: Vespasian's brother, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], and [[Gnaeus Hosidius Geta]] appear in [[Dio Cassius]]'s account of the invasion; [[Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus (consul 41)|Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus]] is mentioned by [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], although as a former consul he may have been too senior, and perhaps accompanied Claudius later.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]], ''[[Historia Romana]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60:19\u201322]; [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'': [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 ''Vespasian'' 4]; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans7.html#13 7:13]</ref>\n\nOn the beaches of northern [[Gaul]] Plautius faced a mutiny by his troops, who were reluctant to cross the [[Oceanus|Ocean]] and fight beyond the limits of the known world. They were persuaded after Claudius's [[freedman]] and secretary [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] addressed them. Seeing a former slave in place of their commander, they cried \"''Io Saturnalia!''\" ([[Saturnalia]] being a Roman festival in which social roles were reversed for the day) and the mutiny was over.\n\nThe invasion force is generally believed to have landed at [[Richborough]] in [[Kent]], although elements may have landed elsewhere (see [[Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain]]). The Britons, led by [[Togodumnus]] and [[Caratacus]] of the Catuvellauni, were reluctant to fight a pitched battle, relying instead on [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]]. However, Plautius defeated first Caratacus on the [[River Medway]], then Togodumnus on the [[River Thames]]. Togodumnus died shortly afterwards, although Caratacus survived and continued to be a thorn in the invaders' side.\n\nHaving reached the Thames River, Plautius halted and sent for Claudius, who arrived with elephants and heavy artillery and completed the march on the Catuvellaunian capital, Camulodunum ([[Colchester]]). Claudius claimed in a triumphal inscription that he accepted the surrender of 11 British kings at Camulodunum. A [[Roman province]] was established from the conquered territory and Plautius was appointed its [[List of Roman governors of Britain|governor]].<ref>[[Sheppard Frere]], ''Britannia: A history of Roman Britain'', revised edition (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1978), p.&nbsp;82</ref>\n\n[[File:British.coinage.Roman.invasion.jpg|thumb|left|Conquests under Aulus Plautius, focused on the commercially valuable southeast of Britain.]]\nBeginning in the year following the successful conquest, the four legions that comprised the provincial garrison proceeded to extend the boundaries of the new province: Legio IX pushed north along the course of what became [[Ermine Street]] to construct a camp at what later became [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]; Legio XIV advanced into the Midlands along the course of [[Watling Street]], then turned north to set up its base at what later became [[Leicester]]; Legio II, under the command of [[Vespasian]], marched through the south reducing over 20 hill forts, conquering the [[Isle of Wight]], and subduing two powerful tribes, to eventually set up its own base most likely at [[Exeter]]; the fourth major unit, Legio XX, Plautius likely kept at Camulodunum with some auxiliaries as a reserve force.

which has historically operated in the [[northwestern United States]], but also currently includes four schools in areas not usually considered part of that region\u2014two in Alaska (neither of which is located in [[Southeast Alaska]], an area often considered part of the Northwest), one in eastern Montana (almost never considered part of the region), and one in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of British Columbia (an area included with the Northwest U.S. in the larger [[Pacific Northwest]] region).\n\nIt participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA)'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] level, and is the only NCAA conference in any division with a [[Canadian]] university as a member.\n\nThe conference was formed in 2001 when its original ten members split from the [[Pacific West Conference]].\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Member schools==\n\n===Current members===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained. The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase [[high-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]. The optically pure compound and intermediate '''a''' are reacted with trimethyl phosphate and methylimidazole to obtain a [[diastereomer]] mixture of remdesivir. In the end, optically pure remdesivir can be obtained through [[chiral resolution]] methods.\n\n==Access==\nOn 20 March 2020, President Trump announced that remdesivir was available for \"[[compassionate use]]\" by people with COVID-19; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn confirmed the statement at the same press conference.<!--Apologies, but the following definition does not capture the definition provided at the corresponding Wikipedia article on the subject, and so creates unnecessary contradiction.

It is the early 20th century when India remains part of the British empire. The opening sequence shows a group of British soldiers plundering an Indian fort and taking its riches by air to England. They are stopped by the valiant Raja Azad Singh ([[Dara Singh]]), who is immensely strong and manages to lasso the light aircraft, subdue several English soldiers and recover the stolen jewels. Around this time, Raja Azad Singh's wife Rani Durga ([[Nirupa Roy]]) gives birth to a baby boy, who is named Raju. Raja carves the word ''mard'' (man, intending to convey strength and bravery) into the newborn's chest, noting proudly that the baby is smiling throughout, and can apparently feel no pain. (His words, ''mard ko dard nahin hota'', meaning \"a true man feels no pain\", are a recurring dialogue throughout the movie.) The British commission conducts an investigation, led by a sympathetic and liberal Englishwoman, Lady Helena; the investigation uncovers the atrocities of the English troops and results in several officers being officially reprimanded. Lady Helena is a close confidante of Raja Azad Singh and is generally supportive of Raja and the idea of India gaining independence from British rule.\n\nThe English officers General Dyer ([[Kamal Kapoor]]) and Inspector Simon ([[Bob Christo]]) conspire with a snivelling, weak-willed local doctor Harry ([[Prem Chopra]]) to capture Raja. Harry sedates Raja; weakened thus, Raja is captured and imprisoned in a dungeon. Rani Durga escapes on Raja's faithful steed Bahadur. But she is shot, and the horse brings baby Raju to a local orphanage for safekeeping until Rani Durga can recuperate and reclaim him. The wife of a poor blacksmith spots baby Raju in the orphanage, asks after him and eventually adopts him. When Rani Durga returns, she is shocked to find her baby gone and she loses the ability to speak. The penniless Rani Durga eventually becomes a washerwoman. The traitor Harry is appointed mayor of the town for his part in the capture of Raja.\n\nRaju grows up to become a strong youth under the care of the loving blacksmith and his wife. His day job is to run a [[Tanga (carriage)|tanga]]. One day, he happens across an arrogant and oppressive young woman who blithely runs her car over an old lady. Raju gives chase, intercepts the young woman, and compels her to apologise to the old lady. The young woman is of high birth, and her bodyguard Zybisko ([[Manik Irani]]) engages Raju, but Raju fends him off quite easily. The young woman turns out to be Ruby, the daughter of mayor Harry. Ruby apologises. But she is charmed by Raju's rugged looks and candour. He initially refuses her advances to maintain his independence. But she eventually falls in love, changes his heart, and invites him to her birthday party.\n\nHarry and General Dyer continue their relentless quest for power. Their first move is to demolish the ''basti'' (slum colony) in front of Harry's mansion. Raju rallies the ''basti'' dwellers to oppose the demolition crew and picket Harry's mansion. Harry arrests Raju and is about to execute him when Lady Helena arrives on the scene. Lady Helena stops the demolition (citing lack of documentation), reprimands Harry, and releases Raju. Harry tries to buy off Raju, but Raju douses the cases with liquor, sets it afire, and uses the soot to blacken Harry's face. (No, it is certainly black money, for it burns black, he observes!) A frustrated Harry tries to have him a shot, but Ruby intervenes, professes her love for the ''tanga wallah'' (tanga driver), and threatens to completely disavow her father if any harm should befall him. Unable to subdue or subvert Raju, a frustrated set of cronies (Harry, Dyer, Simon, and others) fret and fume.\n\nThe film introduces Danny (Dan Dhanoa) the son of General Dyer. Danny is every bit as corrupt, cunning, and avaricious as his father and his cronies. Danny runs the nefarious operations beneath the outwardly clean, lordly and manorial life of General Dyer and mayor Harry. There are three such operations. First, there is a secret blood camp; ''basti'' dwellers that are infirm, aged or otherwise unfit are secretly abducted and their blood (all of it) is involuntarily extracted to supply British war campaigns elsewhere. Second, there is a slave labour camp where, again, ''basti'' dwellers are put to work (with no pay) on various civil and construction projects for the British empire. And finally there is Raja Azad Singh, still imprisoned, and a champion for the ''basti'' and for the workers in the labour camps. His primary duty is to turn, by hand, a massive flour mill; this mill is the only source of food for the camps. (Rani Durga, it turns out, is a washerwoman in one of these camps.) The camps grow in size, and Raja Azad Singh secretly plans to have them revolt; this becomes a growing concern for Harry.\n\nHarry and General Dyer decide the best way to remove Raju from the picture is to announce the engagement of Ruby and Danny. Ruby strongly opposes this and runs off with Raju. Danny gives chase with his men, and even tries to kill Ruby, but eventually brings her back to Harry. Harry is truly enraged. He threatens to kill Ruby if she ever disobeys him again. Danny devises a nefarious plot to get rid of Raju.\n\nAs the first step in the plot, Danny captures the blacksmith, burns his hovel, murders his wife, and puts the blacksmith in a slave camp. (As she lays dying, she reveals to Raju the story of his birth. Raju cremates his foster mother and writes out a letter for his real mother, which he immerses into the river along with the ashes of his foster mother. The river carries his note to the camp where the blacksmith finds it and reads it out to Rani Durga, who immediately recalls her story. The blacksmith stages a stick-up to facilitate her escape, and she is ultimately reunited with Raju. The blacksmith, however, is killed.)\n\nDanny learns of Raju's lineage. Realizing Raju will attack the camp to free the blacksmith and Raja Azad Singh, Danny plays the second step of his plot and lays a trap. Raju enters the dungeon to rescue his father. But it turns out that Raja Azad Singh has been replaced by a masked impostor (Simon), and Raju is captured.\n\nAt this point, Danny devises a fatal final step. He announces a gladiatorial sword fight between Raju and Raja Azad Singh where the winner will go free. Prior to this fight, he takes steps to ensure father and son are truly bloodthirsty for the other. Raja Azad Singh is brought to a blood camp where he sees Raju (actually a masked imposter) extracting blood from innocent citizens and swearing loyalty to the British; the Raja is incensed and swears to finish him off in the contest. Concurrently, Danny sends word (through Ruby) that the fighter opposing Raju will be a masked impostor and not the real Raja. Raju, in turn, announces he will not let his opponent leave the ring alive. And Danny forthwith arranges to have the real Raja fight Raju.\n\nThe contest begins on the next day, and father and son are soon in a crazed sword fight. The duel takes a turn when the Raja spots the word ''mard'' on Raju's chest, and Raju notices one of his blows drew blood from the Raja's cheek. They quickly discover the truth and keep up the appearance of a death duel until the Raja hoists Raju off the arena and into the viewing gallery. Raju plunges his sword into General Dyer, killing him instantly.\n\nDanny is infuriated. He orders his tanks to finish off Raju and the Raja. (Lady Helena and Rani Durga are strapped to the tanks, with British soldiers holding them at gunpoint.) Raju and the Raja seize horses and escape, with the tanks in hot pursuit. After a long chase and fight, Raju and the Raja overpower the tanks, rescue the ladies and engage the villains in combat. After a hard sword-and-gun fight, Harry, Danny, and Goga are drowned in quicksand, and Raju and his father return victorious.\n\nThe film ends with Raju and Ruby coming together and being reunited with Raju's real parents, on the dawn of India's independence movement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Raju/Mard\n* [[Amrita Singh]] as Ruby\n* [[Dara Singh]] as Raja Azaad Singh\n* [[Nirupa Roy]] as Rani Durga\n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Dr. Harry\n* [[Kamal Kapoor]] as [[General Dyer]]\n* [[Bob Christo]]\tas\tInspector Simon\n* [[Satyen Kappu]]\tas\tBlacksmith (Jamuna's Husband)\n* [[Manik Irani]] as Zbyszko (as Manek Irani)\n* [[Seema Deo]]\t\tas\tJamuna\n* [[Dan Dhanoa]]\tas\tDanny Dyer\n* [[Joginder | Joginder Shelly]]\tas\tStreet Dancer 'Jako Rakhe Saiyan'\n* Kirti Kumar\tas\tShamsher (Guest Appearance)\n* C.S.

They quickly discover the truth and keep up the appearance of a death duel until the Raja hoists Raju off the arena and into the viewing gallery. Raju plunges his sword into General Dyer, killing him instantly.\n\nDanny is infuriated. He orders his tanks to finish off Raju and the Raja. (Lady Helena and Rani Durga are strapped to the tanks, with British soldiers holding them at gunpoint.) Raju and the Raja seize horses and escape, with the tanks in hot pursuit. After a long chase and fight, Raju and the Raja overpower the tanks, rescue the ladies and engage the villains in combat. After a hard sword-and-gun fight, Harry, Danny, and Goga are drowned in quicksand, and Raju and his father return victorious.\n\nThe film ends with Raju and Ruby coming together and being reunited with Raju's real parents, on the dawn of India's independence movement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Raju/Mard\n* [[Amrita Singh]] as Ruby\n* [[Dara Singh]] as Raja Azaad Singh\n* [[Nirupa Roy]] as Rani Durga\n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Dr. Harry\n* [[Kamal Kapoor]] as [[General Dyer]]\n* [[Bob Christo]]\tas\tInspector Simon\n* [[Satyen Kappu]]\tas\tBlacksmith (Jamuna's Husband)\n* [[Manik Irani]] as Zbyszko (as Manek Irani)\n* [[Seema Deo]]\t\tas\tJamuna\n* [[Dan Dhanoa]]\tas\tDanny Dyer\n* [[Joginder | Joginder Shelly]]\tas\tStreet Dancer 'Jako Rakhe Saiyan'\n* Kirti Kumar\tas\tShamsher (Guest Appearance)\n* C.S.

They are sitting by the fire one evening, Mrs. White getting food ready and Mr. White is playing chess with Herbert, when Sergeant-Major Morris, a friend who served with the British Army in India, comes by for dinner and introduces them to a mummified monkey's paw. An old [[fakir]] placed a spell on the paw, so that it would grant three wishes. These three wishes are granted to the owner with hellish consequences as punishment for tampering with fate. Morris, having had a horrible experience using the paw, throws it into the fire. Mr. White, not believing Morris, retrieves it. Before leaving, Morris warns Mr. White that should he use the paw, then he might as well be digging his own grave.\n\nAt Herbert's suggestion, Mr. White flippantly wishes for \u00a3200 (the equivalent of over \u00a324,000 in 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.in2013dollars.com/uk/inflation/1902?amount=200|title=UK Inflation Calculator on In2013Dollars.com}}</ref>), which will enable him to make the final mortgage payment for his house; as though he believes he has everything he wants. When he makes his wish, Mr. White suddenly drops the paw in surprise, claiming that it moved and twisted like a snake, just as  he was making the wish. That night, after Mr. and Mrs. White have gone to bed, Herbert stays up later and while gazing at the dying fire, sees what eerily appears to be a horrible, monkey-like face, burned into the soot. The next day, Herbert leaves for work at a local factory. A few minutes after Herbert has left, an employee arrives at the White's home pronouncing that Herbert has been killed in a terrible machine accident, mutilating his body. Although the company denies responsibility for the incident, the firm has decided to make a goodwill payment to the family of the deceased. The payment is \u00a3200.\n\nTen days after their son's death and a week after the funeral, Mrs. White, mad with grief, insists that her husband use the paw to wish Herbert back to life. Reluctantly he does so, despite remembering a premonition he had of summoning his son's mutilated and decomposing body. An hour or so later\u2014the cemetery being two miles away\u2014there is a knock at the door. As Mrs. White fumbles at the locks in a desperate attempt to open the door, Mr. White becomes terrified and fears \"the thing outside\" is not the son whom he loved and remembers. He makes his third wish. The knocking stops suddenly and Mrs. White opens the door to find no one is there. She wails in disappointment and misery.\n\n== Notable versions in other media ==\n<!-- Please include secondary sourcing establishing the significance of any references.

{"title_page": "Judiciary of Angola", "text_new": "The '''Judiciary of Angola''' is defined by the Constitution of [[Angola]], which outlines the structure of a Unified Justice System  (''Sistema Unificado de Justica''). The courts are intended to be independent sovereign bodies administering impartial justice on behalf of the people. Their duty is to guarantee and ensure compliance with the Constitutional and other laws in force, to protect the rights and interests of citizens and institutions and to decide on the legality of administrative acts. <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Angola.html#_1.3_The_Courts|title= Republic of Angola - Legal System and Research|publisher= Hauser Global Law|accessdate = 27 February 2016}} </ref>\n\nAt the lowest level the system involves Municipal Courts, trial courts whose judges are usually laymen. Appeals in civil matters are heard by the Provincial Court and in criminal matters by the Supreme Court.\n\nProvincial Courts administered by the Ministry of Justice and located in each of the 18 provincial capitals (two in Benguela Province) ae trial courts whose judges are nominated by the Supreme Court. Judges of the Provincial Courts, along with two laymen, act as a jury. \n\nThe Supreme Court (''Tribunal Supremo''), founded in 1985 and based in [[Luanda]], hears appeals from the lower courts.
