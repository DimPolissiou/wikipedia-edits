Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]]. The Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}} carried dispatches of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and news of the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], to England.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Bermuda and the American War of Independence===\nBermuda's ambivalence towards the American rebellion changed in September 1774, when the [[Continental Congress]] resolved to ban trade with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies after 10 September 1775. Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|428\u2013433}}\n\n[[The Bermuda Gazette]], Bermuda's first newspaper, began publishing in 1784.<ref name=\"Stark\">{{cite book |last1=Stark |first1=James Henry |title=Stark's Illustrated Bermuda Guide: A Description of Everything on Or about These Places of which the Visitor Or Resident May Desire Information, Including Their History, Inhabitants, Climate, Agriculture, Geology, Government and Resources |date=1897 |publisher=J.H.Stark |location=Bermuda Island (Bermuda Islands) |page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T11qAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&q=1784%20bermuda%20stockdale |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"200th\">{{cite web |last1=Rigby |first1=Neil |title=1984 200th Anniversary of Bermuda's first Newspaper and Postal Service |date=26 January 1984 |url=http://www.bermudastamps.co.uk/1984/01/26/200th-anniversary-bermudas-first-newspaper-postal-service/ |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"TBG\">{{cite web |title=The Bermuda gazette |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn89049233/ |publisher=United States Library of Congress |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Devonshire Redoubt (Bermuda).png|thumb|left|An illustration of the Devonshire Redoubt, Bermuda, 1614]]\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours on the Bermudas.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], substantially nearer to Bermuda than is the Caribbean. However, with the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and their attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British political, naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the Royal Navy headquarters had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round, and the Bermuda Garrison had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, as part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, and a separate Bermuda Command from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.\n\nPrior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained \"white\" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009.

Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.

The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]].

Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|428\u2013433}}\n\n[[The Bermuda Gazette]], Bermuda's first newspaper, began publishing in 1784.<ref name=\"Stark\">{{cite book |last1=Stark |first1=James Henry |title=Stark's Illustrated Bermuda Guide: A Description of Everything on Or about These Places of which the Visitor Or Resident May Desire Information, Including Their History, Inhabitants, Climate, Agriculture, Geology, Government and Resources |date=1897 |publisher=J.H.Stark |location=Bermuda Island (Bermuda Islands) |page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T11qAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&q=1784%20bermuda%20stockdale |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"200th\">{{cite web |last1=Rigby |first1=Neil |title=1984 200th Anniversary of Bermuda's first Newspaper and Postal Service |date=26 January 1984 |url=http://www.bermudastamps.co.uk/1984/01/26/200th-anniversary-bermudas-first-newspaper-postal-service/ |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"TBG\">{{cite web |title=The Bermuda gazette |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn89049233/ |publisher=United States Library of Congress |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Devonshire Redoubt (Bermuda).png|thumb|left|An illustration of the Devonshire Redoubt, Bermuda, 1614]]\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours on the Bermudas.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. With the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and the unified Canada's attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the Royal Navy headquarters had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round, and the Bermuda Garrison had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, as part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, and a separate Bermuda Command from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.\n\nPrior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained \"white\" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009.

Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.

{"title_page": "Social dominance theory", "text_new": "Ha, you thought you were getting information nope I got rid of it.\n\n==Hegemonic group==\nSocial dominance theory is a consideration of group conflict which describes human society as consisting of oppressive group-based hierarchy structures. The key principles of social dominance theory are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n*Individuals are stratified by age, sex and group. Group identification is based on ethnicity, religion, nationality, and so on.\n*Human social hierarchy consists of a hegemonic group at the top and negative reference groups at the bottom.\n*As a role gets more powerful, the probability it is occupied by a hegemonic group member increases (Law of increasing proportion).\n*Males are more dominant than females; they possess more political power (the iron law of andrarchy). Most high-power positions will be held by males.\n*Racism, sexism, nationalism and classism are all manifestations of this same principle of social hierarchy.\n\n==Group hierarchy==\nThe reason that social hierarchies exist in human societies is that they were necessary for survival of inter-group competition during conflict over resources.<ref name=\"Grusky1992\">{{cite encyclopedia|year=1992|title=Social Stratification|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Sociology|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company.|pages=1955\u201370|author=Grusky, David B. and Ann Azumi Takata}}</ref> Essentially, groups organised in hierarchies were more efficient at combat than groups who were organised in other ways, giving a competitive advantage to groups disposed towards social hierarchies.\n\nSocial dominance theory explains the mechanisms of group hierarchy oppression using three basic mechanisms:{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n*Aggregated individual discrimination (ordinary discrimination)\n*Aggregated institutional discrimination (discrimination by governmental and business institutions)\n**Systematic Terror (police violence, death squads, etc.)\n*Behavioural asymmetry\n**systematic outgroup favouritism or deference (minorities favour hegemony individuals)\n*asymmetric ingroup bias (as status increases, in-group favoritism decreases)\n*self-handicapping (low expectations of minorities are self-fulfilling prophecies)\n*ideological asymmetry (as status increases, so beliefs legitimizing and or enhancing the current social hierarchy)\n\nThese processes are driven by legitimizing myths, which are beliefs that justify social dominance:\n*paternalistic myths (hegemony serves society, looks after incapable minorities)\n*reciprocal myths (suggestions that hegemonic and outgroups are actually equal)\n*sacred myths (Divine right of kings \u2013 religion-approved mandate for hegemony to govern)\n\nSocial dominance theory is a multi-level theory of how societies maintain group-based dominance. Proposed initially by Sidanius and Pratto (1999), the theory assumes that societies are based on social structures in which dominant groups have higher social status, political authority, power and wealth. Thus, a group-based hierarchy in which dominant groups secure a disproportionate share of the good things in life whiles subordinate groups receives a disproportionate share of the bad stuff. Over time, such structures incorporate into a legitimized myth that serves to perpetuate and maintain this form of group-based hierarchy and creates an ideology that strengthens social dominance, creates intergroup oppression, discrimination and supports prejudice (Pratto & Stewart, 2012).\nNotably, social hierarchy is a universal feature that marks humanity. However, the nature of these hierarchical differences and inequality differs across cultures and societies. \nThe theory identifies two aspects of myth legitimization. Hierarchy enhancing legitimizing myth perpetuates inequality and maintains intergroup inequality, whereas hierarchy attenuating legitimizing myth decreases group-based inequalities and ensures equity. Myth legitimation has implications for human rights and social justice. \nFor instance, hierarchy attenuating myths argue for a reduction of the disparities that exist between social groups in their access to resources, power, and legitimacy. Whiles hierarchy enhancing legitimizing myths suggest that some rights and privileges are reserved only for certain groups, serving to increase group-based inequality and social hierarchy. \nScales measuring social dominance orientation correlate robustly across countries with a variety of kinds of group prejudices (including sexism, sexual orientation prejudice, racism, nationalism) and with hierarchy - enhancing policies (Pratto & Stewart, 2012). Social dominance orientation correlates negatively with tolerance, egalitarianism, universalism, humanitarianism, and support for hierarchy - attenuating policies such as human rights (e.g. Pratto, Sidanius, & Levin, 2006 ).\n\n==Duckitt and right-wing authoritarianism==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2017}}\nResearcher at [[University of Auckland]], John Duckitt, accepts the concept of Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and attempts to pair it to a related set of beliefs, [[Right Wing Authoritarianism]] (RWA).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229696620|title=Right Wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation and the dimensions of generalized prejudice|last=Duckitt|first=John|last2=Sibley|first2=Chris|date=2007-03-01|publisher=European Journal of Personality, Wiley InterScience|isbn=|volume=21|location=|pages=}}</ref> A scale was produced to measure RWA, and it was focused on conventionalism, authoritarian aggression and authoritarian submission.<ref name=\":0\" /> These three core authoritarian characteristics were identi\ufb01ed in the sociology book, ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuckitt proposes a model in which RWA and SDO are produced by socialization in childhood, by personality, and by worldview beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Punitive socialisation is hypothesised as a cause of social conformity. This conformity is predicted to lead to a view of the world as a dangerous, dog-eat-dog place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} These correspond to high\u2013RWA beliefs, and in turn influence ingroup and [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Unaffectionate socialisation is hypothesised to cause tough-minded attitudes. This promotes a view of the world as competitive, similar to the jungle of the evolutionary past. The need to compete is aligned with high SDO, and, again, influences ingroup and outgroup attitudes.\n\nThese two streams of causation may co-occur. [[Parenting styles]] may be both punitive and unaffectionate, and a competitive-jungle worldview is compatible with world\u2013as\u2013a-dangerous-place. Once established, high\u2013RWA beliefs are hypothesised to promote high\u2013SDO beliefs and vice versa. This predicts high correlations between the two, with environmental origins. On top of this, outgroup and ingroup attitudes may reinforce each other.\n\nDuckitt further examines the complexities of the interaction between RWA, SDO and a variety of specific ideological/prejudicial beliefs and behaviour. For instance:{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n* RWA beliefs are activated by social threat or threatening out-groups\n* SDO beliefs are activated by competition and intergroup inequalities in status and power\n* RWA is a stronger predictor of prejudice when the outgroup is threatening\n* When group status is unstable, SDO is associated with higher ingroup bias than when group status is stable\n* Outgroup liking is best predicted by similarity to the ingroup, while outgroup respect is predicted by status and technological advancement\n\nDuckitt concludes that RWA and SDO have been well studied, and points out that this way of examining belief-paradigms and motivation-schemas could also be useful for examining anti-authoritarian-libertarian and egalitarian-altruistic ideologies.\n\n==Relation to Marxism==\nSDT is influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] and socio-biological ideas. [[Marx]] described the oppressive hierarchy of hegemonic group(s) dominating negative reference groups, in his examples the [[bourgeoisie]] (owning class) dominate the [[proletariat]] (working class) by controlling [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (the means of production), not paying workers enough, and so on. However Marx thought that the working class would eventually grasp the solution to this oppression and destroy the bourgeoisie in a [[revolution]].\n\n==Felicia Pratto and legitimizing myths theory==\nLegitimizing myths theory is about ideologies that explain and justify social systems. The term \"myth\" is meant to imply that everyone in society perceives these ideologies as explanations for how the world works, not whether or not they are true or false (indeed Sidanius and Pratto make no claims as to the truthfulness, morality or fairness of these ideologies).<ref>Pratto, Felicia, Jim Sidanius, Lisa M. Stallworth, and Bertram F. Malle. \"Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes.\" Journal of personality and social psychology 67, no. 4 (1994): 741.</ref> There are two functional types of legitimizing myths: (1) hierarchy-enhancing and (2) hierarchy-attenuating legitimizing myths. Hierarchy-enhancing ideologies (e.g., [[racism]] or [[meritocracy]]) contribute to greater levels of group-based inequality. Hierarchy-attenuating ideologies (e.g., [[anarchism]] and [[feminism]]) contribute to greater levels of group-based equality. People endorse these different forms of ideologies based in part on their psychological orientation toward dominance and their desire for unequal group relations (i.e., their [[social dominance orientation]]; SDO).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Pratto|first=Felicia|last2=Sidanius|first2=James|last3=Stallworth|first3=Lisa|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram|date=1994|title=Social Dominance Orientation: A Personality Variable Predicting Social and Political Attitudes|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3207711/Sidanius_SocialDominanceOrientation.pdf?sequence=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67|issue=4|pages=741\u2013763|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741|access-date=2018-07-29|via=Harvard University DASH repository}}</ref> People who are higher on SDO tend to endorse hierarchy-enhancing ideologies, and people who are lower on SDO tend to endorse hierarchy-attenuating ideologies. SDT finally proposes that the relative counterbalancing of hierarchy-enhancing and -attenuating social forces stabilizes group-based inequality.\n\nVarious processes of hierarchical [[discrimination]] are driven by ''legitimizing [[myth]]s'' (Sidanius, 1992), which are beliefs justifying social dominance, such as [[paternalism|paternalistic]] myths ([[hegemony]] serves society, looks after incapable [[Minority group|minorities]]), reciprocal myths (suggestions that hegemonic groups and outgroups are actually [[Social equality|equal]]), and [[sacred]] myths (the [[divine right of kings]], as a religion-approved mandate for hegemony to govern).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Sidanius|first=Jim|last2=Pratto|first2=Felicia|last3=Devereux|first3=Erik|date=1992|title=A Comparison of Symbolic Racism Theory and Social Dominance Theory as Explanations for Racial Policy Attitudes|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=132|issue=3|pages=377\u2013395|doi=10.1080/00224545.1992.9924713}}</ref> Pratto et al.

The theory proposes that widely shared cultural ideologies (i.e., legitimizing myths) provide the moral and intellectual justification for these intergroup behaviors.\n\nSocial dominance theory was first formulated in 1999 by psychology professors and researchers, [[Jim Sidanius]] and [[Felicia Pratto]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/social-dominance-theory-definition-examples.html|title=Social Dominance Theory: Definition & Examples|last=|first=|date=|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}</ref> The theory begins with the observation that human social groups tend to be organized according to group-based social hierarchies in societies that produce economic surplus. These hierarchies have a trimorphic (3-form) structure. This means that these hierarchies are based on (1) age (i.e., adults have more power and higher status than children), (2) sex (i.e., men have more power and higher status than women), and (3) arbitrary-set, which are group-based hierarchies that are culturally defined and do not necessarily exist in all societies. Arbitrary-set hierarchies can be based on ethnicity (e.g., Whites over Blacks in the U.S.), religion, nationality, and so on.\n\nHuman social hierarchies consist of a [[hegemony|hegemonic group]] at the top and negative reference groups at the bottom. More powerful social roles are increasingly likely to be occupied by a hegemonic group member (for example, an older white male). Males are more dominant than females, and they possess more political power (the iron law of [[Androcracy|andrarchy]]). Most high-status positions are held by males.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Hegemonic group==\nSocial dominance theory is a consideration of group conflict which describes human society as consisting of oppressive group-based hierarchy structures. The key principles of social dominance theory are:{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n*Individuals are stratified by age, sex and group. Group identification is based on ethnicity, religion, nationality, and so on.\n*Human social hierarchy consists of a hegemonic group at the top and negative reference groups at the bottom.\n*As a role gets more powerful, the probability it is occupied by a hegemonic group member increases (Law of increasing proportion).\n*Males are more dominant than females; they possess more political power (the iron law of andrarchy). Most high-power positions will be held by males.\n*Racism, sexism, nationalism and classism are all manifestations of this same principle of social hierarchy.\n\n==Group hierarchy==\nThe reason that social hierarchies exist in human societies is that they were necessary for survival of inter-group competition during conflict over resources.<ref name=\"Grusky1992\">{{cite encyclopedia|year=1992|title=Social Stratification|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Sociology|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company.|pages=1955\u201370|author=Grusky, David B. and Ann Azumi Takata}}</ref> Essentially, groups organised in hierarchies were more efficient at combat than groups who were organised in other ways, giving a competitive advantage to groups disposed towards social hierarchies.\n\nSocial dominance theory explains the mechanisms of group hierarchy oppression using three basic mechanisms:{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n*Aggregated individual discrimination (ordinary discrimination)\n*Aggregated institutional discrimination (discrimination by governmental and business institutions)\n**Systematic Terror (police violence, death squads, etc.)\n*Behavioural asymmetry\n**systematic outgroup favouritism or deference (minorities favour hegemony individuals)\n*asymmetric ingroup bias (as status increases, in-group favoritism decreases)\n*self-handicapping (low expectations of minorities are self-fulfilling prophecies)\n*ideological asymmetry (as status increases, so beliefs legitimizing and or enhancing the current social hierarchy)\n\nThese processes are driven by legitimizing myths, which are beliefs that justify social dominance:\n*paternalistic myths (hegemony serves society, looks after incapable minorities)\n*reciprocal myths (suggestions that hegemonic and outgroups are actually equal)\n*sacred myths (Divine right of kings \u2013 religion-approved mandate for hegemony to govern)\n\nSocial dominance theory is a multi-level theory of how societies maintain group-based dominance. Proposed initially by Sidanius and Pratto (1999), the theory assumes that societies are based on social structures in which dominant groups have higher social status, political authority, power and wealth. Thus, a group-based hierarchy in which dominant groups secure a disproportionate share of the good things in life whiles subordinate groups receives a disproportionate share of the bad stuff. Over time, such structures incorporate into a legitimized myth that serves to perpetuate and maintain this form of group-based hierarchy and creates an ideology that strengthens social dominance, creates intergroup oppression, discrimination and supports prejudice (Pratto & Stewart, 2012).\nNotably, social hierarchy is a universal feature that marks humanity. However, the nature of these hierarchical differences and inequality differs across cultures and societies. \nThe theory identifies two aspects of myth legitimization. Hierarchy enhancing legitimizing myth perpetuates inequality and maintains intergroup inequality, whereas hierarchy attenuating legitimizing myth decreases group-based inequalities and ensures equity. Myth legitimation has implications for human rights and social justice. \nFor instance, hierarchy attenuating myths argue for a reduction of the disparities that exist between social groups in their access to resources, power, and legitimacy. Whiles hierarchy enhancing legitimizing myths suggest that some rights and privileges are reserved only for certain groups, serving to increase group-based inequality and social hierarchy. \nScales measuring social dominance orientation correlate robustly across countries with a variety of kinds of group prejudices (including sexism, sexual orientation prejudice, racism, nationalism) and with hierarchy - enhancing policies (Pratto & Stewart, 2012). Social dominance orientation correlates negatively with tolerance, egalitarianism, universalism, humanitarianism, and support for hierarchy - attenuating policies such as human rights (e.g. Pratto, Sidanius, & Levin, 2006 ).\n\n==Duckitt and right-wing authoritarianism==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2017}}\nResearcher at [[University of Auckland]], John Duckitt, accepts the concept of Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and attempts to pair it to a related set of beliefs, [[Right Wing Authoritarianism]] (RWA).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229696620|title=Right Wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation and the dimensions of generalized prejudice|last=Duckitt|first=John|last2=Sibley|first2=Chris|date=2007-03-01|publisher=European Journal of Personality, Wiley InterScience|isbn=|volume=21|location=|pages=}}</ref> A scale was produced to measure RWA, and it was focused on conventionalism, authoritarian aggression and authoritarian submission.<ref name=\":0\" /> These three core authoritarian characteristics were identi\ufb01ed in the sociology book, ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuckitt proposes a model in which RWA and SDO are produced by socialization in childhood, by personality, and by worldview beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Punitive socialisation is hypothesised as a cause of social conformity. This conformity is predicted to lead to a view of the world as a dangerous, dog-eat-dog place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} These correspond to high\u2013RWA beliefs, and in turn influence ingroup and [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] attitudes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Unaffectionate socialisation is hypothesised to cause tough-minded attitudes. This promotes a view of the world as competitive, similar to the jungle of the evolutionary past. The need to compete is aligned with high SDO, and, again, influences ingroup and outgroup attitudes.\n\nThese two streams of causation may co-occur. [[Parenting styles]] may be both punitive and unaffectionate, and a competitive-jungle worldview is compatible with world\u2013as\u2013a-dangerous-place. Once established, high\u2013RWA beliefs are hypothesised to promote high\u2013SDO beliefs and vice versa. This predicts high correlations between the two, with environmental origins. On top of this, outgroup and ingroup attitudes may reinforce each other.\n\nDuckitt further examines the complexities of the interaction between RWA, SDO and a variety of specific ideological/prejudicial beliefs and behaviour. For instance:{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n* RWA beliefs are activated by social threat or threatening out-groups\n* SDO beliefs are activated by competition and intergroup inequalities in status and power\n* RWA is a stronger predictor of prejudice when the outgroup is threatening\n* When group status is unstable, SDO is associated with higher ingroup bias than when group status is stable\n* Outgroup liking is best predicted by similarity to the ingroup, while outgroup respect is predicted by status and technological advancement\n\nDuckitt concludes that RWA and SDO have been well studied, and points out that this way of examining belief-paradigms and motivation-schemas could also be useful for examining anti-authoritarian-libertarian and egalitarian-altruistic ideologies.\n\n==Relation to Marxism==\nSDT is influenced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] and socio-biological ideas. [[Marx]] described the oppressive hierarchy of hegemonic group(s) dominating negative reference groups, in his examples the [[bourgeoisie]] (owning class) dominate the [[proletariat]] (working class) by controlling [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (the means of production), not paying workers enough, and so on. However Marx thought that the working class would eventually grasp the solution to this oppression and destroy the bourgeoisie in a [[revolution]].\n\n==Felicia Pratto and legitimizing myths theory==\nLegitimizing myths theory is about ideologies that explain and justify social systems. The term \"myth\" is meant to imply that everyone in society perceives these ideologies as explanations for how the world works, not whether or not they are true or false (indeed Sidanius and Pratto make no claims as to the truthfulness, morality or fairness of these ideologies).<ref>Pratto, Felicia, Jim Sidanius, Lisa M. Stallworth, and Bertram F. Malle. \"Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes.\" Journal of personality and social psychology 67, no. 4 (1994): 741.</ref> There are two functional types of legitimizing myths: (1) hierarchy-enhancing and (2) hierarchy-attenuating legitimizing myths. Hierarchy-enhancing ideologies (e.g., [[racism]] or [[meritocracy]]) contribute to greater levels of group-based inequality. Hierarchy-attenuating ideologies (e.g., [[anarchism]] and [[feminism]]) contribute to greater levels of group-based equality. People endorse these different forms of ideologies based in part on their psychological orientation toward dominance and their desire for unequal group relations (i.e., their [[social dominance orientation]]; SDO).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Pratto|first=Felicia|last2=Sidanius|first2=James|last3=Stallworth|first3=Lisa|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram|date=1994|title=Social Dominance Orientation: A Personality Variable Predicting Social and Political Attitudes|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3207711/Sidanius_SocialDominanceOrientation.pdf?sequence=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67|issue=4|pages=741\u2013763|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741|access-date=2018-07-29|via=Harvard University DASH repository}}</ref> People who are higher on SDO tend to endorse hierarchy-enhancing ideologies, and people who are lower on SDO tend to endorse hierarchy-attenuating ideologies.

The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.
