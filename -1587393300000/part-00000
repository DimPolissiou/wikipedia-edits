It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J. Falzone, \"Terence V. Powderly: Politician and Progressive Mayor of Scranton, 1878-1884,\" ''Pennsylvania History'' 41.3 (1974): 289-309.</ref> While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop [[James Gibbons]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing.\n\nThe landmark [[Coal strike of 1902]], was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]]. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W. R.R. yards, Scranton, Pa. between 1890 and 1901.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] yards in Scranton, ca.1895]]\n\nBy the [[United States Census]] of 1900, the population of Scranton was about 102,026, making it the third-largest city in Pennsylvania and 38th-largest U.S. city.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/4269000.html|title=Scranton(city) QuickFacts|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>\nAt the turn of the 20th century, wealthy businessmen and industrialists built impressive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions in the Hill and Green Ridge sections of the city. Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the city's buildings and history. Some historic properties have been renovated and marketed as tourist attractions. The [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] captures the area's once-prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&W train station was restored as the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]]. The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] was created next to the DL&W yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies.\n\nSince the mid-1980s the [[Scranton Cultural Center]] has operated the architecturally significant Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, designed by [[Raymond Hood]], as the region's performing arts center. The [[Houdini Museum]] was opened in Scranton in 1990 by nationally known magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]].\n\nIn 2003, [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]] opened the [http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/pennsylvania/hilton-scranton-and-conference-center-SCRCCHF/index.html Hilton Scranton Hotel & Conference Center] at the corner of Adams Avenue & Lackawanna Avenue in the heart of downtown Scranton.

It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J.

The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

They were one of three royal gunpowder factories; but the Ballincollig mills became disused after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. They were sold off by the government in 1832, in a semi-derelict condition; but were bought by a [[Liverpool]] merchant and were reopened to manufacture gunpowder; finally closing, just over a century ago, in 1903. Many buildings survive and, together with the associated [[canal]]s, were incorporated into a regional park \u2013 Ballincollig Regional Park. The site contains a number of powder magazines, as well as Expense magazines.<ref name=webb-donaldson>Webb, Jenny and Donaldson, Ann (2006). ''Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills: a hidden history''.

Until the end of the sixteenth century, [[Bartizan|echauguettes]] were used to store gunpowder. The Order also built a magazine in [[Valletta]], but this exploded in 1634, killing 22 people. After the explosion, a new magazine was built in [[Floriana]], which was sparsely populated, to avoid another disaster. Various other magazines were built over the years, and their designs were influenced by French military architecture, particularly the style of [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]].

It usually carried about 273&nbsp;kg gunpowder, 7,000 ball cartridges and 60 rifles as stock.  In 1870 the British Military built a powder magazine in the Northern Cape town of [[Fraserburg]] (also still standing) in case of war with the neighbouring [[Griqua people]] and subsequently used in the [[Anglo-Boer War]].\n\n==In the United Kingdom==\n[[File:Tilbury Fort, Essex - geograph.org.uk - 794674.jpg|thumb|left|Tilbury: a unique pair of early 18th-century magazines within the Fort]]\nProduction of gunpowder in England appears to have started in the mid-13th century with the aim of supplying [[The Crown]].<ref name=cocroft-1>Cocroft (2000). Chapter 1: \"Success to the Black Art!\".</ref> Records show that gunpowder was being made in 1346, at the [[Tower of London]]; a [[powder house]] existed at the Tower in 1461.<ref name =cocroft-1/> Gunpowder was also being made or stored at other royal residences such as [[Greenwich Palace]] (the reason being that these were where the royal armouries were based). It was also stored in [[Scotland]], in royal castles, such as [[Edinburgh Castle]]. Gunpowder manufacture at [[Faversham explosives industry|Faversham]] began as a private enterprise in the 16th century.\n\nFrom the 18th century, efforts began to be made to site magazines away from inhabited areas. Nevertheless, storage at the older established sites persisted well into the 19th century.\n\nThe use of gunpowder for both military and civil engineering purposes began to be superseded by newer [[nitrogen]]-based [[Explosive material|explosives]] from the later 19th century. Gunpowder production in the United Kingdom was gradually phased out during the mid-20th century. The last remaining gunpowder mill at the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey]] was damaged by a German [[Land mine|parachute mine]] in 1941 and it never reopened.<ref name =cocroft-4>Cocroft (2000). Chapter 4: \"The demise of gunpowder\".</ref> This was followed by the closure of the gunpowder section at the [[Royal Ordnance Factory]], [[ROF Chorley]], the section was closed and demolished at the end of World War II, and [[Nobel Enterprises|ICI Nobel's]] [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] gunpowder factory which closed in 1954.<ref name =cocroft-4/> This left the sole United Kingdom gunpowder factory at ICI Nobel's Ardeer site in [[North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]]; it too closed in October 1976.<ref name =cocroft-4/> Since then gunpowder has been imported into the United Kingdom.\n\nGunpowder magazines survive at several locations in the UK. It can be seen that, in many cases, the gunpowder was stored in locations which were both remote from habitations and could be made secure. They were also often sited in dense woodland (or had trees planted around them) as a way of lessening the effect of any explosion.\n\n===In England===\n\n====Berwick-upon-Tweed====\n[[File:Gunpowder magazine, Berwick-upon-Tweed - geograph.org.uk - 1351482.jpg|thumbnail|Gunpowder magazine, Berwick]]\nThe Gunpowder Magazine in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] was built in 1745 to service [[Berwick Barracks]] and sited at a safe distance from them to the south. It is a solid stone building, heavily buttressed, windowless, stone roofed and enclosed by a stone wall. Along with Purfleet and Tilbury it is one of the few surviving eighteenth-century gunpowder magazines in the country.\n\n====Brean Down Fort, Somerset====\n{{Main|Brean Down Fort}}\nBrean Down Fort was one of a number of ''[[Palmerston Forts]]'' built to defend the British, Irish and Channel Island coastlines. It was originally built in stages between 1862 and 1870; to protect the [[Bristol Channel]].  It had a large, underground, main gunpowder magazine, 15-foot (4.5 m) by 18-foot (5.5 m) by 20-foot (6.1 m) high, built to the recommendations of the 1863 [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom|Royal Commission]]. The magazine still exists. A further two, smaller, underground magazines, ''No. 2 magazine'' and ''No. 3 magazine'', were also built. No. 3 magazine exploded on 3 July 1900 destroying most of the barracks. Gunner Hains was killed. It was concluded that he had killed himself by firing a [[Cartridge (firearm)|ball cartridge]] down a ventilator shaft into the magazine which held 3 tons (3 tonnes) of gunpowder, causing the magazine to explode.<ref name =bijl>van der Bijl, Nicholas [[British Empire Medal|BEM]] (2000).

The fort is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].\n\n====Greater London====\n=====The Tower=====\nAs early as 1461, the [[Tower of London]] included a 'powderhous' within its walls. With the establishment of the [[Board of Ordnance]] there, its use as a gunpowder store increased. In the Tudor period the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] was refitted for this purpose, and by 1657 the entire building, apart from the chapel, was being used to store gunpowder.<ref>Parnell, Geoffrey (1993), The Tower of London, Batsford, {{ISBN|978-0-7134-6864-9}}</ref> Gunpowder was still being stored there when the Ordnance Board was disbanded in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\n=====Beckton=====\n[[File:Operations at the Scene of the Disaster - Funnel of Princess Alice in the Barge.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Talbot'' at Beckton, London]]\n{{HMS|Talbot|1824|6}} was moored in the Thames at [[Beckton]] as a powder magazine in the late 19th century.\n\n=====Tilbury, Essex, and Gravesend, Kent=====\nThe Board of Ordnance maintained Magazines at both [[Tilbury Fort]] and [[New Tavern Fort]], which face each other across the River Thames. Two sizeable Magazines of 1716 remain in place at Tilbury.\n\n=====Purfleet, Essex and Greenwich, Kent=====\n[[File:The Royal Gunpowder Magazine, Purfleet - geograph.org.uk - 607616.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Gunpowder Magazine No. 5, [[Purfleet]], Essex]]\n[[Purfleet]] Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established by Act of Parliament in 1760, built to the design of [[James Gabriel Montresor]] and opened in 1765, with a garrison in place to protect it.<ref name=\"listed building report\">[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-119622-government-powder-magazine- listed building report]</ref> Previously, gunpowder had been stored on [[Greenwich Peninsula]],<ref>[http://greenwichpeninsulahistory.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/the-powder-magazine-near-greenwich/]</ref> but fears of an explosion there prompted the building of this new establishment further afield. The purpose of Purfleet was to store newly manufactured gunpowder, prior to its distribution elsewhere.\n\nPurfleet was centred on five large magazines, each one capable of holding up to 10,400 barrels of gunpowder. These substantial brick-built sheds were windowless, with copper-lined doors and sand-filled roof voids \u2013 all designed to prevent (or mitigate the effects of) an explosion.<ref>[http://www.thurrock-history.org.uk/purfleet.html Thurrock Local History Society]</ref> By the end of the eighteenth century, Purfleet was receiving regular consignments of powder from [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Waltham Abbey]], to provide both the Navy and the Army with supplies.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence finally closed and sold the site in 1962, and several buildings were demolished to make way for a new housing estate. Some significant original buildings remain, however: the clock tower, the proofing house (in which samples of new consignments were tested) and one magazine. This magazine, No. 5, has been designated a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and now houses the Purfleet Heritage and Military Centre, a vast collection of local and military memorabilia open to the public.<ref>[http://www.purfleet-heritage.com/index.html Purfleet Heritage & Military Centre]</ref> According to [[English Heritage]], it represents (along with the magazine at [[Priddy's Hard]] in [[Gosport]]) \"the most outstanding example of a typically British type of magazine, with twin barrel vaults, that relates to a critical period in Britain's growth as a naval power in the decades after the Seven Years' War.\" Inside, a good number of original features have survived, including some unique wooden overhead cranes, early forerunners of the [[gantry crane]].<ref name=\"listed building report\"/>\n\n=====Hyde Park=====\n[[File:The Old Magazine, Hyde Park.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Magazine, Hyde Park]]\nA sizeable magazine stands in the unexpected surroundings of London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Opened by the Board of Ordnance in 1805, its structure is similar to other British magazines of this period except for the fact that the exterior is more ornamented here than elsewhere (probably in deference to its setting) with a Palladian style portico and other features.<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-406527-the-magazine-non-civil-parish-greater-lo Listed building information]</ref> The magazine provided the army with a stock of gunpowder in the capital, in case of 'foreign invasion or popular uprising'. It remained in [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] hands until 1963, after which it served as a storage facility. Since 2013 it has had a new lease of life, having been refurbished and extended by Dame [[Zaha Hadid]], as the [[Serpentine Gallery|Serpentine Sackler Gallery]].<ref>[http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2011/04/serpentine_sackler_gallery.html Gallery website: history and future plans]</ref>\n\n====Plymouth====\nIn Plymouth the Board of Ordnance set up Powder Magazines to serve the fleet and defences of [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] initially at the [[Royal Citadel, Plymouth|Royal Citadel]] (later supplemented by a small magazine at the New Gun Wharf (Morice Yard) in 1720); but space was limited and people were living close by, so the Board sought a new, more isolated spot for its Magazines. They first settled on a site at [[Keyham, Devon|Keyham]] Point (just north of Morice Yard) in 1775; but with that land required for an expansion of the Dockyard in the mid-19th century a new site was acquired further to the north, at Bull Point.\n\n=====Morice Yard, Devonport=====\nA magazine of 1744 survives ''in situ'' at Morice Yard (which today forms part of [[HMNB Devonport]]). Built to replace the earlier small magazine, which stood at the centre of the site, this is Britain's oldest surviving naval ordnance magazine.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1378553|accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====RNAD Bull Point=====\n[[File:Entrance to Bull Point Barracks - geograph.org.uk - 1709153.jpg|thumbnail|Bull Point Barracks\nGatehouse]]\nThe Royal Navy Ordnance Base (later [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|RNAD]]) Bull Point was the last great work of the [[Board of Ordnance]]\nbefore its disbandment in 1856. Bull Point was and is unusual in the unity and precise purpose of its design: rather than developing gradually over time, it was planned as a whole, and with a particular view to meeting the storage needs of emerging new types of artillery. Four Magazines were built (1851\u201354) each holding 10,000 barrels. These were followed by a series of other buildings specifically designed for particular uses. From the start, the site was fully integrated with the adjacent [[St Budeaux]] Royal Powder Works on Kinterbury Creek (established in 1805), where damaged powder was treated before being passed on to Bull Point for storage.\n\nThe buildings are mostly still in place within the MOD Bull Point RNAD site: all of one style, mostly ashlar with rock-faced dressings, they are said by English Heritage to comprise \"both the finest ensemble in any of the Ordnance Yards and a remarkable example of integrated factory planning of the period\".<ref>[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/.../thematic-survey-ordnance.pdf English Heritage National Survey of Ordnance Yards and Magazine Depots, pp40-46]</ref>\n\n====Portsmouth====\n=====Square Tower=====\nBuilding work on the [[Square Tower]], [[Portsmouth]], started in 1494; and from the end of the 16th century until 1779 it was used as a powder magazine, with a capacity of 12,000 barrels of gunpowder.<ref name=sadden>Sadden, John (2001). ''Portsmouth: In Defence of the Realm''. Chichester: Phillimore & Co. {{ISBN|1-86077-165-3}}.</ref>\n\nThe inhabitants of Portsmouth petitioned the [[Master General of the Ordnance]] in 1716 to remove the gunpowder, as they were worried about the hazards it posed to the town, but nothing was done at that time. A further petition was sent to the [[Board of Ordnance]] in 1767 following an explosion which caused extensive damage.  This led to the construction of the Priddy's Hard magazine at [[Gosport]] (see below), in a remote area, across the water from Portsmouth.\n\nThe Square Tower still exists. After 1779 it was used for other purposes; including employment as a [[semaphore line|semaphore station]] in 1817.<ref name=sadden/>\n\n=====Priddy's Hard, Gosport=====\n[[File:Museum of Naval Firepower, Gosport-geograph.org.uk-2992669.jpg|thumbnail|The 18th-century 'A' Magazine at Priddy's Hard]]\n{{Main|Priddy's Hard}}\nPriddy's Hard began life as Priddy's Hard [[Fort]]; however in 1768 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] authorised the construction of a gunpowder magazine inside the ramparts to avoid having to store gunpowder in the Square Tower, [[Portsmouth]]. Construction was begun in 1771 and the magazine was in use by 1777. A cooperage and shifting house were built alongside at the same time, together with a 'rolling way' for moving gunpowder barrels between the magazine and a nearby wharf; together with the Magazine they are all [[Grade I listed]] structures.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1276026|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1393247|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoth the fort and the magazine came under the control of the [[Board of Ordnance]] until 1855; control passing, first to the [[War Office]], and then the [[Admiralty]] in 1891. Priddy's Hard became a Naval Armaments Depot, finally closing in 1977.<ref name=semark>Semark, H. W. (1997).

Museum of Naval Firepower]].\n\n=====Tipner Point=====\nIn the 1780s the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], [[Master General of the Ordnance]], began to implement a policy of dividing gunpowder stored at the principal coastal locations, and storing it across several sites in the vicinity (to make it less vulnerable to a targeted attack). At Portsmouth, this led to the building of a new magazine at [[Tipner]] Point in 1796\u20138. A second magazine was added in 1856 (part of a policy of expansion following the [[Crimean War]]); both still stand flanked by two buildings, the former cooperage and the shifting house, which, along with the magazines, are listed buildings.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1387240|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref> The magazines remained in use until the 1950s.

Movement of gunpowder barrels within the complex was by canal. Four more magazines were added in 1856, and by 1864 Marchwood was Britain's largest magazine complex with capacity for 76,000 barrels.<ref>[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/.../thematic-survey-ordnance.pdf English Heritage National Survey of Ordnance Yards and Magazine Depots, pp 50\u201352.]</ref>\n\nTwo magazines have survived (one of 1814\u201316, one of 1856) along with some ancillary buildings (one of which is now home to Marchwood Yacht Club).<ref>[http://www.newforest.gov.uk/article/14333/Royal-Naval-Armaments-Depot-Marchwood New Forest Council website]</ref> None of the other magazines has survived, mainly due to the damage that was sustained across the site during [[The Blitz]].

Thenceforward, barrels of gunpowder were transferred to Upnor, primarily from the [[Tower of London]]. The castle was recognized as unsuitable for this role as early as 1808 when a new magazine (since demolished) was built on an adjacent site; another, of similar design, was added in 1857.<ref name=\"helm.org.uk\">[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/.../thematic-survey-ordnance.pdf English Heritage National Survey of Ordnance Yards and Magazine Depots]</ref> The latter, which still stands, is described as 'a particularly fine magazine building of the 1850s, distinguished by its historicist style' and 'the most impressive example of a magazine using the catenary arch system'.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1393292|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n \nIn 1877, five more new magazines were built inland at [[Chattenden]] (the two sites being linked by a [[Chattenden and Upnor Railway|railway]]). Still more magazines were built close by at Lodge Hill, from 1898, primarily for storing the recently developed explosive [[cordite]].

Each magazine is separated from its neighbour by an earth-filled 'traverse' building, designed to absorb the impact of an explosion \u2013 the first time large magazines had been provided with traverses. Like all the main buildings at Weedon, the magazines lie along the bank of a branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] for ease of transport.

The saltpetre derived from deposits in byres, stables and doocots would be stored in the Powder House.\n\nPlans for rebuilding it were made in 1781, at the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and accomplished by 1801; its use was discontinued in 1880.<ref name=\"Strawhorn\">Strawhorn, John (1985).

They were sold off by the government in 1832, in a semi-derelict condition; but were bought by a [[Liverpool]] merchant and were reopened to manufacture gunpowder; finally closing, just over a century ago, in 1903.

It usually carried about 273&nbsp;kg gunpowder, 7,000 ball cartridges and 60 rifles as stock.  In 1870 the British Military built a powder magazine in the Northern Cape town of [[Fraserburg]] (also still standing) in case of war with the neighbouring [[Griqua people]] and subsequently used in the [[Anglo-Boer War]].\n\n==In the United Kingdom==\n[[File:Tilbury Fort, Essex - geograph.org.uk - 794674.jpg|thumb|left|Tilbury: a unique pair of early 18th-century magazines within the Fort]]\nProduction of gunpowder in England appears to have started in the mid-13th century with the aim of supplying [[The Crown]].<ref name=cocroft-1>Cocroft (2000). Chapter 1: \"Success to the Black Art!\".</ref> Records show that gunpowder was being made in 1346, at the [[Tower of London]]; a [[powder house]] existed at the Tower in 1461.<ref name =cocroft-1/> Gunpowder was also being made or stored at other royal residences such as [[Greenwich Palace]] (the reason being that these were where the royal armouries were based). It was also stored in [[Scotland]], in royal castles, such as [[Edinburgh Castle]]. Gunpowder manufacture at [[Faversham explosives industry|Faversham]] began as a private enterprise in the 16th century.\n\nFrom the 18th century, efforts began to be made to site magazines away from inhabited areas. Nevertheless, storage at the older established sites persisted well into the 19th century.\n\nThe use of gunpowder for both military and civil engineering purposes began to be superseded by newer [[nitrogen]]-based [[Explosive material|explosives]] from the later 19th century. Gunpowder production in the United Kingdom was gradually phased out during the mid-20th century. The last remaining gunpowder mill at the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey]] was damaged by a German [[Land mine|parachute mine]] in 1941 and it never reopened.<ref name =cocroft-4>Cocroft (2000). Chapter 4: \"The demise of gunpowder\".</ref> This was followed by the closure of the gunpowder section at the [[Royal Ordnance Factory]], [[ROF Chorley]], the section was closed and demolished at the end of World War II, and [[Nobel Enterprises|ICI Nobel's]] [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] gunpowder factory which closed in 1954.<ref name =cocroft-4/> This left the sole United Kingdom gunpowder factory at ICI Nobel's Ardeer site in [[North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]]; it too closed in October 1976.<ref name =cocroft-4/> Since then gunpowder has been imported into the United Kingdom.\n\nGunpowder magazines survive at several locations in the UK. It can be seen that, in many cases, the gunpowder was stored in locations which were both remote from habitations and could be made secure. They were also often sited in dense woodland (or had trees planted around them) as a way of lessening the effect of any explosion.\n\n===In England===\n\n====Berwick-upon-Tweed====\n[[File:Gunpowder magazine, Berwick-upon-Tweed - geograph.org.uk - 1351482.jpg|thumbnail|Gunpowder magazine, Berwick]]\nThe Gunpowder Magazine in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] was built in 1745 to service [[Berwick Barracks]] and sited at a safe distance from them to the south. It is a solid stone building, heavily buttressed, windowless, stone roofed and enclosed by a stone wall. Along with Purfleet and Tilbury it is one of the few surviving eighteenth-century gunpowder magazines in the country.\n\n====Brean Down Fort, Somerset====\n{{Main|Brean Down Fort}}\nBrean Down Fort was one of a number of ''[[Palmerston Forts]]'' built to defend the British, Irish and Channel Island coastlines. It was originally built in stages between 1862 and 1870; to protect the [[Bristol Channel]].  It had a large, underground, main gunpowder magazine, 15-foot (4.5 m) by 18-foot (5.5 m) by 20-foot (6.1 m) high, built to the recommendations of the 1863 [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom|Royal Commission]]. The magazine still exists. A further two, smaller, underground magazines, ''No. 2 magazine'' and ''No. 3 magazine'', were also built. No. 3 magazine exploded on 3 July 1900 destroying most of the barracks. Gunner Hains was killed. It was concluded that he had killed himself by firing a [[Cartridge (firearm)|ball cartridge]] down a ventilator shaft into the magazine which held 3 tons (3 tonnes) of gunpowder, causing the magazine to explode.<ref name =bijl>van der Bijl, Nicholas [[British Empire Medal|BEM]] (2000).

The fort is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].\n\n====Greater London====\n=====The Tower=====\nAs early as 1461, the [[Tower of London]] included a 'powderhous' within its walls. With the establishment of the [[Board of Ordnance]] there, its use as a gunpowder store increased. In the Tudor period the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] was refitted for this purpose, and by 1657 the entire building, apart from the chapel, was being used to store gunpowder.<ref>Parnell, Geoffrey (1993), The Tower of London, Batsford, {{ISBN|978-0-7134-6864-9}}</ref> Gunpowder was still being stored there when the Ordnance Board was disbanded in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\n=====Beckton=====\n[[File:Operations at the Scene of the Disaster - Funnel of Princess Alice in the Barge.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Talbot'' at Beckton, London]]\n{{HMS|Talbot|1824|6}} was moored in the Thames at [[Beckton]] as a powder magazine in the late 19th century.\n\n=====Tilbury, Essex, and Gravesend, Kent=====\nThe Board of Ordnance maintained Magazines at both [[Tilbury Fort]] and [[New Tavern Fort]], which face each other across the River Thames. Two sizeable Magazines of 1716 remain in place at Tilbury.\n\n=====Purfleet, Essex and Greenwich, Kent=====\n[[File:The Royal Gunpowder Magazine, Purfleet - geograph.org.uk - 607616.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Gunpowder Magazine No. 5, [[Purfleet]], Essex]]\n[[Purfleet]] Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established by Act of Parliament in 1760, built to the design of [[James Gabriel Montresor]] and opened in 1765, with a garrison in place to protect it.<ref name=\"listed building report\">[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-119622-government-powder-magazine- listed building report]</ref> Previously, gunpowder had been stored on [[Greenwich Peninsula]],<ref>[http://greenwichpeninsulahistory.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/the-powder-magazine-near-greenwich/]</ref> but fears of an explosion there prompted the building of this new establishment further afield. The purpose of Purfleet was to store newly manufactured gunpowder, prior to its distribution elsewhere.\n\nPurfleet was centred on five large magazines, each one capable of holding up to 10,400 barrels of gunpowder. These substantial brick-built sheds were windowless, with copper-lined doors and sand-filled roof voids \u2013 all designed to prevent (or mitigate the effects of) an explosion.<ref>[http://www.thurrock-history.org.uk/purfleet.html Thurrock Local History Society]</ref> By the end of the eighteenth century, Purfleet was receiving regular consignments of powder from [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Waltham Abbey]], to provide both the Navy and the Army with supplies.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence finally closed and sold the site in 1962, and several buildings were demolished to make way for a new housing estate. Some significant original buildings remain, however: the clock tower, the proofing house (in which samples of new consignments were tested) and one magazine. This magazine, No. 5, has been designated a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and now houses the Purfleet Heritage and Military Centre, a vast collection of local and military memorabilia open to the public.<ref>[http://www.purfleet-heritage.com/index.html Purfleet Heritage & Military Centre]</ref> According to [[English Heritage]], it represents (along with the magazine at [[Priddy's Hard]] in [[Gosport]]) \"the most outstanding example of a typically British type of magazine, with twin barrel vaults, that relates to a critical period in Britain's growth as a naval power in the decades after the Seven Years' War.\" Inside, a good number of original features have survived, including some unique wooden overhead cranes, early forerunners of the [[gantry crane]].<ref name=\"listed building report\"/>\n\n=====Hyde Park=====\n[[File:The Old Magazine, Hyde Park.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Magazine, Hyde Park]]\nA sizeable magazine stands in the unexpected surroundings of London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Opened by the Board of Ordnance in 1805, its structure is similar to other British magazines of this period except for the fact that the exterior is more ornamented here than elsewhere (probably in deference to its setting) with a Palladian style portico and other features.<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-406527-the-magazine-non-civil-parish-greater-lo Listed building information]</ref> The magazine provided the army with a stock of gunpowder in the capital, in case of 'foreign invasion or popular uprising'. It remained in [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] hands until 1963, after which it served as a storage facility. Since 2013 it has had a new lease of life, having been refurbished and extended by Dame [[Zaha Hadid]], as the [[Serpentine Gallery|Serpentine Sackler Gallery]].<ref>[http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2011/04/serpentine_sackler_gallery.html Gallery website: history and future plans]</ref>\n\n====Plymouth====\nIn Plymouth the Board of Ordnance set up Powder Magazines to serve the fleet and defences of [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] initially at the [[Royal Citadel, Plymouth|Royal Citadel]] (later supplemented by a small magazine at the New Gun Wharf (Morice Yard) in 1720); but space was limited and people were living close by, so the Board sought a new, more isolated spot for its Magazines. They first settled on a site at [[Keyham, Devon|Keyham]] Point (just north of Morice Yard) in 1775; but with that land required for an expansion of the Dockyard in the mid-19th century a new site was acquired further to the north, at Bull Point.\n\n=====Morice Yard, Devonport=====\nA magazine of 1744 survives ''in situ'' at Morice Yard (which today forms part of [[HMNB Devonport]]). Built to replace the earlier small magazine, which stood at the centre of the site, this is Britain's oldest surviving naval ordnance magazine.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1378553|accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====RNAD Bull Point=====\n[[File:Entrance to Bull Point Barracks - geograph.org.uk - 1709153.jpg|thumbnail|Bull Point Barracks\nGatehouse]]\nThe Royal Navy Ordnance Base (later [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|RNAD]]) Bull Point was the last great work of the [[Board of Ordnance]]\nbefore its disbandment in 1856. Bull Point was and is unusual in the unity and precise purpose of its design: rather than developing gradually over time, it was planned as a whole, and with a particular view to meeting the storage needs of emerging new types of artillery. Four Magazines were built (1851\u201354) each holding 10,000 barrels. These were followed by a series of other buildings specifically designed for particular uses. From the start, the site was fully integrated with the adjacent [[St Budeaux]] Royal Powder Works on Kinterbury Creek (established in 1805), where damaged powder was treated before being passed on to Bull Point for storage.\n\nThe buildings are mostly still in place within the MOD Bull Point RNAD site: all of one style, mostly ashlar with rock-faced dressings, they are said by English Heritage to comprise \"both the finest ensemble in any of the Ordnance Yards and a remarkable example of integrated factory planning of the period\".<ref>[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/.../thematic-survey-ordnance.pdf English Heritage National Survey of Ordnance Yards and Magazine Depots, pp40-46]</ref>\n\n====Portsmouth====\n=====Square Tower=====\nBuilding work on the [[Square Tower]], [[Portsmouth]], started in 1494; and from the end of the 16th century until 1779 it was used as a powder magazine, with a capacity of 12,000 barrels of gunpowder.<ref name=sadden>Sadden, John (2001). ''Portsmouth: In Defence of the Realm''. Chichester: Phillimore & Co. {{ISBN|1-86077-165-3}}.</ref>\n\nThe inhabitants of Portsmouth petitioned the [[Master General of the Ordnance]] in 1716 to remove the gunpowder, as they were worried about the hazards it posed to the town, but nothing was done at that time. A further petition was sent to the [[Board of Ordnance]] in 1767 following an explosion which caused extensive damage.  This led to the construction of the Priddy's Hard magazine at [[Gosport]] (see below), in a remote area, across the water from Portsmouth.\n\nThe Square Tower still exists. After 1779 it was used for other purposes; including employment as a [[semaphore line|semaphore station]] in 1817.<ref name=sadden/>\n\n=====Priddy's Hard, Gosport=====\n[[File:Museum of Naval Firepower, Gosport-geograph.org.uk-2992669.jpg|thumbnail|The 18th-century 'A' Magazine at Priddy's Hard]]\n{{Main|Priddy's Hard}}\nPriddy's Hard began life as Priddy's Hard [[Fort]]; however in 1768 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] authorised the construction of a gunpowder magazine inside the ramparts to avoid having to store gunpowder in the Square Tower, [[Portsmouth]]. Construction was begun in 1771 and the magazine was in use by 1777. A cooperage and shifting house were built alongside at the same time, together with a 'rolling way' for moving gunpowder barrels between the magazine and a nearby wharf; together with the Magazine they are all [[Grade I listed]] structures.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1276026|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1393247|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoth the fort and the magazine came under the control of the [[Board of Ordnance]] until 1855; control passing, first to the [[War Office]], and then the [[Admiralty]] in 1891.

Museum of Naval Firepower]].\n\n=====Tipner Point=====\nIn the 1780s the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], [[Master General of the Ordnance]], began to implement a policy of dividing gunpowder stored at the principal coastal locations, and storing it across several sites in the vicinity (to make it less vulnerable to a targeted attack). At Portsmouth, this led to the building of a new magazine at [[Tipner]] Point in 1796\u20138. A second magazine was added in 1856 (part of a policy of expansion following the [[Crimean War]]); both still stand flanked by two buildings, the former cooperage and the shifting house, which, along with the magazines, are listed buildings.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1387240|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref> The magazines remained in use until the 1950s. The surrounding land is earmarked for future redevelopment as part of the Tipner Regeneration scheme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Portsmouth City Council website|url=https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/ext/development-and-planning/regeneration/tipner-regeneration.aspx}}</ref>\n\n=====Marchwood=====\nAnother magazine depot for Portsmouth was established at [[Marchwood]], where three magazines were built in 1814\u201316 to an innovative design by [[Sir William Congreve, 1st Baronet|Sir William Congreve]]. Movement of gunpowder barrels within the complex was by canal. Four more magazines were added in 1856, and by 1864 Marchwood was Britain's largest magazine complex with capacity for 76,000 barrels.<ref>[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/.../thematic-survey-ordnance.pdf English Heritage National Survey of Ordnance Yards and Magazine Depots, pp 50\u201352.]</ref>\n\nTwo magazines have survived (one of 1814\u201316, one of 1856) along with some ancillary buildings (one of which is now home to Marchwood Yacht Club).<ref>[http://www.newforest.gov.uk/article/14333/Royal-Naval-Armaments-Depot-Marchwood New Forest Council website]</ref> None of the other magazines has survived, mainly due to the damage that was sustained across the site during [[The Blitz]]. The depot closed in 1961; the site is now primarily a residential area.\n\n==== Sedgeford, Norfolk ====\n[[Image:MagazineCottage.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Magazine, the old gunpowder store at Sedgeford]]\nMagazine Cottage in [[Sedgeford]] was built during the 17th century by the Le Strange Family as a gunpowder store during the [[English Civil War]].<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1077931|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref> It is now a residential house and a landmark for the many walkers of the ancient Roman road [[Peddars Way]]; it is said that a secret passageway led from the house to the coast.\n\n====Upnor Castle, Kent====\n[[File:Thames Barge off Upnor Castle.jpg|thumbnail|left|Magazine of 1857 (centre) alongside Upnor Castle (left)]]\nIn 1668, following the Dutch [[Raid on the Medway]], [[Upnor Castle]] was reassigned from serving as an artillery fort to be 'a Place of Store and Magazine'. Thenceforward, barrels of gunpowder were transferred to Upnor, primarily from the [[Tower of London]]. The castle was recognized as unsuitable for this role as early as 1808 when a new magazine (since demolished) was built on an adjacent site; another, of similar design, was added in 1857.<ref name=\"helm.org.uk\">[http://www.helm.org.uk/guidance-library/.../thematic-survey-ordnance.pdf English Heritage National Survey of Ordnance Yards and Magazine Depots]</ref> The latter, which still stands, is described as 'a particularly fine magazine building of the 1850s, distinguished by its historicist style' and 'the most impressive example of a magazine using the catenary arch system'.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=|num=1393292|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n \nIn 1877, five more new magazines were built inland at [[Chattenden]] (the two sites being linked by a [[Chattenden and Upnor Railway|railway]]). Still more magazines were built close by at Lodge Hill, from 1898, primarily for storing the recently developed explosive [[cordite]]. [[Upnor#The Military|Upnor]], [[Chattenden and Lodge Hill Military Camps|Chattenden and Lodge Hill depots]] remained in military ownership until the mid-2010s, when the MOD marketed the land for housing and commercial use.<ref>[http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/SOM%20Lodge%20Hill%202012.

The magazines stand in their own compound apart from the main storehouses within a containing wall. Each magazine is separated from its neighbour by an earth-filled 'traverse' building, designed to absorb the impact of an explosion \u2013 the first time large magazines had been provided with traverses. Like all the main buildings at Weedon, the magazines lie along the bank of a branch of the [[Grand Union Canal]] for ease of transport. In 1827 the four magazines contained 10,500 barrels of powder, along with 1,463,700 ball and 693,746 blank cartridges.<ref name=\"helm.org.uk\"/>\n\n====Arkengarthdale, North Yorkshire====\nA hexagonal gunpowder magazine still stands near the ruins of the Charles Bathurst Smelt Mill in [[Arkengarthdale]], [[North Yorkshire]]. It stored gunpowder for use in the numerous lead workings in the area and was last used as a candle factory. All lead working in the dale ceased around 1911.\n\n===In Scotland===\n[[Image:Powdermagazine1.jpg|thumb|right|<center>The remote situation of a gunpowder magazine near Kilmarnock in 1819.

Kilmarnock.</ref></center>]]\n\n====Ayrshire====\nThe remains of old storage magazines are prominent in the landscape around the old Nobel's Explosives site in Ayrshire, many protected by large earth banks which acted as blast walls; these are not all gunpowder magazines, as the site has long been associated with other explosives, particularly [[dynamite]] and [[ballistite]].\n\n====Barkip====\nA gunpowder magazine was located near the site of the Low Well in the village of [[Barkip]], also known as The Den, near [[Beith]], North Ayrshire.\n\n====Beith====\nAn explosives magazine at the old Hessilhead limestone Quarry near [[Beith]] in [[North Ayrshire]] had a small section for [[blasting caps]] and a larger section for the sticks of [[Dynamite]].\n\n===Culzean Castle===\nA restored powder house at Culzean Castle stands close to the sea cliffs. It was used to store gunpowder for the battery and for the 8am daily cannon shot.\n\n====Dockra magazines====\nDockra limestone quarry lies between [[Barrmill]], [[Broadstone, North Ayrshire|Broadstone]] and [[Gateside, North Ayrshire|Gateside]] and had two gunpowder magazines; the older one was built some distance from the works. The quarries closed before WW2.\n<gallery>\nFile:Dockra Powder House internal detail, Barrmill.JPG|Internal detail\nFile:Dockra powder house door, Barrmill.JPG|The door\nFile:Powder House, Dockra - lock detail, Barrmill.JPG|Detail of locking mechanism\nFile:Powder house at Dockra quarry.JPG|The gunpowder magazine\n</gallery>\n\n====Dumbarton castle====\n{{Main|Dumbarton Castle}}\n[[File:Dumbarton Rock, the Magazine - geograph.org.uk - 1381466.jpg|left|thumb|Dumbarton Castle magazine]]\nDumbarton Castle contained two powder magazines; both located high up on Dumbarton Rock. The oldest went out of use in 1748, being replaced by a new Magazine designed by William Skinner. The new magazine, located on ''The Beak'', has a [[barrel-vault]]ed roof, with double doors and indirect ventilation. It was designed to hold 150 barrels.<ref name=macivor>MacIvor, Iain (1981).

The ''Grand Magazine'' was designed to hold 2,500 barrels of gunpowder. It was constructed between 1757 and 1759; and was built strong enough to withstand a direct hit from a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]. It has a [[slate]] roof laid on [[brick]] vaults, which sit on stone pillars. To prevent sparks, no iron fittings are used in the magazine: the wooden floor is held by wooden dowels; and the doors and shutters sheathed with [[copper]] sheet.<ref name=macivor-96>MacIvor, Iain (1996).

[[James VI]], of Scotland, had instructed that all [[Royal burghs]] should have powder magazines. The saltpetre derived from deposits in byres, stables and doocots would be stored in the Powder House.\n\nPlans for rebuilding it were made in 1781, at the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and accomplished by 1801; its use was discontinued in 1880.<ref name=\"Strawhorn\">Strawhorn, John (1985).

{"title_page": "Fiber-reinforced concrete", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}\n\n'''Fiber-reinforced concrete''' ('''FRC''') is [[concrete]] containing fibrous material which increases its structural integrity. It contains short discrete [[fiber]]s that are uniformly distributed and randomly oriented. Fibers include steel fibers, [[Glass fiber reinforced concrete|glass fibers]], [[synthetic fiber]]s and [[natural fiber]]s \u2013 each of which lend varying properties to the concrete. In addition, the character of fiber-reinforced concrete changes with varying concretes, fiber materials, geometries, distribution, orientation, and densities.\n\n==Historical perspective==\n\nThe concept of using fibers as reinforcement is not new. Fibers have been used as reinforcement since ancient times. Historically, [[horsehair]] was used in [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[straw]] in [[mudbrick]]s. In the 1900s, [[asbestos]] fibers were used in concrete. In the 1950s, the concept of [[composite material]]s came into being and fiber-reinforced concrete was one of the topics of interest. Once the [[carcinogen|health risks]] associated with asbestos were discovered, there was a need to find a replacement for the substance in concrete and other building materials. By the 1960s, [[steel]], [[glass]] ([[Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete (GFRC)|GFRC]]), and synthetic (such as [[polypropylene]]) fibers were used in concrete. Research into new fiber-reinforced concretes continues today.\n\n==Effect of fibers in concrete==\n\nFibers are usually used in concrete to control cracking due to [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] shrinkage and to drying shrinkage. They also reduce the [[permeability (fluid)|permeability]] of concrete and thus reduce bleeding of [[water]]. Some types of fibers produce greater impact\u2013, abrasion\u2013, and shatter\u2013resistance in concrete. Generally fibers do not increase the flexural [[Strength of materials|strength]] of concrete, and so cannot replace [[moment (physics)|moment]]\u2013resisting or [[structural steel]] reinforcement.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Indeed, some fibers actually reduce the strength of concrete.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe amount of fibers added to a concrete mix is expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the composite (concrete and fibers), termed \"volume fraction\" (V<sub>f</sub>). V<sub>f</sub> typically ranges from 0.1 to 3%. The aspect ratio (l/d) is calculated by dividing fiber length (l) by its diameter (d). Fibers with a non-circular cross section use an equivalent diameter for the calculation of aspect ratio. If the fiber's [[modulus of elasticity]] is higher than the matrix (concrete or [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] binder), they help to carry the load by increasing the tensile strength of the material. Increasing the aspect ratio of the fiber usually segments the flexural strength and toughness of the matrix. However, fibers that are too long tend to \"ball\" in the mix and create workability problems.\n\nSome research in the late 2000s indicated that using fibers in concrete has limited effect on the impact resistance of the materials.<ref name=\"adfil.co.uk\"/><ref name=michigan/> This finding is very important since traditionally, people think that ductility increases when concrete is reinforced with fibers. The results also indicated that the use of micro fibers offers better impact resistance to that of longer fibers.<ref name=\"adfil.co.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adfil.co.uk/docs/templates/news.asp?monthid=6&yearid=2004 |title=News - Fibres add much needed protection to prestigious tunnelling projects |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2017-02-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927074710/http://www.adfil.co.uk/docs/templates/news.asp?monthid=6&yearid=2004 |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[High Speed 1]] tunnel linings incorporated concrete containing 1&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3 of polypropylene fibers, of diameter 18 & 32&nbsp;\u03bcm, giving the benefits noted below.<ref name=\"adfil.co.uk\"/>\n\n==Benefits==\n\nGlass fibers can:\n* Improve concrete strength at low cost.\n* Adds tensile reinforcement in all directions, unlike rebar.\n* Add a decorative look as they are visible in the finished concrete surface.\n\n[[Polypropylene]] and [[nylon]] fibers can:\n*Improve mix cohesion, improving pumpability over long distances\n*Improve freeze-thaw resistance\n*Improve resistance to explosive [[spalling]] in case of a severe fire\n*Improve impact\u2013 and abrasion\u2013resistance\n*Increase resistance to plastic shrinkage during curing\n*Improve structural strength\n*Reduce steel reinforcement requirements\n*Improve [[ductility]]\n*Reduce crack widths and control the crack widths tightly, thus improving durability\n\n[[Steel]] fibers can:\n*Improve structural strength\n*Reduce steel reinforcement requirements\n*Reduce crack widths and control the crack widths tightly, thus improving durability\n*Improve impact\u2013 and abrasion\u2013resistance\n*Improve freeze-thaw resistance\n\nBlends of both steel and polymeric fibers are often used in construction projects in order to combine the benefits of both products; structural improvements provided by steel fibers and the resistance to explosive [[spalling]] and plastic shrinkage improvements provided by polymeric fibers.\n\nIn certain specific circumstances, steel fiber or macro synthetic fibers can entirely replace traditional steel reinforcement bar (\"[[rebar]]\") in reinforced concrete.

There are increasing numbers of tunnelling projects using precast lining segments reinforced only with steel fibers.\n\nMicro-Rebar has also been recently tested and approved to replace traditional reinforcement in vertical walls designed in accordance with ACI 318 Chapter 14.<ref>http://www.core-construction-products.com/pdfs/ACI-318-IBC-IRC-Evaluation-report-Helix-Steel-Micro-Rebar-Alternative-to-Steel-Rebar-Concrete-reinforcement-Vertical-Applications.pdf</ref>\n\n==Some developments==\n\nAn FRC sub-category named High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC) claims 500 times more resistance to cracking and 40 percent lighter than traditional concrete.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} HPFRC claims it can sustain strain-hardening up to several percent strain, resulting in a material [[ductility]] of at least two orders of magnitude higher when compared to normal concrete or standard fiber-reinforced concrete. HPFRC also claims a unique cracking behavior. When loaded to beyond the elastic range, HPFRC maintains crack width to below 100&nbsp;\u00b5m, even when deformed to several percent tensile strains. Field results with HPFRC and The Michigan Department of Transportation resulted in early-age cracking.<ref name=michigan>{{citation | last=Li | first=V. | last2=Yang |first2=E. |last3=Li |first3= M. |title = Field Demonstration of Durable Link Slabs for Jointless Bridge Decks Based on Strain-Hardening Cementitious Composites \u2013 Phase 3: Shrinkage Control | publisher = Michigan Department of Transportation |date = 28 January 2008\n| url = http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdot/MDOT_Research_Report_RC-1506_232611_7.pdf}}</ref>\n\nRecent studies performed on a high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete in a bridge deck found that adding fibers provided residual strength and controlled cracking.<ref>{{citation | publisher = American Concrete Institute | title = ACI 544.3R-93: Guide for Specifying, Proportioning, Mixing, Placing, and Finishing Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete | year=1998}}</ref> There were fewer and narrower cracks in the FRC even though the FRC had more shrinkage than the control.

Communism of Kerala has provided Indian communist stalwarts such as [[M. N. Govindan Nair]], [[C. Achutha Menon]], [[T. V. Thomas]], [[P. K. Vasudevan Nair]], [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], [[C. K. Chandrappan]] and [[A. K. Gopalan]].\n\nToday the two largest [[Communist party|communist parties]] in Kerala politics are the [[Communist Party of India]] and the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (which split from the Communist Party of India in 1964). The [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]] is a coalition of [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Political party|political parties]] in the state of Kerala and is one of the two major political coalitions in Kerala, each of which have been in power alternatively for the last two decades. The coalition consists of the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)]], the [[Janata Dal (Secular)]], the [[Nationalist Congress Party]], the [[Indian National League]], the [[Kerala Congress (Anti-merger Group)]], and the [[Indian National Congress (Socialist)]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation of a socialist wing===\n[[File:Kerala communist tableaux.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A [[tableau vivant|tableau]] in a communist rally in [[Kerala]], [[India]], of a young farmer and worker.]]\nAn important feature of the anti-Colonial struggles in [[Malabar district]], [[Cochin Kingdom]] and [[Travancore Kingdom]] (these three regions will later form [[Kerala state]], along with some regions from [[South Kanara]]) in the 1920s and 1930s was the increasing involvement of peasants and workers. The peasant and labour movements of the 1930s were to a great extent the cause as well as the consequence of the emergence of a powerful left wing in politics. In 1934, the left anti-Colonials joined together and organized the Congress Socialist Party with C. K. Govindan Nair as Secretary within the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]].\n\nA powerful factor that helped the growth of the left movement was the support it received from the radical section of the anti-Colonial native Muslims in Malabar. Left groups started functioning in several parts of Malabar and soon the [[Kerala Provincial Congress Committee]] (KPCC) was dominated by them.\n\nIt was only by 1938-39 [[Malabar district]], [[Cochin Kingdom]] and [[Travancore Kingdom]] were fully drawn into the anti-British struggle for self-rule as well as the struggle for responsible Government in the Princely States. The leftists preferred to remain organizationally within the Congress and call themselves Socialists. Thus both the left and right groups joined together in order to ensure the success of the Congress candidates in the election of 1936 in Malabar district.\n\n===Birth of the Communist Party===\n[[File:E. M. S. Namboodiripad.jpg|120px|thumb|E.M.S. Namboodiripad]]\nBut the rift between the Indian National Congress and the Socialist wing came into the open with the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the resignation of the Congress ministries in the provinces and the starting of individual [[satyagraha]].\n\nThey were expelled from the Congress Socialist Party in March 1940, after allegations that the communists had disrupted party activities and were intent on coopting party organizations. Indeed, by the time the communists were expelled, they had gained control over the entire Congress Socialist Party units in what were to become the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe left-dominated Kerala Provincial Congress Committee, contrary to directive of the Congress, observed. The left wing met in secret enclave at Parapram, Pinarayi, near [[Thalassery]] and in December 1939, the Communist Party was born.\n\nIn 1957 the CPI was elected to rule the state government of Kerala only to have the government dismissed and President's Rule declared in 1959. In 1964, in conjunction with the widening rift between China and the Soviet Union, a large leftist faction of the CPI leadership, based predominantly in Kerala and West Bengal, split from the party to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M). In Kerala, the CPI (M) in coalition with other parties wrested control from the Congress and its allies (frequently including the CPI) in 1967, in 1980, and in 1987. Support for the CPI (M) in Kerala in general elections has ranged from 19 percent to 26 percent, but the party has never won more than nine of Kerala's twenty seats in Parliament. But as a coalition including CPI (M), CPI and other parties as Left Democratic Front they won 19 seats out of 20.\n\n==Communism in Practice==\n[[File:Communist flag @ Kottayam, Kerala, India (2).JPG|thumb|A communist flag in [[Kanjirappally]], [[Kerala]].]]\nThe Communist Party in Kerala is unique because it has functioned under the conditions of a liberal democracy, relying on success in multi-party elections to remain in power. Unlike many other communist governments, the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Kerala did not crush political dissent. CPI's 1957 constitution stated it would allow the existence of opposing parties after it had parliamentary majority. Party leaders, like Namboodiripad, did not like the idea of using military force to remain in power because it would reflect poorly on the CPI as a whole on a global stage. This reliance on the people's opinions created a benevolent communist government, but it also made it more difficult to enact radical reforms. Therefore, the reforms of the CPI in Kerala were mainly moderately socialist.<ref name=gould>{{cite book|first=Michael Austin|last=Gould|year=1965|title=Communism in Kerala|publisher=University of Chicago}}</ref>\n\n===Agrarian reform===\nOne of the major changes advocated by the CPI was the Agrarian Relations Bill, passed in 1961. The bill was intentionally moderate because those drafting it knew it would have to pass through many constitutional channels before it would be made into a law. Over 1,000 amendments were debated due to party divisions. Though the bill was moderate, it still changed the farming system. It abolished feudalism and aimed to create a capitalist agricultural system. The CPI did not push more radical Communist land reforms. Namboodiripad stated they would not attempt state ownership or collective farms because even though such ideas might appeal to intellectuals on a scientific basis, they would not actually help the peasantry in practice. The bill aimed to improve wages and working conditions as well as secure employment. Landlords were only allowed to work on their land if they paid compensation, which helped protect the tenants\u2019 rights.<ref name=gould/>\n\n===Administrative reform===\nThe CPI also wanted to reorganize its administrative structure. The administration was already undergoing changes after India gained independence and the local government in particular had new responsibilities. Rather than just tax collection, it had to focus more on development and welfare. In local government, the CPI promised less corruption, nepotism, political patronage, and inefficiency, which it planned to achieve through decentralization. Its main priority was building a socialist government. This required Congress's cooperation and the people's approval. In 1957 the party secretary, Govindan Nair, was concerned that the new government had still not improved the efficiency of the old administration. He used the newly created Administrative Reforms Committee to rectify this.<ref name=gould/>\n\nThe Committee was responsible for reviewing the existing administration and recommending new methods for coordinating governing bodies. It distributed a questionnaire concerning administrative machinery to over a thousand people, both within the government and outside of it. The CPI was seeking consensual reform rather than a drastic upheaval or consolidation of its own power. It wanted the cooperation of each governing body, down to the village level, to create a more efficient and democratic government. At the local level, the government relied the panchayat, or village council, to report on development and welfare.  The Block Advisory Committee was a step above the panchayat, which had advising responsibilities along with other independent powers. Overall, the changes the CPI made once it was in government can be characterized as \"Congress-socialist style reforms\". Though it was a communist party, like any democratically elected power, the CPI had to balance its loyalty to the people with its desire to expand and increase power.<ref name=gould/>\n\n===Industrial reform===\nAs the CPI in Kerala was ultimately controlled by the federal government, its state plan depended on the funds it could raise independently. It struggled to industrialize and develop new manufacturing plants in Kerala throughout the 1960s while balancing out the disparities of industrialization. The CPI had Industries ministers who were responsible for industrial development. It also had an Industrial Development Cooperation that gave financial assistance to companies to help them startup new manufacturing projects. In the early 1970s, the CPI created two new corporations to help with industrial development: the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization and the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation. These measures improved industry on a state level, but were less successful at the local level. To revitalize local industry, the CPI launched an ambitious Four-Year Plan, perhaps modeling itself after Stalin's Five-Year Plans which Namboodiripad considered an inspiration. The Four-Year Plan involved district-level conventions to excite potential entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry. These entrepreneurs were trained to set up their own industries. The plan was hugely successful within the first 6 weeks and managed to set up eleven new industrial estates, but then lagged as the program continued.<ref name=gould/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Socialism in India]]\n*[[History of Kerala]]\n*[[Communism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books/about/Communism_in_Kerala.html?id=93W5rNYRC-0C Communism in Kerala: a study in political adaptation]\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060115045132/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2117/stories/20040827003109700.htm ''Frontline'']\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=4qeXGwAACAAJ&dq=Communism+in+Kerala&hl=en&ei=bNAuToXuFM_prQfupJC4Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ Communism in Kerala]\n*[http://cpimkerala.org/eng/in-defence-of-rights-of-minorities-37.php In Defence of Rights of Minorities]\n*[http://cpimkerala.org/eng/foreign-policy-and-security-issues-64.php Foreign Policy and Security Issues]\n{{Socialism by state}}\n\n[[Category:Communism in India]]\n[[Category:History of Kerala (1947\u2013present)]]\n[[Category:Politics of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Political history of Kerala]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2019}}\n{{sources|date=April 2020}}\n{{neutrality|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:India-KERALA.svg|thumb|Position of Kerala in India]]\n{{Communism in India}}\n'''Communism in Kerala''' refers to the strong presence of [[Communism|communist ideas]] in the [[India]]n [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Kerala]].

Brian built on the achievements of his father, [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorcain]], and especially his elder brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], Brian first made himself [[King of Munster]], then subjugated [[Leinster]], eventually becoming High King of [[Ireland]]. He was the founder of the [[O'Brien dynasty]], and is widely regarded as one of the most successful and unifying monarchs in medieval Ireland.\n\nWith a population of under 500,000 people, Ireland had over 150 kings, with greater or lesser domains.<ref>Donnchadh O Corrain, ''Ireland before the Normans'' (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1972)</ref> The U\u00ed N\u00e9ill king [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]], abandoned by his northern kinsmen of the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] and [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]], acknowledged Brian as High King at [[Athlone]] in 1002. In the decade that followed, Brian campaigned against the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, who refused to accept his claims, against Leinster, where resistance was frequent, and against the [[Norse Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] [[Kingdom of Dublin]].\n\nBrian's hard-won authority was seriously challenged in 1013 when his ally M\u00e1el Sechnaill was attacked by the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain king [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]], with the [[Ulster]]men as his allies. This was followed by further attacks on M\u00e1el Sechnaill by the Dubliners under their king [[Sihtric Silkbeard]] and the Leinstermen led by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Brian campaigned against these enemies in 1013. In 1014, Brian's armies confronted the armies of Leinster and Dublin. The resulting [[Battle of Clontarf]] saw Brian killed, his army nonetheless victorious against the Leinstermen and Norsemen. The battle is widely lauded as an instrumental moment in Irish history, and is well known in popular memory.\n\nBrian was well regarded by contemporary chroniclers. The Norse-Gaels and Scandinavians also produced works mentioning Brian, including ''[[Njal's Saga]]'', the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', and the now-lost ''[[Brj\u00e1ns saga|Brian's Saga]]''. Brian's war against M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sihtric was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to [[Gormlaith ingen Murchada|Gormlaith]], M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister and Sihtric's mother, who had been in turn the wife of [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], king of Dublin and [[Scandinavian York|York]], then of M\u00e1el Sechnaill, and finally of Brian.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family background===\n[[File:Brain Boru sculpture outside Chapel Royal outside Dublin Castle.JPG|thumb|left|Brian Boru sculpture outside [[Chapel Royal, Dublin]], [[Dublin Castle]] ]]\nHe was one of the 12 sons of [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in]] (d. 951), king of [[D\u00e1l gCais]] and king of Tuadmumu ([[Thomond]]), modern [[County Clare]], then a sub-kingdom in the north of [[Munster]]. Cenn\u00e9tig was described as ''r\u00edgdamna Caisil'', meaning that he was either heir or candidate (\"king material\") to the kingship of Cashel or Munster,<ref name=ODNB>Duffy, \"Brian B\u00f3ruma\"</ref> although this might be a later interpolation. Brian's mother was [[B\u00e9 Binn inion Urchadh]], daughter of [[Urchadh mac Murchadh]] (d. 945), king of [[Maigh Se\u00f3la]] in west Connacht.<ref name=Jaski45>Jaski, \"Brian Boru\", p. 45.</ref><ref name=ODNB /> That they belonged to the [[U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la]] may explain why he received the name Brian, which was rare among the D\u00e1l gCais.<ref name=ODNB />\n\nBrian's family were descended from the Ui Tairdelbach branch of the Dal gCais (or Deis Tuisceart). This branch had recently taken power from the more powerful Ui \u00d3engusso branch which had traditionally supplied the Kings of the Dal gCais. This power shift occurred after the death of Ui \u00d3engusso King Rebechan Mac Mothla who died as King of the Dal gCais in 934. The sons of Brian's grandfather Lorcan seized the opportunity and took power from the rival branch, with Brian's father [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in|Cenn\u00e9tig]] being the most successful of these. His father was the first King of the Dal gCais to lead an army beyond his own territory and lead an expedition as far north as [[Athlone]]. By his death in 951 had been acknowledged as \"King of Tuadmumu\".<ref>Brian Boru and The Battle of Clontarf, Se\u00e1n Duffy</ref> His brother [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]] built on these achievements and was the first to capture [[Rock of Cashel|Cashel]] and become [[King of Munster]].\n\nBrian was born at Kincora, [[Killaloe, County Clare|Killaloe]], a town in the region of Tuadmumu.<ref name=ODNB /> Brian's posthumous cognomen \"B\u00f3ruma\" (anglicised as Boru) may have referred to \"[[Brian Boru's Fort|B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma]]\", a fort north of Killaloe, where the D\u00e1l gCais held sway.<ref name=Jaski45 /><ref name=ODNB /><ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 15, notes that Brian is associated with B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma in a poem attributed to [[C\u00fa\u00e1n \u00faa Lothch\u00e1in]] (d. 1024).</ref> Another explanation, though possibly a late (re-)interpretation, is that the nickname represented Old Irish ''b\u00f3ruma'' \"of the cattle tribute\", referring to his capacity as a powerful overlord.<ref name=Jaski45 />\n\nThe [[River Shannon]] served as an easy route by which raids could be made against the provinces of [[Connacht]] and [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]]. Both Brian's father, Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in, and his older brother Mathgamain conducted river-borne raids, in which the young Brian would undoubtedly have participated. This was probably the root of his appreciation for [[navy|naval forces]] in his later career. Thus an important influence upon the Dalcassians was the presence of the [[Norse\u2013Gaels|Hiberno-Norse]] city of [[Limerick]] on an [[isthmus]] around which the Shannon River winds (known today as [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]] or the Island Field). The Norse had made many a raid themselves from the Shannon, and the Dalcassians likely benefited from some interaction with them, from which they would have been exposed to innovations such as superior weapons and ship design, all factors that may have contributed to their growing power.\n\nWhen their father died, the kingship of Tuadmumu passed to Brian's older brother, Mathgamain, and, when Mathgamain was killed in 976, Brian replaced him. Subsequently, he became the king of the entire kingdom of Munster.<ref name=McCullough106>McCullough(2002), p.106</ref>\n\n===Reign of his brother, Mathgamain===\nIn 964, Brian's older brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], claimed control over the entire province of Munster by capturing the [[Rock of Cashel]], capital of the ancient [[E\u00f3ganachta]], the hereditary overlords or High Kings of Munster, but who in dynastic strife and with multiple assassinations had weakened themselves to the point they were now impotent. Earlier attacks from both the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] and Vikings were also factors. This situation allowed the illegitimate (from the E\u00f3ganacht perspective) but militarized D\u00e1l Cais to attempt to seize the provincial kingship. Mathgamain was never fully recognized and was opposed throughout his career in the 960s and 970s by [[M\u00e1el Muad mac Brain]], a semi-outsider from the Cashel perspective but still a legitimate E\u00f3ganacht claimant from far south Munster.\n\nIn addition to M\u00e1el Muad, the Norse king [[Ivar of Limerick]] was a threat and may have been attempting to establish some overlordship in the province or a region of it himself, with the ''[[Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib]]'' even asserting he actually achieved this until routed by Mathgamain in the celebrated [[Battle of Sulcoit]] in 967. This victory was not decisive and eventually there grew up a brief alliance of sorts between Mathgamain, M\u00e1el Muad and others to drive the Norse \"soldiers\" or \"officials\" out of Munster and destroy their Limerick fortress in 972.<ref>[[Annals of Inisfallen]], 972</ref> The two Gaelic claimants were soon back to fighting and the fortuitous capture of Mathgamain in 976 by [[Donnub\u00e1n mac Cathail]] allowed him to be effortlessly dispatched or murdered by M\u00e1el Muad, who would now rule as king of Cashel for two years.\n\nThe D\u00e1l Cais remained a powerful force and Brian quickly proved to be as fine a commander of armies as his brother. After first dispatching the already much weakened Ivar in 977, he challenged M\u00e1el Muad in 978 and defeated him in the fateful [[Battle of Belach Lechta]], after which all the E\u00f3ganachta were no longer viable at the provincial level and Brian and the D\u00e1l Cais now enjoyed the overlordship, although not the traditional kingship of the province, which was based on lineage. Either soon before or soon after his victory over M\u00e1el Muad, Brian routed Donnub\u00e1n and the remainder of the Norse army in the [[Battle of Cathair Cuan]], there probably slaying the last of Ivar's sons and successor Aralt. He then allowed some of the Norse to remain in their settlement, but they were wealthy and now central to trade in the region, with a fleet of great value.\n\n[[Cian mac M\u00e1elmuaid|Cian]], the son of his brother Mathgamain's sworn enemy M\u00e1el Muad, later became a loyal ally of Brian and served under him in a number of campaigns.\n\n===Extending authority===\n[[File:Brian_Boru_Banner.jpg|thumb|left|Banner reputedly used by Brian <ref>Sir Lee MacMahon, ' Some Celtic Tribal Heraldry and Ancient Arms of Ireland, ' Irish-American Genealogist. The Augustan Society: Torrance, CA. Annual 1979. Pp. 256-259.</ref> of which the Clare GAA colors are based.]]\nHaving established unchallenged rule over his home Province of Munster, Brian turned to extending his authority over the neighboring provinces of [[Leinster]] to the east and Connacht to the north. By doing so, he came into conflict with High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] whose power base was the Province of [[Meath (province)|Meath]].\n\nFor the next fifteen years, from 982 to 997, High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill repeatedly led armies into Leinster and Munster, while Brian, like his father and brother before him, led his naval forces up the Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath on either side of the river. He suffered quite a few reverses in this struggle, but appears to have learned from his setbacks. He developed a military strategy that would serve him well throughout his career: the coordinated use of forces on both land and water, including on rivers and along Ireland's coast. Brian's naval forces, which included contingents supplied by the Hiberno-Norse cities that he brought under his control, provided both indirect and direct support for his forces on land. Indirect support involved a fleet making a diversionary attack on an enemy in a location far away from where Brian planned to strike with his army. Direct support involved naval forces acting as one arm in a [[Pincer movement|strategic pincer]], the army forming the other arm.\n\nIn 996 Brian finally managed to control the province of [[Leinster]], which may have been what led M\u00e1el Sechnaill to reach a compromise with him in the following year. By recognising Brian's authority over ''[[Leth Moga]]'', that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), M\u00e1el Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over ''[[Leth Cuinn]]'', that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, [[Connacht]], and [[Ulster]].\n\nPrecisely because he had submitted to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Given the circumstances under which M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda had been appointed, it is not surprising that he launched an open rebellion against Brian's authority.\n\nIn response, Brian assembled the forces of the Province of Munster with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's ally and cousin, [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]]. Together M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sigtrygg determined to meet Brian's army in battle rather than risk a [[siege]]. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the [[Battle of Glenmama]]. The [[Irish annals]] all agree that this was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Sulcoit]] thirty-two years before, by capturing and [[Looting|sacking]] the enemy's city.\n\nOnce again Brian opted for reconciliation; he requested Sigtrygg to return and resume his position as ruler of Dublin, giving Sigtrygg the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, just as he had with the Eoganacht King, Cian. It may have been on this occasion that Brian married Sigtrygg's mother and M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister [[Gormflaith]], the former wife of M\u00e1el Sechnaill.\n\n===The struggle for Ireland===\n[[File:The history of Ireland - from the earliest period to the present time; derived from native annals, and from the researches of Dr. O'Donovan, Eugene Curry, C. P. Meehan, R. R. Madden, and other eminent (14784629332).jpg|thumb|Engraving of Brian (1884)]]\nBrian made it clear that his ambitions had not been satisfied by the compromise of 997 when, in the year 1000, he led a combined Munster-Leinster-Dublin army in an attack on High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]]'s home province of Meath. The struggle over who would control all of Ireland was renewed. M\u00e1el Sechnaill's most important ally was the [[King of Connacht]], [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] (O'Connor), but this presented a number of problems. The provinces of Meath and Connacht were separated by the Shannon River, which served as both a route by which Brian's naval forces could attack the shores of either province and as a barrier to the two rulers providing mutual support for each other. M\u00e1el Sechnaill came up with an ingenious solution; two bridges would be erected across the Shannon. These bridges would serve as both obstacles preventing Brian's fleet from traveling up the Shannon and a means by which the armies of the provinces of Meath and Connacht could cross over into each other's kingdoms.\n\nThe Annals state that, in the year 1002, M\u00e1el Sechnaill surrendered his title to Brian, although they do not say anything about how or why this came about. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' provides a story in which Brian challenges High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill to a battle at the [[Hill of Tara]] in the province of Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. M\u00e1el Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.\n\nThere have been some doubts expressed about this explanation, given Brian's style of engaging in war; if he had found his opponent at a disadvantage it is most likely he would  have taken full advantage of it rather than allowing his enemy the time to even the odds. Also, given the length and intensity of the struggle between M\u00e1el Sechnaill and Brian, it seems unlikely that the High King would surrender his title without a fight. It is generally accepted that in 1002 Brian became the new High King of Ireland.\n\nUnlike some who had previously held the title, Brian intended to be High King in more than name. To accomplish this he needed to impose his will upon the regional rulers of the only province that did not already recognise his authority, [[Ulster]].\n\nUlster's geography presented a formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, and all three favoured the defenders. Brian first had to find a means of getting through or around these defensive [[choke point]]s, and then he had to subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.\n\n===High King===\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nIt was during this process that Brian pursued an alternative means of consolidating his control, not merely over the province of Ulster, but over Ireland as a whole. In contrast to its structure elsewhere, the [[Christianity in Ireland|Church in Ireland]] was centred, not around the bishops of [[diocese]]s and archbishops of [[archdiocese]]s, but rather around [[monastery|monasteries]] headed by powerful abbots who were members of the royal dynasties of the lands in which their monasteries resided. Among the most important monasteries was [[Armagh]], located in the Province of Ulster.\n\nBrian's advisor, [[Maelsuthain O'Carroll]], documented in the '[[Book of Armagh]]' that, in the year 1005, Brian donated 22 ounces of gold to this monastery and declared that Armagh was the religious capital of Ireland, to which all other monasteries should send the funds they collected. This was a clever move, for the supremacy of the monastery of Armagh would last only so long as Brian remained the High King. Therefore, it was in the interest of Armagh to support Brian with all their wealth and power.\n\nBrian is not referred to in the passage from the 'Book of Armagh' as the 'Ard R\u00ed' &mdash;that is, High-King&mdash; but rather he is declared \"''Imperator Scottorum'',\" or \"Emperor of the Gaels\".\n\nThough it is only speculation, it has been suggested that Brian and the Church in Ireland were together seeking to establish a new form of kingship in Ireland, one that was modelled after the kingships of England and France, in which there were no lesser ranks of regional kings &ndash; simply one king who had (or sought to have) power over all in a [[unitary state]]. In any case, whether as High King or Emperor, by 1011 all of the regional rulers in Ireland acknowledged Brian's authority. No sooner had this been achieved than it was lost again.\n\n[[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]] of [[Leinster]] had only accepted Brian's authority grudgingly, and in 1012 he rose in rebellion. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' relates a story in which one of Brian's sons insults M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda, which leads him to declare his independence from Brian's authority. Whatever the actual reason was, M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought allies with which to defy the High-King. He found one in a regional ruler in Ulster who had only recently submitted to Brian. Together they attacked the province of Meath, where the former High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill sought Brian's help to defend his kingdom.\n\nIn 1013 Brian led a force from his own province of Munster and from southern Connacht into Leinster; a detachment under his son Murchad ravaged the southern half of the province of Leinster for three months. The forces under Murchad and Brian were reunited on 9 September outside the walls of Dublin. The city was blockaded, but it was the High King's army that ran out of supplies first, so that Brian was forced to abandon the siege and return to Munster around [[Christmas]].\n\n===Battle of Clontarf===\n{{Main|Battle of Clontarf}}\n[[File:'Battle of Clontarf', oil on canvas painting by Hugh Frazer, 1826.jpg|300px|thumb|Oil painting of Battle of Clontarf by [[Hugh Frazer (artist)|Hugh Frazer]] 1826]]\nM\u00e1el M\u00f3rda was aware that the High King would return to Dublin in 1014 to try once more to defeat him. He may have hoped that by defying Brian, he could enlist the aid of all the other regional rulers. If so, he was sorely disappointed.  The province of Ulster and most of the province of Connacht failed to support either side of the conflict, with the exception of a single ruler in Ulster who sent troops to M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. His inability to obtain troops from any rulers in Ireland, may explain why M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought support from rulers outside Ireland. He instructed his subordinate and cousin, Sigtrygg, the ruler of Dublin, to travel overseas to enlist aid.\n\nSigtrygg sailed to [[Orkney]], and on his return stopped at the [[Isle of Man]]. These islands had been occupied by the Vikings long before and the Hiberno-Norse had close ties with Orkney and the Isle of Man. There was even a precedent for employing Norsemen from the isles; they had been used by Sigtrygg's father, [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], in 980, and by Sigtrygg himself in 990. Their incentive was loot, not land.\n\nContrary to the assertions made in the ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'', this was not an attempt by the Vikings to reconquer Ireland. All of the Norsemen, both the [[Norse-Gaels]] of Dublin and the Norsemen from the Isles, were in the service of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. The High King had 'Vikings' in his army as well:  the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick and probably those of Waterford, Wexford, and Cork as well. Some sources include a rival gang of Norse mercenaries from the Isle of Man.  Essentially this conflict was an Irish civil war with minor foreign participation.<ref name=McCullough109>McCullough(2002), p.109</ref>\n\nAlong with whatever troops he obtained from abroad, Brian mustered troops from his home province of Munster, southern Connacht, and the province of Meath, commanded by his old rival M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill. Brian's army may have outnumbered M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's, since Brian felt secure enough to dispatch a mounted detachment under the command of his youngest son, Donnchad, to raid southern Leinster, presumably hoping to force M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda to release his contingents from there to return to defend their homes.\n\nA disagreement with the King of Meath resulted in M\u00e1el Sechnaill withdrawing his support. Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad and ask him to return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late. To compound Brian's problems, the Norse contingents, led by [[Sigurd Hlodvirsson]], [[Earl of Orkney]] and [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir]] of the Isle of Man, arrived on [[Palm Sunday]], 18 April. The battle occurred five days later, on [[Good Friday]], 23 April 1014 just north of the city of [[Dublin]], at [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]].<ref name=McCullough111>McCullough(2002), p.111</ref>\n\n[[File:07 Brian on the Morning of Clontarf.jpg|thumb|Brian on the Morning of Clontarf]]\n[[File:St Patrick's (COI) Cathedral, Armagh 087.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Brian Boru's burial place in St. Patrick's Cathedral, (COI), Armagh]]\n\nAll of the accounts state that the [[Battle of Clontarf]] lasted all day.

This work is thought to have been commissioned by Brian's great-grandson [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]] as a means of justifying the Ua Briain claim to the High-Kingship, a title upon which the U\u00ed Neill had had a near-monopoly.

Until the 1970s most scholarly writing concerning the Vikings' activities in Ireland, as well as the career of Brian Boru, accepted the claims of ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'' at face value.\n\nWhile Brian did not free Ireland from a Norse ([[Vikings|Viking]]) occupation, simply because it was never entirely conquered by the Vikings, his rule saw consistent conflict against Vikings and Viking-founded settlements, the latter all having been founded to give raiders easier access to the interior of Ireland. In the last decade of the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, beginning in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. Within only a few generations, some Norse had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and had often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians refer to as the Hiberno-Norse.<ref name=\"Campbell2013\">{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Kenneth L.|title=Ireland's History: Prehistory to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaBOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT46|date=5 December 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-6784-0|pages=46\u201351}}</ref>\n\nSuch Hiberno-Norse cities occupied a tenuous position within Ireland's political scene long before the birth of Brian.

She is said to have been the mother of his sons Murchad, Conchobar and Flann. Later genealogies claimed that these sons left no descendants, although in fact Murchad's son Tadc is recorded as being killed at Clontarf along with his father and grandfather.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 31; Duffy.</ref>\n\nAnother wife, Echrad, was a daughter of Carlus mac Ailella, King of U\u00ed \u00c1eda Odba, an obscure branch of the southern [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. She was the mother of Brian's son [[Tadc mac Briain|Tadc]], whose son [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain|Toirdelbach]] and grandson [[Muirchertach Ua Briain|Muirchertach]] rivalled Brian in power and fame.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 32; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian's most famous marriage was with [[Gormflaith ingen Murchada|Gormflaith]], sister of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda of Leinster. [[Donnchad mac Briain|Donnchad]], who had his half-brother Tadc killed in 1023 and ruled Munster for 40 years thereafter, was the result of this union.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, pp. 31&ndash;32; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian had a sixth son, Domnall. Although he predeceased his father, Domnall apparently had at least one surviving child, a son whose name is not recorded. Domnall may perhaps have been the son of Brian's fourth known wife, Dub Choblaig, who died in 1009. She was a daughter of King [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] of Connacht.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, pp. 31 & 32&ndash;33; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian had at least three daughters, but their mothers are not recorded.

Brian built on the achievements of his father, [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorcain]], and especially his elder brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], Brian first made himself [[King of Munster]], then subjugated [[Leinster]], eventually becoming High King of [[Ireland]]. He was the founder of the [[O'Brien dynasty]], and is widely regarded as one of the most successful and unifying monarchs in medieval Ireland.\n\nWith a population of under 500,000 people, Ireland had over 150 kings, with greater or lesser domains.<ref>Donnchadh O Corrain, ''Ireland before the Normans'' (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1972)</ref> The U\u00ed N\u00e9ill king [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]], abandoned by his northern kinsmen of the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] and [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]], acknowledged Brian as High King at [[Athlone]] in 1002. In the decade that followed, Brian campaigned against the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, who refused to accept his claims, against Leinster, where resistance was frequent, and against the [[Norse Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] [[Kingdom of Dublin]].\n\nBrian's hard-won authority was seriously challenged in 1013 when his ally M\u00e1el Sechnaill was attacked by the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain king [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]], with the [[Ulster]]men as his allies. This was followed by further attacks on M\u00e1el Sechnaill by the Dubliners under their king [[Sihtric Silkbeard]] and the Leinstermen led by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Brian campaigned against these enemies in 1013. In 1014, Brian's armies confronted the armies of Leinster and Dublin. The resulting [[Battle of Clontarf]] saw Brian killed, his army nonetheless victorious against the Leinstermen and Norsemen. The battle is widely lauded as an instrumental moment in Irish history, and is well known in popular memory.\n\nBrian was well regarded by contemporary chroniclers. The Norse-Gaels and Scandinavians also produced works mentioning Brian, including ''[[Njal's Saga]]'', the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', and the now-lost ''[[Brj\u00e1ns saga|Brian's Saga]]''. Brian's war against M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sihtric was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to [[Gormlaith ingen Murchada|Gormlaith]], M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister and Sihtric's mother, who had been in turn the wife of [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], king of Dublin and [[Scandinavian York|York]], then of M\u00e1el Sechnaill, and finally of Brian.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family background===\n[[File:Brain Boru sculpture outside Chapel Royal outside Dublin Castle.JPG|thumb|left|Brian Boru sculpture outside [[Chapel Royal, Dublin]], [[Dublin Castle]] ]]\nHe was one of the 12 sons of [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in]] (d. 951), king of [[D\u00e1l gCais]] and king of Tuadmumu ([[Thomond]]), modern [[County Clare]], then a sub-kingdom in the north of [[Munster]]. Cenn\u00e9tig was described as ''r\u00edgdamna Caisil'', meaning that he was either heir or candidate (\"king material\") to the kingship of Cashel or Munster,<ref name=ODNB>Duffy, \"Brian B\u00f3ruma\"</ref> although this might be a later interpolation. Brian's mother was [[B\u00e9 Binn inion Urchadh]], daughter of [[Urchadh mac Murchadh]] (d. 945), king of [[Maigh Se\u00f3la]] in west Connacht.<ref name=Jaski45>Jaski, \"Brian Boru\", p. 45.</ref><ref name=ODNB /> That they belonged to the [[U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la]] may explain why he received the name Brian, which was rare among the D\u00e1l gCais.<ref name=ODNB />\n\nBrian's family were descended from the Ui Tairdelbach branch of the Dal gCais (or Deis Tuisceart). This branch had recently taken power from the more powerful Ui \u00d3engusso branch which had traditionally supplied the Kings of the Dal gCais. This power shift occurred after the death of Ui \u00d3engusso King Rebechan Mac Mothla who died as King of the Dal gCais in 934. The sons of Brian's grandfather Lorcan seized the opportunity and took power from the rival branch, with Brian's father [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in|Cenn\u00e9tig]] being the most successful of these. His father was the first King of the Dal gCais to lead an army beyond his own territory and lead an expedition as far north as [[Athlone]]. By his death in 951 had been acknowledged as \"King of Tuadmumu\".<ref>Brian Boru and The Battle of Clontarf, Se\u00e1n Duffy</ref> His brother [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]] built on these achievements and was the first to capture [[Rock of Cashel|Cashel]] and become [[King of Munster]].\n\nBrian was born at Kincora, [[Killaloe, County Clare|Killaloe]], a town in the region of Tuadmumu.<ref name=ODNB /> Brian's posthumous cognomen \"B\u00f3ruma\" (anglicised as Boru) may have referred to \"[[Brian Boru's Fort|B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma]]\", a fort north of Killaloe, where the D\u00e1l gCais held sway.<ref name=Jaski45 /><ref name=ODNB /><ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 15, notes that Brian is associated with B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma in a poem attributed to [[C\u00fa\u00e1n \u00faa Lothch\u00e1in]] (d. 1024).</ref> Another explanation, though possibly a late (re-)interpretation, is that the nickname represented Old Irish ''b\u00f3ruma'' \"of the cattle tribute\", referring to his capacity as a powerful overlord.<ref name=Jaski45 />\n\nThe [[River Shannon]] served as an easy route by which raids could be made against the provinces of [[Connacht]] and [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]]. Both Brian's father, Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in, and his older brother Mathgamain conducted river-borne raids, in which the young Brian would undoubtedly have participated. This was probably the root of his appreciation for [[navy|naval forces]] in his later career. Thus an important influence upon the Dalcassians was the presence of the [[Norse\u2013Gaels|Hiberno-Norse]] city of [[Limerick]] on an [[isthmus]] around which the Shannon River winds (known today as [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]] or the Island Field). The Norse had made many a raid themselves from the Shannon, and the Dalcassians likely benefited from some interaction with them, from which they would have been exposed to innovations such as superior weapons and ship design, all factors that may have contributed to their growing power.\n\nWhen their father died, the kingship of Tuadmumu passed to Brian's older brother, Mathgamain, and, when Mathgamain was killed in 976, Brian replaced him. Subsequently, he became the king of the entire kingdom of Munster.<ref name=McCullough106>McCullough(2002), p.106</ref>\n\n===Reign of his brother, Mathgamain===\nIn 964, Brian's older brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], claimed control over the entire province of Munster by capturing the [[Rock of Cashel]], capital of the ancient [[E\u00f3ganachta]], the hereditary overlords or High Kings of Munster, but who in dynastic strife and with multiple assassinations had weakened themselves to the point they were now impotent. Earlier attacks from both the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] and Vikings were also factors. This situation allowed the illegitimate (from the E\u00f3ganacht perspective) but militarized D\u00e1l Cais to attempt to seize the provincial kingship. Mathgamain was never fully recognized and was opposed throughout his career in the 960s and 970s by [[M\u00e1el Muad mac Brain]], a semi-outsider from the Cashel perspective but still a legitimate E\u00f3ganacht claimant from far south Munster.\n\nIn addition to M\u00e1el Muad, the Norse king [[Ivar of Limerick]] was a threat and may have been attempting to establish some overlordship in the province or a region of it himself, with the ''[[Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib]]'' even asserting he actually achieved this until routed by Mathgamain in the celebrated [[Battle of Sulcoit]] in 967. This victory was not decisive and eventually there grew up a brief alliance of sorts between Mathgamain, M\u00e1el Muad and others to drive the Norse \"soldiers\" or \"officials\" out of Munster and destroy their Limerick fortress in 972.<ref>[[Annals of Inisfallen]], 972</ref> The two Gaelic claimants were soon back to fighting and the fortuitous capture of Mathgamain in 976 by [[Donnub\u00e1n mac Cathail]] allowed him to be effortlessly dispatched or murdered by M\u00e1el Muad, who would now rule as king of Cashel for two years.\n\nThe D\u00e1l Cais remained a powerful force and Brian quickly proved to be as fine a commander of armies as his brother. After first dispatching the already much weakened Ivar in 977, he challenged M\u00e1el Muad in 978 and defeated him in the fateful [[Battle of Belach Lechta]], after which all the E\u00f3ganachta were no longer viable at the provincial level and Brian and the D\u00e1l Cais now enjoyed the overlordship, although not the traditional kingship of the province, which was based on lineage. Either soon before or soon after his victory over M\u00e1el Muad, Brian routed Donnub\u00e1n and the remainder of the Norse army in the [[Battle of Cathair Cuan]], there probably slaying the last of Ivar's sons and successor Aralt. He then allowed some of the Norse to remain in their settlement, but they were wealthy and now central to trade in the region, with a fleet of great value.\n\n[[Cian mac M\u00e1elmuaid|Cian]], the son of his brother Mathgamain's sworn enemy M\u00e1el Muad, later became a loyal ally of Brian and served under him in a number of campaigns.\n\n===Extending authority===\n[[File:Brian_Boru_Banner.jpg|thumb|left|Banner reputedly used by Brian <ref>Sir Lee MacMahon, ' Some Celtic Tribal Heraldry and Ancient Arms of Ireland, ' Irish-American Genealogist. The Augustan Society: Torrance, CA. Annual 1979. Pp. 256-259.</ref> of which the Clare GAA colors are based.]]\nHaving established unchallenged rule over his home Province of Munster, Brian turned to extending his authority over the neighboring provinces of [[Leinster]] to the east and Connacht to the north. By doing so, he came into conflict with High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] whose power base was the Province of [[Meath (province)|Meath]].\n\nFor the next fifteen years, from 982 to 997, High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill repeatedly led armies into Leinster and Munster, while Brian, like his father and brother before him, led his naval forces up the Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath on either side of the river. He suffered quite a few reverses in this struggle, but appears to have learned from his setbacks. He developed a military strategy that would serve him well throughout his career: the coordinated use of forces on both land and water, including on rivers and along Ireland's coast. Brian's naval forces, which included contingents supplied by the Hiberno-Norse cities that he brought under his control, provided both indirect and direct support for his forces on land. Indirect support involved a fleet making a diversionary attack on an enemy in a location far away from where Brian planned to strike with his army. Direct support involved naval forces acting as one arm in a [[Pincer movement|strategic pincer]], the army forming the other arm.\n\nIn 996 Brian finally managed to control the province of [[Leinster]], which may have been what led M\u00e1el Sechnaill to reach a compromise with him in the following year. By recognising Brian's authority over ''[[Leth Moga]]'', that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), M\u00e1el Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over ''[[Leth Cuinn]]'', that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, [[Connacht]], and [[Ulster]].\n\nPrecisely because he had submitted to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Given the circumstances under which M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda had been appointed, it is not surprising that he launched an open rebellion against Brian's authority.\n\nIn response, Brian assembled the forces of the Province of Munster with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's ally and cousin, [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]]. Together M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sigtrygg determined to meet Brian's army in battle rather than risk a [[siege]]. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the [[Battle of Glenmama]]. The [[Irish annals]] all agree that this was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Sulcoit]] thirty-two years before, by capturing and [[Looting|sacking]] the enemy's city.\n\nOnce again Brian opted for reconciliation; he requested Sigtrygg to return and resume his position as ruler of Dublin, giving Sigtrygg the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, just as he had with the Eoganacht King, Cian. It may have been on this occasion that Brian married Sigtrygg's mother and M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister [[Gormflaith]], the former wife of M\u00e1el Sechnaill.\n\n===The struggle for Ireland===\n[[File:The history of Ireland - from the earliest period to the present time; derived from native annals, and from the researches of Dr. O'Donovan, Eugene Curry, C. P. Meehan, R. R. Madden, and other eminent (14784629332).jpg|thumb|Engraving of Brian (1884)]]\nBrian made it clear that his ambitions had not been satisfied by the compromise of 997 when, in the year 1000, he led a combined Munster-Leinster-Dublin army in an attack on High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]]'s home province of Meath. The struggle over who would control all of Ireland was renewed. M\u00e1el Sechnaill's most important ally was the [[King of Connacht]], [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] (O'Connor), but this presented a number of problems. The provinces of Meath and Connacht were separated by the Shannon River, which served as both a route by which Brian's naval forces could attack the shores of either province and as a barrier to the two rulers providing mutual support for each other. M\u00e1el Sechnaill came up with an ingenious solution; two bridges would be erected across the Shannon. These bridges would serve as both obstacles preventing Brian's fleet from traveling up the Shannon and a means by which the armies of the provinces of Meath and Connacht could cross over into each other's kingdoms.\n\nThe Annals state that, in the year 1002, M\u00e1el Sechnaill surrendered his title to Brian, although they do not say anything about how or why this came about. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' provides a story in which Brian challenges High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill to a battle at the [[Hill of Tara]] in the province of Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. M\u00e1el Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.\n\nThere have been some doubts expressed about this explanation, given Brian's style of engaging in war; if he had found his opponent at a disadvantage it is most likely he would  have taken full advantage of it rather than allowing his enemy the time to even the odds. Also, given the length and intensity of the struggle between M\u00e1el Sechnaill and Brian, it seems unlikely that the High King would surrender his title without a fight. It is generally accepted that in 1002 Brian became the new High King of Ireland.\n\nUnlike some who had previously held the title, Brian intended to be High King in more than name. To accomplish this he needed to impose his will upon the regional rulers of the only province that did not already recognise his authority, [[Ulster]].\n\nUlster's geography presented a formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, and all three favoured the defenders. Brian first had to find a means of getting through or around these defensive [[choke point]]s, and then he had to subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.\n\n===High King===\n{{unsourced|date=April 2020}}\nIt was during this process that Brian pursued an alternative means of consolidating his control, not merely over the province of Ulster, but over Ireland as a whole. In contrast to its structure elsewhere, the [[Christianity in Ireland|Church in Ireland]] was centred, not around the bishops of [[diocese]]s and archbishops of [[archdiocese]]s, but rather around [[monastery|monasteries]] headed by powerful abbots who were members of the royal dynasties of the lands in which their monasteries resided. Among the most important monasteries was [[Armagh]], located in the Province of Ulster.\n\nBrian's advisor, [[Maelsuthain O'Carroll]], documented in the '[[Book of Armagh]]' that, in the year 1005, Brian donated 22 ounces of gold to this monastery and declared that Armagh was the religious capital of Ireland, to which all other monasteries should send the funds they collected. This was a clever move, for the supremacy of the monastery of Armagh would last only so long as Brian remained the High King. Therefore, it was in the interest of Armagh to support Brian with all their wealth and power.\n\nBrian is not referred to in the passage from the 'Book of Armagh' as the 'Ard R\u00ed' &mdash;that is, High-King&mdash; but rather he is declared \"''Imperator Scottorum'',\" or \"Emperor of the Gaels\".\n\nThough it is only speculation, it has been suggested that Brian and the Church in Ireland were together seeking to establish a new form of kingship in Ireland, one that was modelled after the kingships of England and France, in which there were no lesser ranks of regional kings &ndash; simply one king who had (or sought to have) power over all in a [[unitary state]]. In any case, whether as High King or Emperor, by 1011 all of the regional rulers in Ireland acknowledged Brian's authority. No sooner had this been achieved than it was lost again.\n\n[[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]] of [[Leinster]] had only accepted Brian's authority grudgingly, and in 1012 he rose in rebellion. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' relates a story in which one of Brian's sons insults M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda, which leads him to declare his independence from Brian's authority. Whatever the actual reason was, M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought allies with which to defy the High-King. He found one in a regional ruler in Ulster who had only recently submitted to Brian. Together they attacked the province of Meath, where the former High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill sought Brian's help to defend his kingdom.\n\nIn 1013 Brian led a force from his own province of Munster and from southern Connacht into Leinster; a detachment under his son Murchad ravaged the southern half of the province of Leinster for three months. The forces under Murchad and Brian were reunited on 9 September outside the walls of Dublin. The city was blockaded, but it was the High King's army that ran out of supplies first, so that Brian was forced to abandon the siege and return to Munster around [[Christmas]].\n\n===Battle of Clontarf===\n{{Main|Battle of Clontarf}}\n[[File:'Battle of Clontarf', oil on canvas painting by Hugh Frazer, 1826.jpg|300px|thumb|Oil painting of Battle of Clontarf by [[Hugh Frazer (artist)|Hugh Frazer]] 1826]]\nM\u00e1el M\u00f3rda was aware that the High King would return to Dublin in 1014 to try once more to defeat him. He may have hoped that by defying Brian, he could enlist the aid of all the other regional rulers. If so, he was sorely disappointed.  The province of Ulster and most of the province of Connacht failed to support either side of the conflict, with the exception of a single ruler in Ulster who sent troops to M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. His inability to obtain troops from any rulers in Ireland, may explain why M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought support from rulers outside Ireland. He instructed his subordinate and cousin, Sigtrygg, the ruler of Dublin, to travel overseas to enlist aid.\n\nSigtrygg sailed to [[Orkney]], and on his return stopped at the [[Isle of Man]]. These islands had been occupied by the Vikings long before and the Hiberno-Norse had close ties with Orkney and the Isle of Man. There was even a precedent for employing Norsemen from the isles; they had been used by Sigtrygg's father, [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], in 980, and by Sigtrygg himself in 990. Their incentive was loot, not land.\n\nContrary to the assertions made in the ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'', this was not an attempt by the Vikings to reconquer Ireland. All of the Norsemen, both the [[Norse-Gaels]] of Dublin and the Norsemen from the Isles, were in the service of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. The High King had 'Vikings' in his army as well:  the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick and probably those of Waterford, Wexford, and Cork as well. Some sources include a rival gang of Norse mercenaries from the Isle of Man.  Essentially this conflict was an Irish civil war with minor foreign participation.<ref name=McCullough109>McCullough(2002), p.109</ref>\n\nAlong with whatever troops he obtained from abroad, Brian mustered troops from his home province of Munster, southern Connacht, and the province of Meath, commanded by his old rival M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill. Brian's army may have outnumbered M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's, since Brian felt secure enough to dispatch a mounted detachment under the command of his youngest son, Donnchad, to raid southern Leinster, presumably hoping to force M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda to release his contingents from there to return to defend their homes.\n\nA disagreement with the King of Meath resulted in M\u00e1el Sechnaill withdrawing his support. Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad and ask him to return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late. To compound Brian's problems, the Norse contingents, led by [[Sigurd Hlodvirsson]], [[Earl of Orkney]] and [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir]] of the Isle of Man, arrived on [[Palm Sunday]], 18 April. The battle occurred five days later, on [[Good Friday]], 23 April 1014 just north of the city of [[Dublin]], at [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]].<ref name=McCullough111>McCullough(2002), p.111</ref>\n\n[[File:07 Brian on the Morning of Clontarf.jpg|thumb|Brian on the Morning of Clontarf]]\n[[File:St Patrick's (COI) Cathedral, Armagh 087.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Brian Boru's burial place in St. Patrick's Cathedral, (COI), Armagh]]\n\nAll of the accounts state that the [[Battle of Clontarf]] lasted all day.

This work is thought to have been commissioned by Brian's great-grandson [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]] as a means of justifying the Ua Briain claim to the High-Kingship, a title upon which the U\u00ed Neill had had a near-monopoly. Recent research has suggested that it might have been commissioned by Muirchertach's contemporary and cousin, Brian Glinne Maidhir, or at least someone favourable to the line descended from Brian's son, Donnchad.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Casey|first=Denis|year=2013|title=A reconsideration of the authorship and transmission of Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh.|jstor=42751271|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Section C|volume=113C|pages=139\u201361|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of this book on both scholarly and popular authors cannot be exaggerated. Until the 1970s most scholarly writing concerning the Vikings' activities in Ireland, as well as the career of Brian Boru, accepted the claims of ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'' at face value.\n\nWhile Brian did not free Ireland from a Norse ([[Vikings|Viking]]) occupation, simply because it was never entirely conquered by the Vikings, his rule saw consistent conflict against Vikings and Viking-founded settlements, the latter all having been founded to give raiders easier access to the interior of Ireland. In the last decade of the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, beginning in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. Within only a few generations, some Norse had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and had often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians refer to as the Hiberno-Norse.<ref name=\"Campbell2013\">{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Kenneth L.|title=Ireland's History: Prehistory to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaBOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT46|date=5 December 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-6784-0|pages=46\u201351}}</ref>\n\nSuch Hiberno-Norse cities occupied a tenuous position within Ireland's political scene long before the birth of Brian. They often suffered attacks from Irish rulers, and made alliances with others. The Norse, who initially attacked and subsequently settled in Ireland, were partially assimilated by the Irish.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Newman |first=Roger Chatterton |title=Brian Boru: King of Ireland |location=Dublin |publisher=Anvil Books |year=1983|page=92|isbn=978-1-85635-719-7 }}</ref> However, Brian's father was likely slain by the Norse of Limerick and he himself died during a revolt that was supported by multiple Viking leaders, specifically the Norse of Mann.\n\n==Wives and children==\nBrian's first wife was M\u00f3r, daughter of the King of [[U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidne]] of Connacht. She is said to have been the mother of his sons Murchad, Conchobar and Flann. Later genealogies claimed that these sons left no descendants, although in fact Murchad's son Tadc is recorded as being killed at Clontarf along with his father and grandfather.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 31; Duffy.</ref>\n\nAnother wife, Echrad, was a daughter of Carlus mac Ailella, King of U\u00ed \u00c1eda Odba, an obscure branch of the southern [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. She was the mother of Brian's son [[Tadc mac Briain|Tadc]], whose son [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain|Toirdelbach]] and grandson [[Muirchertach Ua Briain|Muirchertach]] rivalled Brian in power and fame.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 32; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian's most famous marriage was with [[Gormflaith ingen Murchada|Gormflaith]], sister of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda of Leinster. [[Donnchad mac Briain|Donnchad]], who had his half-brother Tadc killed in 1023 and ruled Munster for 40 years thereafter, was the result of this union.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, pp. 31&ndash;32; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian had a sixth son, Domnall. Although he predeceased his father, Domnall apparently had at least one surviving child, a son whose name is not recorded. Domnall may perhaps have been the son of Brian's fourth known wife, Dub Choblaig, who died in 1009. She was a daughter of King [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] of Connacht.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, pp. 31 & 32&ndash;33; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian had at least three daughters, but their mothers are not recorded. Sadb, whose death in 1048 is recorded by the ''Annals of Innisfallen'', was married to [[Cian mac M\u00e1el Muaid|Cian]], son of [[M\u00e1el Muad mac Brain]]. B\u00e9 Binn was married to the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill king [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]].
