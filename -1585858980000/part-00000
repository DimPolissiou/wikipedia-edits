In 2003, following his involvement in a campaign to defeat a ballot initiative that would have permitted a large hillside development project, he ran for the city council in Ventura.<ref>Murillo, Sandra, \"Urban Planner Enters Ventura Race,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 4, 2003 [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/04/local/me-fulton4]</ref> In the election, he received more votes than any other candidate.<ref>Wilson, Tracey, and Fred Alvarez, \"2 New Faces on Ventura City Council,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 5, 2003.[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/437843451.html?dids=437843451:437843451&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+5%2C+2003&author=Tracy+Wilson+and+Fred+Alvarez&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=2+New+Faces+on+Ventura+Council%3B+In+addition+to+the+newcomers%2C+Carl+Morehouse+is+reelected.+Voter+turnout+is+light%2C+owing+in+part+to+the+low-profile+campaign.]</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Fulton sought re-election as a thoughtful moderate.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Candidate Prefers Careful Consensus Approach to Issues, ''Ventura County Star,'' October 18, 2007 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/oct/18/candidate-prefers-careful-consensus-approach-to/]</ref> After a successful re-election campaign,<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Low Turnout May Have Helped Incumbents,\" ''Ventura County Star,'' November 8, 2007 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/nov/08/ventura-re-elects-incumbents/]</ref> Fulton was selected deputy mayor by his colleagues.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Ventura Councilwoman Newest Mayor,\" ''Ventura County Star,''December 4, 2007.[http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/dec/04/ventura-councilwoman-newest-mayor/]\n</ref> In early 2009, Fulton was said to be considering running in 2010 to represent [[California's 35th State Assembly district]], a seat being vacated by the term-limited [[Pedro Nava (politician)|Pedro Nava]].<ref>Herdt, Timm, \"Oil Drilling Deal Splits Democrats,\" ''Ventura County Star,'' March 11, 2009 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/mar/11/oil-drilling-deal-splits-democrats-fracture-the/]</ref> However, he chose not to run for the Assembly seat, which was eventually won by [[Das Williams]].<ref>Fulton, Bill, \"I'm Committed to Serving Ventura,\" Bill Fulton Blog, June 8, 2009 [http://fulton4ventura.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-committed-to-serving-ventura.html]</ref> Fulton instead was selected as mayor by his city council colleagues in December 2009.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Fulton New Ventura Mayor, Tracy Is Deputy,\" ''Ventura County Star,'' December 8, 2009 [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/dec/07/fulton-new-ventura-mayor-tracy-is-deputy/]</ref> He served as mayor until his term on the city council ended in December 2011 and did not seek re-election.\n\nDuring his career as a city councilmember and mayor, Fulton emphasized both urban planning and economic development issues. In 2004, Ventura hired as its city manager [[Rick Cole]], a former mayor of [[Pasadena, California]] who is well known for his leadership on urban planning issues. Two years later Cole was selected by [[Governing Magazine]] as one of its \"Public Officials of the Year\".<ref>http://www.governing.com/poy/2006-Public-Officials-of-the-Year.html</ref> In 2005, Ventura adopted one of the first all-[[infill]] General Plans in the United States.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Ventura approves an updated general plan,\" Ventura County ''Star'', August 9, 2005.</ref> Subsequently, Cole served as a Deputy Mayor for Los Angeles Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] and in 2015 was named City Manager of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = City of Santa Monica - Santa Monica City Council Names Rick Cole as New City Manager|url = https://www.smgov.net/Main/News_Tab/Santa_Monica_City_Council_Names_Rick_Cole_as_New_City_Manager.aspx|website = www.smgov.net|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref>\n\nAs mayor, Fulton played a major role in promoting Ventura's [[creative economy]], especially the growing arts and culture scene<ref>Kallas, Anne, \"Ceremony Celebrates Ventura Art Community,\" Ventura County Star, November 18, 2011</ref> and the city's innovative high-tech incubator and venture capital efforts, bringing national attention to the city's work in both these areas.<ref>Collins, Michael, \"Ventura Mayor Tells Other Cities To Nurture Businesses,\" Ventura County Star, March 16, 2010.</ref>\n\nA longtime devotee and former student of UCLA \"parking guru\" [[Donald Shoup]],<ref>Groves, Martha, \"He Puts Parking in His Place,\" Los Angeles Times, October 16, 2010</ref> Fulton championed the introduction of Ventura's widely hailed downtown parking management system, which included some paid on-street parking, while he was mayor in 2010.

[[Jerry Brown]]'s proposal to eliminate [[redevelopment agencies]], the longstanding urban revitalization tool. At a speech in Sacramento, Fulton, a longtime advocate of redevelopment reform, said he believed redevelopment should be replaced with a more targeted and effective tool for revitalization. California cities, he said, \"should not confuse the job we have to do with the tool we've been accustomed to using.\"<ref>Herdt, Timm, \"Ventura Mayor: Cities Should Prepare for the End of Redevelopment,\" Ventura County Star, March 24, 2011. http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/mar/24/ventura-mayor-cities-should-prepare-for-end-of/</ref>\n\n==Smart Growth America==\nShortly before leaving office, Fulton announced that he would relocate to Washington, D.C., to become Vice President of [[Smart Growth America]], a nationwide advocacy group.<ref>Biasotti, Tony, \"Ventura Mayor Plans To Move To D.C.

He focused especially on making the argument that smart growth is a better fiscal deal for taxpayers than sprawl, which often requires costly taxpayer subsidies.<ref>Marsteller, Duane, \"Growth Planner Urges Less Sprawl For Nashville,\" ''The Tennessean'', April 21, 2013</ref>\n\n==San Diego==\nIn June 2013, then-San Diego Mayor [[Bob Filner]]<nowiki/> made the surprising announcement that Fulton had agreed to return to California to serve as the city's planning director. San Diego's Planning Department had been dismantled under Filner's predecessor, [[Jerry Sanders (politician)|Jerry Sanders]].

However, new Mayor [[Kevin Faulconer]], who was elected in February 2014 to fill out the remainder of Filner's term, created a separate Economic Development Department and shut down the Civic Innovation Lab. Faulconer had also opposed the Fulton-endorsed [[Barrio Logan]] Community Plan Update, which passed the City Council but was subsequently overturned by voters in an industry-led citywide referendum.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/aug/02/tp-fulton-leaving-city-planner-post/|title=Fulton leaving city planner post|last=Showley|first=Roger|date=August 2, 2014|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref> In August 1, 2014, it was announced Fulton would leave the city effective August 30 to become head of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref>[http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/west_university/news/nationally-recognized-urban-planner-william-fulton-named-director-of-rice/article_3da1ca64-413a-5ac8-95d3-6e8a6a2e7f0f.html \"Nationally recognized urban planner William Fulton named director of Rice University's Kinder Institute for Urban Research\"] (August 1, 2014) ''[[Your Houston News]]''</ref>\n\nFulton said he left for a better opportunity and praised Faulconer's support of Community Plans Updates.<ref>http://voiceofsandiego.org/2014/08/01/why-bill-fultons-resignation-isnt-shocking/</ref> But many local commentators suggested he had been squeezed out by Faulconer.

Mr. Fulton's management style is to delegate all of his work to other employees, and then promote them to make them feel as though they are equals. <ref>http://www.houstonmatters.org/segments/segment-a/2014/12/11/is-gentrification-of-houston-neighborhoods-a-good-or-bad-thing</ref>\n\nIn early 2016, [[Houston Endowment Inc.|Houston Endowment Inc]]. announced a three-year, $7 million grant to the Kinder Institute to build a computerized \"Urban Data Platform\" and launch three new programs Fulton had created\u2014Urban & Metropolitan Governance; Urban Development, Transportation & Placemaking; and Urban Disparity & Opportunity.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kinder grant seeks solutions to 'complex issues'|url = http://www.chron.com/local/education/campus-chronicles/article/Kinder-Institute-grant-aimed-at-helping-find-6798143.php|website = Houston Chronicle|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref>\n\nUnder his leadership, the Kinder Institute has emerged as the leading urban think tank in Houston, tackling such issues as Houston's pension crisis<ref>https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/08/11/163917/kinder-institute-report-suggests-reforms-for-houston-to-deal-with-city-pensions-problem/</ref>, street safety in underserved neighborhoods of Houston<ref>https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/transportation/2019/03/25/326314/study-transit-dependent-houstonians-are-struggling-with-poor-sidewalks/</ref>, gentrification and affordable housing<ref>https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/shows/houston-matters/2018/12/18/315862/study-neighborhoods-on-houstons-east-side-and-inside-loop-susceptible-to-gentrification/</ref>. The Kinder Institute also has played a major role in researching ways to make Houston more resilient after [[Hurricane Harvey]] -- for example, by working with other research institutions to document the fact that two-thirds of Houston's apartments are located in [[flood plains]]<ref>https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Study-More-than-475-000-Harris-County-residents-13704459.php</ref>.\n\nWhile at the Kinder Institute, Fulton published a book,''Talk City,'' a collection of blogs from his time as Mayor and Councilmember in Ventura.\n\n==Personal life and family==\nFulton lives in Houston with his wife, Natalie Ramos Fulton, a school counselor and special education teacher. In early 2010, Fulton publicly announced that he had been diagnosed with [[retinitis pigmentosa]], a degenerative retinal condition that gradually robs those who have it of their [[peripheral vision]] and [[night vision]] and often leads to complete blindness.<ref>http://fulton4ventura.blogspot.com/2010/02/keeping-vision-alive.html</ref> Fulton's nephew, Eric Fulton, who is also affected by RP, is active in the Washington, D.C. area in raising funds for the [[Foundation Fighting Blindness]] to find treatments and a cure.<ref>Carter, Aaron, \"Eric Fulton Fights Blindness For His Family,\" Rockville ''Patch,'' August 29, 2011.</ref> His daughter, Brooke Ezra Torf-Fulton, received her Doctoral degree in Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine from  [[The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine]], a part of the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] She previously lived in Tel Aviv with her husband, Tzachi, where has worked with the [[Hiddush]] to advocate for more liberal marriage laws in Israel.<ref>Regev, Uri, \"Why Is It So Difficult For Jews To Marry in Israel,\" Huffington Post, May 1, 2013</ref> They now live in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] with their son, Alon.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of mayors of Ventura, California]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Selected works==\n[[Peter Calthorpe|Calthorpe, Peter]], and William Fulton.

In 2003, following his involvement in a campaign to defeat a ballot initiative that would have permitted a large hillside development project, he ran for the city council in Ventura.<ref>Murillo, Sandra, \"Urban Planner Enters Ventura Race,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 4, 2003 [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/04/local/me-fulton4]</ref> In the election, he received more votes than any other candidate.<ref>Wilson, Tracey, and Fred Alvarez, \"2 New Faces on Ventura City Council,\" ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 5, 2003.[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/437843451.html?dids=437843451:437843451&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+5%2C+2003&author=Tracy+Wilson+and+Fred+Alvarez&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=2+New+Faces+on+Ventura+Council%3B+In+addition+to+the+newcomers%2C+Carl+Morehouse+is+reelected.+Voter+turnout+is+light%2C+owing+in+part+to+the+low-profile+campaign.]</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Fulton sought re-election as a thoughtful moderate.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Candidate Prefers Careful Consensus Approach to Issues, ''Ventura County Star,'' October 18, 2007 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/oct/18/candidate-prefers-careful-consensus-approach-to/]</ref> After a successful re-election campaign,<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Low Turnout May Have Helped Incumbents,\" ''Ventura County Star,'' November 8, 2007 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/nov/08/ventura-re-elects-incumbents/]</ref> Fulton was selected deputy mayor by his colleagues.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Ventura Councilwoman Newest Mayor,\" ''Ventura County Star,''December 4, 2007.[http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/dec/04/ventura-councilwoman-newest-mayor/]\n</ref> In early 2009, Fulton was said to be considering running in 2010 to represent [[California's 35th State Assembly district]], a seat being vacated by the term-limited [[Pedro Nava (politician)|Pedro Nava]].<ref>Herdt, Timm, \"Oil Drilling Deal Splits Democrats,\" ''Ventura County Star,'' March 11, 2009 [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/mar/11/oil-drilling-deal-splits-democrats-fracture-the/]</ref> However, he chose not to run for the Assembly seat, which was eventually won by [[Das Williams]].<ref>Fulton, Bill, \"I'm Committed to Serving Ventura,\" Bill Fulton Blog, June 8, 2009 [http://fulton4ventura.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-committed-to-serving-ventura.html]</ref> Fulton instead was selected as mayor by his city council colleagues in December 2009.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Fulton New Ventura Mayor, Tracy Is Deputy,\" ''Ventura County Star,'' December 8, 2009 [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2009/dec/07/fulton-new-ventura-mayor-tracy-is-deputy/]</ref> He served as mayor until his term on the city council ended in December 2011 and did not seek re-election.\n\nDuring his career as a city councilmember and mayor, Fulton emphasized both urban planning and economic development issues. In 2004, Ventura hired as its city manager [[Rick Cole]], a former mayor of [[Pasadena, California]] who is well known for his leadership on urban planning issues. Two years later Cole was selected by [[Governing Magazine]] as one of its \"Public Officials of the Year\".<ref>http://www.governing.com/poy/2006-Public-Officials-of-the-Year.html</ref> In 2005, Ventura adopted one of the first all-[[infill]] General Plans in the United States.<ref>Clerici, Kevin, \"Ventura approves an updated general plan,\" Ventura County ''Star'', August 9, 2005.</ref> Subsequently, Cole served as a Deputy Mayor for Los Angeles Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] and in 2015 was named City Manager of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = City of Santa Monica - Santa Monica City Council Names Rick Cole as New City Manager|url = https://www.smgov.net/Main/News_Tab/Santa_Monica_City_Council_Names_Rick_Cole_as_New_City_Manager.aspx|website = www.smgov.net|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref>\n\nAs mayor, Fulton played a major role in promoting Ventura's [[creative economy]], especially the growing arts and culture scene<ref>Kallas, Anne, \"Ceremony Celebrates Ventura Art Community,\" Ventura County Star, November 18, 2011</ref> and the city's innovative high-tech incubator and venture capital efforts, bringing national attention to the city's work in both these areas.<ref>Collins, Michael, \"Ventura Mayor Tells Other Cities To Nurture Businesses,\" Ventura County Star, March 16, 2010.</ref>\n\nA longtime devotee and former student of UCLA \"parking guru\" [[Donald Shoup]],<ref>Groves, Martha, \"He Puts Parking in His Place,\" Los Angeles Times, October 16, 2010</ref> Fulton championed the introduction of Ventura's widely hailed downtown parking management system, which included some paid on-street parking, while he was mayor in 2010.

[[Jerry Brown]]'s proposal to eliminate [[redevelopment agencies]], the longstanding urban revitalization tool. At a speech in Sacramento, Fulton, a longtime advocate of redevelopment reform, said he believed redevelopment should be replaced with a more targeted and effective tool for revitalization. California cities, he said, \"should not confuse the job we have to do with the tool we've been accustomed to using.\"<ref>Herdt, Timm, \"Ventura Mayor: Cities Should Prepare for the End of Redevelopment,\" Ventura County Star, March 24, 2011. http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/mar/24/ventura-mayor-cities-should-prepare-for-end-of/</ref>\n\n==Smart Growth America==\nShortly before leaving office, Fulton announced that he would relocate to Washington, D.C., to become Vice President of [[Smart Growth America]], a nationwide advocacy group.<ref>Biasotti, Tony, \"Ventura Mayor Plans To Move To D.C.

However, new Mayor [[Kevin Faulconer]], who was elected in February 2014 to fill out the remainder of Filner's term, created a separate Economic Development Department and shut down the Civic Innovation Lab. Faulconer had also opposed the Fulton-endorsed [[Barrio Logan]] Community Plan Update, which passed the City Council but was subsequently overturned by voters in an industry-led citywide referendum.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/aug/02/tp-fulton-leaving-city-planner-post/|title=Fulton leaving city planner post|last=Showley|first=Roger|date=August 2, 2014|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref> In August 1, 2014, it was announced Fulton would leave the city effective August 30 to become head of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref>[http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/west_university/news/nationally-recognized-urban-planner-william-fulton-named-director-of-rice/article_3da1ca64-413a-5ac8-95d3-6e8a6a2e7f0f.html \"Nationally recognized urban planner William Fulton named director of Rice University's Kinder Institute for Urban Research\"] (August 1, 2014) ''[[Your Houston News]]''</ref>\n\nFulton said he left for a better opportunity and praised Faulconer's support of Community Plans Updates.<ref>http://voiceofsandiego.org/2014/08/01/why-bill-fultons-resignation-isnt-shocking/</ref> But many local commentators suggested he had been squeezed out by Faulconer.

In its core, the Sun fuses 500 million [[metric ton]]s of hydrogen each second.]]\n[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|400 px|The [[nuclear binding energy]] curve. The formation of nuclei with masses up to [[Iron-56]] releases energy, as illustrated above. ]]\n{{nuclear physics}}\n'''Nuclear fusion''' is a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[atomic nuclei]] are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles ([[neutrons]] or [[protons]]). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \"[[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]]\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \"[[main sequence]]\" [[star]]s, or other [[Absolute magnitude|high magnitude]] stars.\n\nA fusion process that produces nuclei lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally release energy. These elements have relatively small mass per nucleon and large [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]]. Fusion nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, [[nuclear fission]]. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium fusion|helium]], are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[Uranium 235|uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[Plutonium 239|plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.\n\nIn 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested hydrogen-helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy. [[Quantum tunneling]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Hund]] in 1929, and shortly afterwards [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]] used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei. Building on the early experiments in [[nuclear transmutation]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], laboratory fusion of [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] was accomplished by [[Mark Oliphant]] in 1932. In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars was worked out by [[Hans Bethe]].  Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the [[Greenhouse Item]] nuclear test.  Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on 1 November 1952, in the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test.\n\nResearch into developing controlled fusion inside [[fusion reactors]] has been ongoing since the 1940s, but the technology is still in its development phase.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|Fusion of [[deuterium]] with [[tritium]] creating [[helium-4]], freeing a [[neutron]], and releasing 17.59 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] as kinetic energy of the products while a corresponding amount of mass disappears, in agreement with ''kinetic E'' = \u0394''mc''<sup>2</sup>, where ''\u0394''m is the decrease in the total rest mass of particles.<ref name=Shultis>\n{{cite book\n |author1=Shultis, J.K.  |author2=Faw, R.E. \n  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002\n |title=Fundamentals of nuclear science and engineering\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO4Lmw8XoEMC&pg=PA151\n |page=151\n |publisher=[[CRC Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-8247-0834-4\n}}</ref>]]\nThe release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the [[nuclear force]], which combines together protons and neutrons, and the [[Coulomb force]], which causes protons to repel each other. Protons are positively charged and repel each other by the Coulomb force, but they can nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another, short-range, force referred to as nuclear attraction.<ref>[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 Physics Flexbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228011150/http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 |date=28 December 2011 }}. Ck12.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref> Light nuclei (or nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor allowing the nuclear force to overcome repulsion. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. [[iron peak|For larger nuclei]], however, no energy is released, since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across  longer nuclear length scales. Thus, energy is not released with the fusion of such nuclei; instead, energy is required as input for such processes.\n\nFusion powers [[star]]s and produces virtually all elements in a process called [[nucleosynthesis]]. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second.<!-- Meant generally; please do not insert info about [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] and other types of specific nucleosynthesis here. --> The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an [[alpha particle]] or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.<ref name=\"bulletin1950\">{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg4AAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA99 |title=The Hydrogen Bomb |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=April 1950 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=99\u2013104, 125\u2013|doi=10.1080/00963402.1950.11461231 |bibcode=1950BuAtS...6d..99B }}</ref>\n\nIt takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, [[hydrogen]]. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and be brought close enough such that the attractive [[nuclear force]] is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The [[strong force]] grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially \"fall\" into each other and the result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a [[free neutron]] or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that can produce self-sustaining reactions.\n\nEnergy{{anchor|energy}} released in most [[nuclear reaction]]s is much larger than in [[chemical reaction]]s, because the [[binding energy]] that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds [[electron]]s to a nucleus. For example, the [[ionization energy]] gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is {{val|13.6|ul=eV}}\u2014less than one-millionth of the {{val|17.6|ul=MeV}} released in the [[deuterium]]\u2013[[tritium]] (D\u2013T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. Fusion reactions have an [[energy density]] many times greater than [[nuclear fission]]; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though ''individual'' fission reactions are generally much more energetic than ''individual'' fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] of [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass into energy]], such as that caused by the [[annihilation|annihilatory]] collision of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion. (The complete conversion of one [[gram]] of matter would release 9\u00d710<sup>13</sup> joules of energy.)\n\nResearch into using [[fusion power|fusion]] for the production of electricity has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made.

In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of the fusion process.  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).\n\nAround 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington>{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4  |pages=297\u2013303 |date=October 1920 |doi=10.1126/science.52.1341.233 |jstor=6491|pmid=17747682 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1429642 }}</ref><ref name=eddington2>{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16\u201335|last1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}</ref> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to [[Mass\u2013energy_equivalence|Einstein's equation]] ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:\n\n:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)\n:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nThe primary source of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton-proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].\n\n==Requirements==\n\nA substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion in stars|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.\n\nWhen a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.\n\nThe electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall.  Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunnelling to act.]]\n\nThe net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei]. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-17.</ref> Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide2|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}} through the alpha process.\n\nAn exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons (it is a [[doubly magic]] nucleus), so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.  Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].\n\nThe situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong [[nuclear force]] can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the [[Coulomb barrier]].\n\nThe Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.\n\nUsing [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium\u2013tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&nbsp;eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable <sup>5</sup>He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining <sup>4</sup>He nucleus is 3.5&nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.\n\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\nThe reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] (\u03c3) is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted <\u03c3v>. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is <\u03c3v> times the product of the reactant number densities:\n\n:<math>f = n_1 n_2 \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle.</math>\n\nIf a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product <math>n_1n_2</math> must be replaced by <math>n^2/2</math>.\n\n<math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]\u2013[[1 E-14 J|100]]&nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.\n\nThe significance of <math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].  This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.<ref name=lawson>[http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Artificial fusion ==\n{{main article|Fusion power}}\n\n=== Thermonuclear fusion ===\n{{main article|Thermonuclear fusion}}\nIf matter is sufficiently heated (hence being [[plasma physics|plasma]]) and confined, fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles.

Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner\u2014requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves. \n\nTo overcome the problem of bremsstrahlung radiation in Beam-target fusion, a combinatorial approach has been suggested by Tri-Alpha and Helion energy companies, this method is based on interpenetration of two oppositely directed plasmoids.<ref>J. Slough, G. Votroubek, and C. Pihl, \"Creation of a high-temperature plasma through merging and compression of supersonic field reversed configuration plasmoids\" Nucl.

In order to attain the necessary conditions of break-even by this method the accelerated plasmoids must have enough colliding velocities of the order of some thousands of kilometers per second (10<sup>6</sup> m/s) depending on the kind of fusion fuel.<ref> A.

In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.\n\nSome reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-<sup>6</sup>Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions. There is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Lithium|7}} reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when ''T''<sub>i</sub> > 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but {{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.\n\nIn addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to \"breed\" tritium in \"dry\" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:\n<!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]\n{{Nuclide2|neutron}} + {{Nuclide2|lithium|6}} -> T + He + 4.784 MeV\nn + {{Nuclide2|lithium|7}} -> T + He + n \u2013 2.467 MeV\n\n-->:{| border=\"0\"\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 4.784 MeV\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|7}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] \u2013 2.467 MeV\n|}\n\nThe latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the [[Castle Bravo]] fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo \"Shrimp\" had understood the usefulness of <sup>6</sup>Li in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that <sup>7</sup>Li fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While <sup>7</sup>Li has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.<ref name=cross_section>[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4c.html Subsection 4.7.4c]. Kayelaby.npl.co.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref>  The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.\n\nTo evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the [[nuclear cross section]]. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product ''nT''\u03c4 required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is \"ignited\" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                              !!

For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are \"right\". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.\n\n===Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density===\n\nAny of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''<sub>fus</sub>, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''<sub>ch</sub>, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.\n\nSpecification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):\n\n:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} \u2192 {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]],  ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9&nbsp;MeV, ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35&nbsp;MeV.\n\nFor calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D-D reaction'' as ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 17.6&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (3.27&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 12.5&nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 3.5&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (0.82&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 4.2&nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,<ref>A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E<sub>T</sub> (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>\u2212(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25 to [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>+(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25. For E<sub>T</sub>=1.01&nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&nbsp;MeV to 6.73&nbsp;MeV.</ref> so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225 million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).\n\nAnother unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.\n\nWith this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                           !!''Z''!!''E''<sub>fus</sub> [MeV]!!''E''<sub>ch</sub> [MeV]!!neutronicity\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}                  ||  1  || 17.6 || 3.5 || 0.80\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}                ||  1  || 12.5 || 4.2 || 0.66\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}                   ||  2  || 18.3 ||18.3 || \u22480.05\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}              ||  5  || 8.7  || 8.7 || \u22480.001\n|}\n\nThe last column is the '''[[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]]''' of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (''E''<sub>fus</sub>-''E''<sub>ch</sub>)/''E''<sub>fus</sub>. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.\n\nOf course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(''Z''+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.\n\nThus there is a \"penalty\" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a \"hot ion mode\", the \"penalty\" would not apply.) There is at the same time a \"bonus\" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.\n\nWe can now compare these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                     !!<\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>!!penalty/bonus !!inverse reactivity!!Lawson criterion!!power density (W/m<sup>3</sup>/kPa<sup>2</sup>)!!inverse ratio of power density\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}    || 1.24\u00d710<sup>\u221224</sup> ||  1  ||    1 ||   1 || 34     ||    1\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}  || 1.28\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> ||  2  ||   48 ||  30 ||  0.5   ||   68\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}     || 2.24\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> || 2/3 ||   83 ||  16 ||  0.43  ||   80\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}        || 1.46\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/2 || 1700 ||     || 0.005 || 6800\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}        || 3.01\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/3 || 1240 || 500 || 0.014 || 2500\n|}\n\nThe maximum value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is taken from a previous table. The \"penalty/bonus\" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column \"inverse reactivity\" are found by dividing 1.24{{e|-24}} by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column \"[[Lawson criterion]]\" weights these results with ''E''<sub>ch</sub> and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled \"power density\" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''<sub>fus</sub>. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.\n\n===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===\nThe ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10\u201330 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].\n\nThe huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.\n \nThe ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                    !!''T''<sub>i</sub> (keV)!!''P''<sub>fusion</sub>/''P''<sub>Bremsstrahlung</sub>\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}   ||   50 || 140\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} ||  500 ||   2.9\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}    ||  100 ||   5.3\n|-\n|{{nuclide|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}       || 1000 ||   0.72\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}      ||  800 ||   0.21\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}       ||  300 ||   0.57\n|}\n\nThe actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.\n\nThe temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem.

Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:\n\n<math>E_{\\text{thresh}}= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \\xrightarrow{\\text{2 protons}} \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{1 \\text{ fm}} \\approx 1.4 \\text{ MeV}</math>\n\nThis would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is <math>10^{-290}</math>, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Parameterization of cross section ===\nThe probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|DeBroglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunnelling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particle will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction.  An estimation of the fusion cross sectional area is often broken into three pieces:\n\n:<math>\\sigma \\approx \\sigma_{geometry} \\times T \\times R</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction. \n\n<math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is of the order of the square of the de-Broglie wavelength <math>\\sigma_{geometry} \\approx \\lambda^2 = \\bigg( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_r v} \\bigg)^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} </math> where <math>m_r </math> is the reduced mass of the system and <math>\\epsilon  </math> is the center of mass energy of the system. \n\n{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: <math>T \\approx e^ {- \\sqrt{\\epsilon_G /\\epsilon} } </math> where <math>\\epsilon_G = ( \\pi \\alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \\times 2 m_r c^2 </math> is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier. \n\n{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of <math>R(\\epsilon)</math> is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the [[S-factor|Astrophysical S-factor]], <math>S(\\epsilon)</math>, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{S(\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon} e^{ -  \\epsilon_G / \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}</math>\n\nMore detailed forms of the cross section can be derived through nuclear physics based models and [[R-matrix]] theory.\n\n=== Formulas of fusion cross sections ===\nThe Naval Research Lab's plasma physics formulary<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/online_pubs/NRL_FORMULARY_13.pdf|title=NRL PLASMA FORMULARY|last=Huba|first=J.|date=2003|website=MIT Catalog|access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> gives the total cross section in [[Barn_(unit)|barns]] as a function of the energy (in keV) of the incident particle towards a target ion at rest fit by the formula:\n\n<math>\\sigma^{NRL}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{A_5 + \\big( (A_4 - A_3 \\epsilon)^2 + 1) \\big)^{-1} A_2}{ \\epsilon (e^{A_1 \\epsilon^{-1/2} }-1)}</math> with the following coefficient values:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+NRL Formulary Cross Section Coefficients\n!\n!DT(1)\n!DD(2i)\n!DD(2ii)\n!DHe<sup>3</sup>(3)\n!TT(4)\n!THe<sup>3</sup>(6)\n|-\n|A1\n|45.95\n|46.097\n|47.88\n|89.27\n|38.39\n|123.1\n|-\n|A2\n|50200\n|372\n|482\n|25900\n|448\n|11250\n|-\n|A3\n|1.368e-2\n|4.36e-4\n|3.08e-4\n|3.98e-3\n|1.02e-3\n|0\n|-\n|A4\n|1.076\n|1.22\n|1.177\n|1.297\n|2.09\n|0\n|-\n|A5\n|409\n|0\n|0\n|647\n|0\n|0\n|}\nBosch-Hale<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Improved formulas for fusion cross-sections and thermal reactivities|journal=Nuclear Fusion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=611\u2013631|last=Bosch|first=H.

The formation of nuclei with masses up to [[Iron-56]] releases energy, as illustrated above. ]]\n{{nuclear physics}}\n'''Nuclear fusion''' is a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[atomic nuclei]] are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles ([[neutrons]] or [[protons]]). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \"[[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]]\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \"[[main sequence]]\" [[star]]s, or other [[Absolute magnitude|high magnitude]] stars.\n\nA fusion process that produces nuclei lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally release energy. These elements have relatively small mass per nucleon and large [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]]. Fusion nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, [[nuclear fission]]. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium fusion|helium]], are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[Uranium 235|uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[Plutonium 239|plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.\n\nIn 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested hydrogen-helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy. [[Quantum tunneling]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Hund]] in 1929, and shortly afterwards [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]] used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei. Building on the early experiments in [[nuclear transmutation]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], laboratory fusion of [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] was accomplished by [[Mark Oliphant]] in 1932. In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars was worked out by [[Hans Bethe]].  Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the [[Greenhouse Item]] nuclear test.  Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on 1 November 1952, in the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test.\n\nResearch into developing controlled fusion inside [[fusion reactors]] has been ongoing since the 1940s, but the technology is still in its development phase.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|Fusion of [[deuterium]] with [[tritium]] creating [[helium-4]], freeing a [[neutron]], and releasing 17.59 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] as kinetic energy of the products while a corresponding amount of mass disappears, in agreement with ''kinetic E'' = \u0394''mc''<sup>2</sup>, where ''\u0394''m is the decrease in the total rest mass of particles.<ref name=Shultis>\n{{cite book\n |author1=Shultis, J.K.  |author2=Faw, R.E. \n  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002\n |title=Fundamentals of nuclear science and engineering\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO4Lmw8XoEMC&pg=PA151\n |page=151\n |publisher=[[CRC Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-8247-0834-4\n}}</ref>]]\nThe release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the [[nuclear force]], which combines together protons and neutrons, and the [[Coulomb force]], which causes protons to repel each other. Protons are positively charged and repel each other by the Coulomb force, but they can nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another, short-range, force referred to as nuclear attraction.<ref>[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 Physics Flexbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228011150/http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 |date=28 December 2011 }}. Ck12.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref> Light nuclei (or nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor allowing the nuclear force to overcome repulsion. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. [[iron peak|For larger nuclei]], however, no energy is released, since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across  longer nuclear length scales. Thus, energy is not released with the fusion of such nuclei; instead, energy is required as input for such processes.\n\nFusion powers [[star]]s and produces virtually all elements in a process called [[nucleosynthesis]]. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second.<!-- Meant generally; please do not insert info about [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] and other types of specific nucleosynthesis here. --> The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an [[alpha particle]] or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.<ref name=\"bulletin1950\">{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg4AAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA99 |title=The Hydrogen Bomb |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=April 1950 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=99\u2013104, 125\u2013|doi=10.1080/00963402.1950.11461231 |bibcode=1950BuAtS...6d..99B }}</ref>\n\nIt takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, [[hydrogen]]. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and brought close enough such that the attractive [[nuclear force]] is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The [[strong force]] grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially \"fall\" into each other and the result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a [[free neutron]] or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that can produce self-sustaining reactions.\n\nEnergy{{anchor|energy}} released in most [[nuclear reaction]]s is much larger than in [[chemical reaction]]s, because the [[binding energy]] that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds [[electron]]s to a nucleus. For example, the [[ionization energy]] gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is {{val|13.6|ul=eV}}\u2014less than one-millionth of the {{val|17.6|ul=MeV}} released in the [[deuterium]]\u2013[[tritium]] (D\u2013T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. Fusion reactions have an [[energy density]] many times greater than [[nuclear fission]]; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though ''individual'' fission reactions are generally much more energetic than ''individual'' fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] of [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass into energy]], such as that caused by the [[annihilation|annihilatory]] collision of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion. (The complete conversion of one [[gram]] of matter would release 9\u00d710<sup>13</sup> joules of energy.)\n\nResearch into using [[fusion power|fusion]] for the production of electricity has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Progress in Fusion\n |url=http://www.iter.org/sci/beyonditer\n |publisher=[[ITER]]\n |accessdate=2010-02-15\n}}</ref> The two most advanced approaches for it are magnetic confinement (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs).\n\nWorkable designs for a toroidal reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see [[ITER]]).

In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of the fusion process.  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).\n\nAround 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington>{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4  |pages=297\u2013303 |date=October 1920 |doi=10.1126/science.52.1341.233 |jstor=6491|pmid=17747682 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1429642 }}</ref><ref name=eddington2>{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16\u201335|last1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}</ref> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to [[Mass\u2013energy_equivalence|Einstein's equation]] ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:\n\n:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)\n:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nThe primary source of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton-proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].\n\n==Requirements==\n\nA substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion in stars|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.\n\nWhen a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.\n\nThe electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall.  Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunnelling to act.]]\n\nThe net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei]. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-17.</ref> Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide2|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}} through the alpha process.\n\nAn exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons (it is a [[doubly magic]] nucleus), so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.  Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].\n\nThe situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong [[nuclear force]] can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the [[Coulomb barrier]].\n\nThe Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.\n\nUsing [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium\u2013tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&nbsp;eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable <sup>5</sup>He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining <sup>4</sup>He nucleus is 3.5&nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.\n\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\nThe reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] (\u03c3) is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted <\u03c3v>. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is <\u03c3v> times the product of the reactant number densities:\n\n:<math>f = n_1 n_2 \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle.</math>\n\nIf a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product <math>n_1n_2</math> must be replaced by <math>n^2/2</math>.\n\n<math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]\u2013[[1 E-14 J|100]]&nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.\n\nThe significance of <math>\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle</math> as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].  This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.<ref name=lawson>[http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Artificial fusion ==\n{{main article|Fusion power}}\n\n=== Thermonuclear fusion ===\n{{main article|Thermonuclear fusion}}\nIf matter is sufficiently heated (hence being [[plasma physics|plasma]]) and confined, fusion reactions may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies of the particles.

Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner\u2014requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves. \n\nTo overcome the problem of bremsstrahlung radiation in Beam-target fusion, a combinatorial approach has been suggested by Tri-Alpha and Helion energy companies, this method is based on interpenetration of two oppositely directed plasmoids.<ref>J.

In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.\n\nSome reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-<sup>6</sup>Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions. There is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Lithium|7}} reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when ''T''<sub>i</sub> > 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but {{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.\n\nIn addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to \"breed\" tritium in \"dry\" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:\n<!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]\n{{Nuclide2|neutron}} + {{Nuclide2|lithium|6}} -> T + He + 4.784 MeV\nn + {{Nuclide2|lithium|7}} -> T + He + n \u2013 2.467 MeV\n\n-->:{| border=\"0\"\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 4.784 MeV\n|- style=\"height:2em;\"\n|[[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]]&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|7}}&nbsp;||\u2192&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] \u2013 2.467 MeV\n|}\n\nThe latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the [[Castle Bravo]] fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo \"Shrimp\" had understood the usefulness of <sup>6</sup>Li in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that <sup>7</sup>Li fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While <sup>7</sup>Li has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.<ref name=cross_section>[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4c.html Subsection 4.7.4c].

Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref>  The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.\n\nTo evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the [[nuclear cross section]]. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product ''nT''\u03c4 required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is \"ignited\" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                              !!

For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are \"right\". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.\n\n===Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density===\n\nAny of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''<sub>fus</sub>, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''<sub>ch</sub>, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.\n\nSpecification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):\n\n:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} \u2192 {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n<sup>0</sup>]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]],  ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9&nbsp;MeV, ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35&nbsp;MeV.\n\nFor calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D-D reaction'' as ''E''<sub>fus</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 17.6&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (3.27&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 12.5&nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''<sub>ch</sub> = (4.03&nbsp;MeV + 3.5&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% + (0.82&nbsp;MeV)\u00d750% = 4.2&nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,<ref>A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E<sub>T</sub> (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>\u2212(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25 to [(12E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>+(5\u00d717.6MeV+2\u00d7E<sub>T</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>]<sup>2</sup>/25. For E<sub>T</sub>=1.01&nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&nbsp;MeV to 6.73&nbsp;MeV.</ref> so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225 million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).\n\nAnother unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.\n\nWith this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                           !!''Z''!!''E''<sub>fus</sub> [MeV]!!''E''<sub>ch</sub> [MeV]!!neutronicity\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}                  ||  1  || 17.6 || 3.5 || 0.80\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}                ||  1  || 12.5 || 4.2 || 0.66\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}                   ||  2  || 18.3 ||18.3 || \u22480.05\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}              ||  5  || 8.7  || 8.7 || \u22480.001\n|}\n\nThe last column is the '''[[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]]''' of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (''E''<sub>fus</sub>-''E''<sub>ch</sub>)/''E''<sub>fus</sub>. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.\n\nOf course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(''Z''+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.\n\nThus there is a \"penalty\" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a \"hot ion mode\", the \"penalty\" would not apply.) There is at the same time a \"bonus\" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.\n\nWe can now compare these reactions in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                     !!<\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup>!!penalty/bonus !!inverse reactivity!!Lawson criterion!!power density (W/m<sup>3</sup>/kPa<sup>2</sup>)!!inverse ratio of power density\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}    || 1.24\u00d710<sup>\u221224</sup> ||  1  ||    1 ||   1 || 34     ||    1\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}}  || 1.28\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> ||  2  ||   48 ||  30 ||  0.5   ||   68\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}     || 2.24\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup> || 2/3 ||   83 ||  16 ||  0.43  ||   80\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}        || 1.46\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/2 || 1700 ||     || 0.005 || 6800\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}        || 3.01\u00d710<sup>\u221227</sup> || 1/3 || 1240 || 500 || 0.014 || 2500\n|}\n\nThe maximum value of <\u03c3v>/T<sup>2</sup> is taken from a previous table. The \"penalty/bonus\" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column \"inverse reactivity\" are found by dividing 1.24{{e|-24}} by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column \"[[Lawson criterion]]\" weights these results with ''E''<sub>ch</sub> and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled \"power density\" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''<sub>fus</sub>. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.\n\n===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===\nThe ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10\u201330 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].\n\nThe huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.\n \nThe ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!fuel                                                    !!''T''<sub>i</sub> (keV)!!''P''<sub>fusion</sub>/''P''<sub>Bremsstrahlung</sub>\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|tritium}}   ||   50 || 140\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} ||  500 ||   2.9\n|-\n|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}    ||  100 ||   5.3\n|-\n|{{nuclide|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}       || 1000 ||   0.72\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|lithium|6}}      ||  800 ||   0.21\n|-\n|p<sup>+</sup>-{{nuclide|boron|11}}       ||  300 ||   0.57\n|}\n\nThe actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.\n\nThe temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}} and [[Proton|p<sup>+</sup>]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|boron|11}} the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma are considered\u2014and rejected\u2014in ''fundamental limitations on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fundamental Limitations on Plasma Fusion Systems not in Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume= 56-07 |issue=Section B|page= 3820|author=Rider, Todd Harrison|bibcode=1995PhDT........45R|year=1995}}</ref><ref>Rostoker, Norman; Binderbauer, Michl and Qerushi,\nArtan.

Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:\n\n<math>E_{\\text{thresh}}= \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \\xrightarrow{\\text{2 protons}} \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{1 \\text{ fm}} \\approx 1.4 \\text{ MeV}</math>\n\nThis would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is <math>10^{-290}</math>, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Parameterization of cross section ===\nThe probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|DeBroglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunnelling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particle will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction.  An estimation of the fusion cross sectional area is often broken into three pieces:\n\n:<math>\\sigma \\approx \\sigma_{geometry} \\times T \\times R</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction. \n\n<math>\\sigma_{geometry} </math> is of the order of the square of the de-Broglie wavelength <math>\\sigma_{geometry} \\approx \\lambda^2 = \\bigg( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_r v} \\bigg)^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} </math> where <math>m_r </math> is the reduced mass of the system and <math>\\epsilon  </math> is the center of mass energy of the system. \n\n{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: <math>T \\approx e^ {- \\sqrt{\\epsilon_G /\\epsilon} } </math> where <math>\\epsilon_G = ( \\pi \\alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \\times 2 m_r c^2 </math> is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier. \n\n{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of <math>R(\\epsilon)</math> is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the [[S-factor|Astrophysical S-factor]], <math>S(\\epsilon)</math>, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{S(\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon} e^{ -  \\epsilon_G / \\sqrt{\\epsilon}}</math>\n\nMore detailed forms of the cross section can be derived through nuclear physics based models and [[R-matrix]] theory.\n\n=== Formulas of fusion cross sections ===\nThe Naval Research Lab's plasma physics formulary<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/online_pubs/NRL_FORMULARY_13.pdf|title=NRL PLASMA FORMULARY|last=Huba|first=J.|date=2003|website=MIT Catalog|access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref> gives the total cross section in [[Barn_(unit)|barns]] as a function of the energy (in keV) of the incident particle towards a target ion at rest fit by the formula:\n\n<math>\\sigma^{NRL}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{A_5 + \\big( (A_4 - A_3 \\epsilon)^2 + 1) \\big)^{-1} A_2}{ \\epsilon (e^{A_1 \\epsilon^{-1/2} }-1)}</math> with the following coefficient values:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+NRL Formulary Cross Section Coefficients\n!\n!DT(1)\n!DD(2i)\n!DD(2ii)\n!DHe<sup>3</sup>(3)\n!TT(4)\n!THe<sup>3</sup>(6)\n|-\n|A1\n|45.95\n|46.097\n|47.88\n|89.27\n|38.39\n|123.1\n|-\n|A2\n|50200\n|372\n|482\n|25900\n|448\n|11250\n|-\n|A3\n|1.368e-2\n|4.36e-4\n|3.08e-4\n|3.98e-3\n|1.02e-3\n|0\n|-\n|A4\n|1.076\n|1.22\n|1.177\n|1.297\n|2.09\n|0\n|-\n|A5\n|409\n|0\n|0\n|647\n|0\n|0\n|}\nBosch-Hale<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Improved formulas for fusion cross-sections and thermal reactivities|journal=Nuclear Fusion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=611\u2013631|last=Bosch|first=H.

[[Aidan Quinn]] also stars, and it was directed by [[Jeremiah S. Chechik]].\n\nThe film is perhaps best known for Depp's humorous [[physical comedy]] routines (which are based on [[silent film]] comics [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]) and for popularizing, in the United States, the song \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\" by [[The Proclaimers]].<ref>\nhttp://toponehitwonders.com/pop/im-gonna-be-500-miles-the-proclaimers/</ref>\n''Benny & Joon'' was shot primarily on location in [[Spokane, Washington]], while the train scenes at the beginning were shot near [[Metaline Falls]], Washington.\n\n==Plot==\nBenjamin \"Benny\" Pearl and his mentally ill sister Juniper \"Joon\" Pearl, live together following the accidental death of their parents. Joon joins a poker game at a friend of Benny's named Mike's house and loses a bet that commits Sam, Mike's cousin, to live with the Pearls. Benny is at first angry, but after an evening with Sam at the local diner and then coming home the next day to find Sam has cleaned the house, Benny decides Sam should stay.\n\nJoon aids an illiterate Sam when he is struggling with writing to his mother, and the two go to the local diner where Ruthie is working. She takes them on an errand, and then takes them home. After Ruthie stays for dinner, her car won't start, and Benny drives her home, where they set a dinner date. Meanwhile, left alone, Joon and Sam kiss. Benny and Ruthie have a fun date, but it ends abruptly because Benny wants to get home to Joon. Sam goes to a video store to try to apply for a job there. Benny, Joon, and Sam go to a park where Sam starts doing tricks with his hat, attracting an appreciative crowd. Benny stays at the park to reflect and sends Joon home with Sam, where they make love. Sam then tells Joon he loves her which Joon reciprocates.\n\nWhen Benny makes suggestions to Sam about his comedy routines, Joon becomes agitated and makes Sam explain that he and Joon are romantically involved. An angry Benny throws Sam out, yells at Joon, and shows her a pamphlet about a group home that would be a better home for her. Joon starts hitting Benny and screaming, and he pushes her away. Feeling bad, Benny leaves to get her some tapioca. While Benny is away, Sam arrives. They pack suitcases and get on a bus, but Joon soon begins to hear voices in her head and argues with them, in great distress. Sam tries to soothe her, but she becomes more agitated. The bus is stopped, and two paramedics restrain Joon. When Benny arrives at the hospital, the doctor tells him Joon doesn't want to see him. He finds Sam in the waiting room, and they argue. Sam goes to stay with Ruthie. Meanwhile, Benny begins to feel guilty about his treatment of Joon.\n\nBenny finds Sam, now working at the video store, and asks for his help. They go to the hospital. Benny apologizes to Joon, persuades her to consider getting her own apartment, and tells her that Sam has come back for her. Joon tells the doctor that she would like to try living in her own apartment. Benny and Joon reconcile and Sam and Joon are reunited. Later, Benny brings roses to Ruthie. He takes another bouquet to Joon's apartment but leaves the flowers in the doorway when he sees Sam and Joon are busy making grilled cheese sandwiches with a clothing iron.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Sam\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Juniper \"Joon\" Pearl\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Benjamin \"Benny\" Pearl\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Ruthie\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Eric\n* [[C.C.H.

[[Aidan Quinn]] also stars, and it was directed by [[Jeremiah S. Chechik]].\n\nThe film is perhaps best known for Depp's humorous [[physical comedy]] routines (which are based on [[silent film]] comics [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]) and for popularizing, in the United States, the song \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\" by [[The Proclaimers]].<ref>\nhttp://toponehitwonders.com/pop/im-gonna-be-500-miles-the-proclaimers/</ref>\n''Benny & Joon'' was shot primarily on location in [[Spokane, Washington]], while the train scenes at the beginning were shot near [[Metaline Falls]], Washington.\n\n==Plot==\nBenjamin \"Benny\" Pearl and his mentally ill sister Juniper \"Joon\" Pearl, live together following the accidental death of their parents. Joon joins a poker game at a friend of Benny's named Mike's house and loses a bet that commits Sam, Mike's cousin, to live with the Pearls. Benny is at first angry, but after an evening with Sam at the local diner and then coming home the next day to find Sam has cleaned the house, Benny decides Sam should stay.\n\nJoon aids an illiterate Sam when he is struggling with writing to his mother, and the two go to the local diner where Ruthie is working. She takes them on an errand, and then takes them home. After Ruthie stays for dinner, her car won't start, and Benny drives her home, where they set a dinner date. Meanwhile, left alone, Joon and Sam kiss. Benny and Ruthie have a fun date, but it ends abruptly because Benny wants to get home to Joon. Sam goes to a video store to try and apply for a job there. Benny, Joon, and Sam go to a park where Sam starts doing tricks with his hat, attracting an appreciative crowd. Benny stays at the park to reflect and sends Joon home with Sam, where they make love. Sam then tells Joon he loves her which Joon reciprocates.\n\nWhen Benny makes suggestions to Sam about his comedy routines, Joon becomes agitated and makes Sam explain that he and Joon are romantically involved. An angry Benny throws Sam out, yells at Joon, and shows her a pamphlet about a group home that would be a better home for her. Joon starts hitting Benny and screaming, and he pushes her away. Feeling bad, Benny leaves to get her some tapioca. While Benny is away, Sam arrives. They pack suitcases and get on a bus, but Joon soon begins to hear voices in her head and argues with them, in great distress. Sam tries to soothe her, but she becomes more agitated. The bus is stopped, and two paramedics restrain Joon. When Benny arrives at the hospital, the doctor tells him Joon doesn't want to see him. He finds Sam in the waiting room, and they argue. Sam goes to stay with Ruthie. Meanwhile, Benny begins to feel guilty about his treatment of Joon.\n\nBenny finds Sam, now working at the video store, and asks for his help. They go to the hospital. Benny apologizes to Joon, persuades her to consider getting her own apartment, and tells her that Sam has come back for her. Joon tells the doctor that she would like to try living in her own apartment. Benny and Joon reconcile and Sam and Joon are reunited. Later, Benny brings roses to Ruthie. He takes another bouquet to Joon's apartment but leaves the flowers in the doorway when he sees Sam and Joon are busy making grilled cheese sandwiches with a clothing iron.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Sam\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Juniper \"Joon\" Pearl\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Benjamin \"Benny\" Pearl\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Ruthie\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Eric\n* [[C.C.H.

She was involved in a wide range of activities, including [[sly-grog shop|sly-grog]], [[razor gang]]s, and prostitution, and became a famous folk figure in Sydney during the interwar years.\n\n==Early life==\nDevine was born the daughter of bricklayer Edward Twiss, and Alice Twiss (n\u00e9e Tubb) at 57 Hollington Street, [[Camberwell]], London in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Writer|2001|p=23}}</ref><ref>Census 1901, Camberwell, St George, District 5, page 12</ref> At 16 she married an Australian serviceman, '''James (Jim) Edward Devine''', (born  [[Brunswick, Victoria]], 1892, died [[Melbourne]], 1966), on 12 April 1917 at the Sacred Heart Church, Camberwell, London. The couple had one son, born at Camberwell in 1919.\n\nHer career in prostitution began when she was a teenager and continued after she was married. She and many English women were usually found soliciting on the wide footpaths on The Strand, at night. From 1915 onwards to 1919, she spent time at Bow Street Court and Lock Up for prostitution, theft and assault.\n\nWhen Jim returned to Australia she followed him back on the bride ship ''Waimana'', arriving in Sydney on 13 January 1920. Her son stayed in London and was brought up by her parents.<ref name= bio>{{cite book |first1=Judith |last1=Allen |first2=Baiba |last2=Irving |title= Devine, Matilda (Mary) (1900 - 1970) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |chapter-url= http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080318b.htm |publisher=Australian National University |year=2011 |accessdate= 9 March 2008|chapter=Devine, Matilda Mary (Tilly) (1900\u20131970) }}</ref>  Both Tilly and Jim Devine rapidly became prominent illegal narcotics dealers, brothel owners and crime gangs members in the Sydney criminal milieu.\n\n==Criminal career==\n\nDevine became infamous in Sydney, initially as a prostitute, then later as a brothel madam and organised crime entrepreneur. The NSW Vagrancy Act 1905 prohibited men from running brothels; it did nothing to stop women with criminal gangs' support and bribes to the police from running criminal enterprises. Historian Larry Writer has noted that the Devines ran diversified operations. Elite \"call girls\" were available for politicians, businessmen and overseas guests of significance, while \"tenement girls\" were young working-class women who resorted to casual prostitution to supplement their drug spendings, clothings and meagre earnings during times of Australian criminal and narcotic culture, absence of a comprehensive welfare state and unemployment. Older female prostitutes, \"boat girls\", catered to itinerant sailors or working class-men. Devine does not seem to have run similar operations for the gay sex market during this time because she believed it was not right.<ref>{{harvnb|Writer|2009|p=200}}</ref>\n\nDevine's wealth was legendary, although it was all earned from crime. She owned much real estate in Sydney, many luxury cars, looted gold and diamond jewellery and travelled by ship in first class staterooms. Much of her wealth was also used to pay bribes to the police sectors, and fines for her criminal convictions that spanned fifty years. Devine faced numerous court summons and was convicted on 204 occasions during her long criminal career, and served many gaol sentences in New South Wales gaols, mainly for prostitution, violent assault, affray and attempted murder. She was known to the police to be of a violent nature and was known to use firearms.\n\n==Marriage to Jim Devine ==\n[[File:James Devine 1939.jpg|thumb|Jim Devine in 1939]]\nJim Devine was an ex-serviceman and shearer, who was a violent 'stand-over' man, a convicted thief, a pimp, drug dealer, vicious thug and gunman. He was also an alcoholic. Devine committed a number of high-profile murders in Sydney between 1929 and 1931: notably, the murder of criminal George Leonard \"Gregory\" Gaffney on 17 July 1929,<ref>{{cite news |work=Sydney Morning Herald |title=Funeral Notice.

On 9 January 1931, Jim was charged at Central Police Court with the attempted murder of his wife after a heated argument at their Maroubra home. As Tilly ran out of the house, Jim fired a number of shots at her in a similar way to the murder of George Leonard Gaffney in 1929. Tilly escaped unscathed, the only damage being one of her brand new stilettos - the left one. Their terrified neighbours called the police resulting in Jim being arrested and charged over the incident.

She was involved in a wide range of activities, including [[sly-grog shop|sly-grog]], [[razor gang]]s, and prostitution, and became a famous folk figure in Sydney during the interwar years.\n\n==Early life==\nDevine was born the daughter of bricklayer Edward Twiss, and Alice Twiss (n\u00e9e Tubb) at 57 Hollington Street, [[Camberwell]], London in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Writer|2001|p=23}}</ref><ref>Census 1901, Camberwell, St George, District 5, page 12</ref> At 16 she married an Australian serviceman, '''James (Jim) Edward Devine''', (born  [[Brunswick, Victoria]], 1892, died [[Melbourne]], 1966), on 12 April 1917 at the Sacred Heart Church, Camberwell, London. The couple had one son, born at Camberwell in 1919.\n\nHer career in prostitution began when she was a teenager and continued after she was married. She and many English women were usually found soliciting on the wide footpaths on The Strand, at night. From 1915 onwards to 1919, she spent time at Bow Street Court and Lock Up for prostitution, theft and assault.\n\nWhen Jim returned to Australia she followed him back on the bride ship ''Waimana'', arriving in Sydney on 13 January 1920. Her son stayed in London and was brought up by her parents.<ref name= bio>{{cite book |first1=Judith |last1=Allen |first2=Baiba |last2=Irving |title= Devine, Matilda (Mary) (1900 - 1970) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |chapter-url= http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080318b.htm |publisher=Australian National University |year=2011 |accessdate= 9 March 2008|chapter=Devine, Matilda Mary (Tilly) (1900\u20131970) }}</ref>  Both Tilly and Jim Devine rapidly became prominent illegal narcotics dealers, brothel owners and crime gangs members in the Sydney criminal milieu.\n\n==Criminal career==\n\nDevine became infamous in Sydney, initially as a prostitute, then later as a brothel madam and organised crime entrepreneur. The NSW Vagrancy Act 1905 prohibited men from running brothels; it did nothing to stop women with criminal gangs' support and bribes to the police from running criminal enterprises. Historian Larry Writer has noted that the Devines ran diversified operations. Elite \"call girls\" were available for politicians, businessmen and overseas guests of significance, while \"tenement girls\" were young working class women who resorted to casual prostitution to supplement their drug spendings, clothings and meagre earnings during times of Australian criminal and narcotic culture, absence of a comprehensive welfare state and unemployment. Older female prostitutes, \"boat girls\", catered to itinerant sailors or working class-men. Devine does not seem to have run similar operations for the gay sex market during this time because she believed it was not right.<ref>{{harvnb|Writer|2009|p=200}}</ref>\n\nDevine's wealth was legendary, although it was all earned from crime. She owned much real estate in Sydney, many luxury cars, looted gold and diamond jewellery and travelled by ship in first class staterooms. Much of her wealth was also used to pay bribes to the police sectors, and fines for her criminal convictions that spanned fifty years. Devine faced numerous court summons and was convicted on 204 occasions during her long criminal career, and served many gaol sentences in New South Wales gaols, mainly for prostitution, violent assault, affray and attempted murder. She was known to the police to be of a violent nature and was known to use firearms.\n\n==Marriage to Jim Devine ==\n[[File:James Devine 1939.jpg|thumb|Jim Devine in 1939]]\nJim Devine was an ex-serviceman and shearer, who was a violent 'stand-over' man, a convicted thief, a pimp, drug dealer, vicious thug and gunman. He was also an alcoholic. Devine committed a number of high-profile murders in Sydney between 1929 and 1931: notably, the murder of criminal George Leonard \"Gregory\" Gaffney on 17 July 1929,<ref>{{cite news |work=Sydney Morning Herald |title=Funeral Notice.

On 9 January 1931, Jim was charged at Central Police Court with the attempted murder of his wife after a heated argument at their Maroubra home. As Tilly ran out of the house, Jim fired a number of shots at her in a similar way to the murder of George Leonard Gaffney in 1929. Tilly escaped unscathed, the only damage being one of her brand new stilettos - the left one. Their terrified neighbours called the police resulting in Jim being arrested and charged over the incident. He was later acquitted, on 16 January 1931, because Tilly refused to testify.<ref>{{cite news |work=Sydney Morning Herald |title='HUSBAND CHARGED'.

A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the ''bit'' or ''blade'', which slides into the [[keyhole|keyway]] of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the ''bow'', which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key. The key serves as a [[security token]] for access to the locked area; only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock.

His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulford|first=Graham W.|title=High-Security Mechanical Locks : An Encyclopedic Reference|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-7506-8437-2|page=317}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chubb lock.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a [[Chubb detector lock]]]]\nThe lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in 1818. A burglary in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] prompted the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chubb developed the [[Chubb detector lock]], which incorporated an [[Combination lock#Internal mechanisms|integral security feature]] that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock's owner if it had been interfered with. Chubb was awarded \u00a3100 after a trained lock-picker failed to break the lock after 3 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/lock_making2|title=Lock Making: Chubb & Son's Lock & Safe Co Ltd|publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|year=2005|accessdate=16 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother [[Charles Chubb (businessman)|Charles]] in starting their own lock company, [[Chubb Locks|Chubb]]. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Roper, C.A. |author2=Phillips, Bill |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing|isbn=0-07-137494-9}}</ref> The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting [[safe]] and began production in 1835.\n\nThe designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but [[Joseph Bramah]], a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the \"Challenge Lock\" in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging \"...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock\" for the reward of \u00a3200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, the American locksmith [[Alfred Charles Hobbs]] was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.\n\nThe earliest patent for a double-acting [[pin tumbler lock]] was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Book of Home, Site, and Office Security: Selecting, Installing, and Troubleshooting Systems and Devices|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121072851/https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-11-21}}</ref> but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American [[Linus Yale Sr.]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Geek Atlas: 128 Places Where Science and Technology Come Alive|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=445|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501062428/https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-05-01}}</ref> This lock design used [[pin]]s of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. In 1861, [[Linus Yale Jr.]] was inspired by the original 1840s pin-tumbler lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/yale.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529222941/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/yale.html|archivedate=2013-05-29}}</ref> The modern Yale lock is essentially a more developed version of the Egyptian lock.\n\nDespite some improvement in key design since, the majority of locks today are still variants of the designs invented by Bramah, Chubb and Yale. Each locks combination is determined by the off-set of two small wheel-like apparatus. The change in position of the wheels on top of each other creates a unique combination for the lock.\n\n== Types of lock ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bicycle lock]]\n* [[Latch (hardware)#Cam lock|Cam lock]]\n* [[Gun safety#Locks|Chamber lock]]\n* [[Child safety lock]]\n* [[Chubb detector lock]]\n* [[Combination lock]]\n* [[Cylinder lock]]\n* [[Dead bolt]]\n* [[Electric strike]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Lever tumbler lock]]\n* [[Lock screen]]\n* [[Luggage lock]]\n* [[Magnetic keyed lock]]\n* [[Electromagnetic lock|Magnetic lock]]\n* [[Mortise lock]]\n* [[Padlock]]\n* [[Pin tumbler lock]]\n* [[Police lock]]\n* [[Protector lock]]\n* [[Rim lock]]\n* [[Time lock]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===With physical keys===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nPin tumbler no key.svg|Pin tumbler lock: without a key in the lock, the driver pins (blue) are pushed downwards, preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating.  An additional pin called the master pin is present between the key and driver pins in locks that accept master keys to allow the plug to rotate at multiple pin elevations.\nDisc tumbler locked.png|Wafer tumbler lock: without a key in the lock, the wafers (red) are pushed down by springs. The wafers nestle into a groove in the lower part of the outer cylinder (green) preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating.\nTubular locked.png|Tubular lock: the key pins (red) and driver pins (blue) are pushed towards the front of the lock, preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating. The tubular key has several half-cylinder indentations which align with the pins.\n</gallery>\nA [[warded lock]] uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed [[skeleton key]] can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks.\n\nThe [[pin tumbler lock]] uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the [[Warded lock|wards]] in the [[keyway]] allowing or denying entry to the [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called [[Bit (key)|bitting]]s, then allow [[Pin tumbler lock|pins]] to move up and down until they are in line with the [[Shear line (locksmithing)|shear line]] of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or [[cam]] to rotate freely and the lock to open.\n\nA [[wafer tumbler lock]] is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.\n\nThe [[disc tumbler lock]] or [[Abloy]] lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs.\n\nThe [[lever tumbler lock]] uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly [[Mortise lock|recessed]] inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.\n\nA [[magnetic keyed lock]] is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock's internal tumblers thus releasing the lock.\n\n===With electronic keys===\nAn [[electronic lock]] works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an [[access control]] system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the [[dead bolt|bolt]] or [[cylinder lock|cylinder]] to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following:\n\nA [[keycard lock]] operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a [[credit card]]. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the '''keycard'''.\n\nThe lock in a typical [[remote keyless system]] operates with a [[smart key]] radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different [[rolling code]] every time the button is pressed.\nGenerally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key.\nThe ignition switch may require a [[transponder car key]] to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission.\n\nA smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with [[smartphones]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ditch the keys: it's time to get a smart lock|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|website=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=26 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216010141/http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kisi And KeyMe, two smart phone apps, might make house keys obsolete|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|archivedate=11 March 2015}}</ref> Smart locks are used in [[coworking]] spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurutz|first1=Steven|title=Losing The Key|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103232758/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|archivedate=3 January 2016}}</ref>  In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools.\n\n== Locksmithing ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Mendel I 072 v.jpg|thumb|Locksmith, 1451]]\n[[Locksmithing]] is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an [[apprenticeship]]. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/locksmith-qualifications/|title=What qualifications do I need to be a locksmith?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full [[diploma]] from an [[engineering]] [[college]]. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHistorically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service [[electronic lock]]s by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.\n\nAlthough the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a \"security layer\" that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder.\n\n===Key duplication===\n{{main|Key duplication}}\n[[File:Copia llave video.ogv|thumb|Video showing the process of cutting a key]]\n\nTraditional '''key cutting''' is the primary method of key duplication. It is a [[subtractive manufacturing|subtractive process]] named after the metalworking process of [[metalworking#Cutting processes|cutting]], where a flat ''blank'' key is ground down to form the same shape as the ''template'' (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages:\n# The original key is fitted into a [[vice]] in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked.\n# The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key's shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices.\n# After cutting, the new key is [[burr (metal)|deburred]] by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks.\n\nModern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced.  The capability to store electronic copies of the key's shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image.\n\nDifferent key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators.\n\nKey duplication is available in many retail [[hardware stores]] and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]]|alt=]]\n\n===Heraldry===\nKeys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best-known being that of the [[Holy See]]&nbsp;\u2013 derived from the phrase in {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:19}} which promises [[Saint Peter]], in Roman Catholic tradition the first [[pope]], the [[Keys of Heaven]].

A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the ''bit'' or ''blade'', which slides into the [[keyhole|keyway]] of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the ''bow'', which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key. The key serves as a [[security token]] for access to the locked area; only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock.

His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulford|first=Graham W.|title=High-Security Mechanical Locks : An Encyclopedic Reference|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-7506-8437-2|page=317}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chubb lock.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a [[Chubb detector lock]]]]\nThe lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in 1818. A burglary in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] prompted the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chubb developed the [[Chubb detector lock]], which incorporated an [[Combination lock#Internal mechanisms|integral security feature]] that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock's owner if it had been interfered with. Chubb was awarded \u00a3100 after a trained lock-picker failed to break the lock after 3 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/lock_making2|title=Lock Making: Chubb & Son's Lock & Safe Co Ltd|publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|year=2005|accessdate=16 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother [[Charles Chubb (businessman)|Charles]] in starting their own lock company, [[Chubb Locks|Chubb]]. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Roper, C.A. |author2=Phillips, Bill |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing|isbn=0-07-137494-9}}</ref> The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting [[safe]] and began production in 1835.\n\nThe designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but [[Joseph Bramah]], a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the \"Challenge Lock\" in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging \"...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock\" for the reward of \u00a3200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, the American locksmith [[Alfred Charles Hobbs]] was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.\n\nThe earliest patent for a double-acting [[pin tumbler lock]] was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Book of Home, Site, and Office Security: Selecting, Installing, and Troubleshooting Systems and Devices|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121072851/https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-11-21}}</ref> but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American [[Linus Yale Sr.]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Geek Atlas: 128 Places Where Science and Technology Come Alive|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=445|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501062428/https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-05-01}}</ref> This lock design used [[pin]]s of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. In 1861, [[Linus Yale Jr.]] was inspired by the original 1840s pin-tumbler lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/yale.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529222941/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/yale.html|archivedate=2013-05-29}}</ref> The modern Yale lock is essentially a more developed version of the Egyptian lock.\n\nDespite some improvement in key design since, the majority of locks today are still variants of the designs invented by Bramah, Chubb and Yale. Each locks combination is determined by the off-set of two small wheel-like apparatus. The change in position of the wheels on top of each other creates a unique combination for the lock.\n\n== Types of lock ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bicycle lock]]\n* [[Latch (hardware)#Cam lock|Cam lock]]\n* [[Gun safety#Locks|Chamber lock]]\n* [[Child safety lock]]\n* [[Chubb detector lock]]\n* [[Combination lock]]\n* [[Cylinder lock]]\n* [[Dead bolt]]\n* [[Electric strike]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Lever tumbler lock]]\n* [[Lock screen]]\n* [[Luggage lock]]\n* [[Magnetic keyed lock]]\n* [[Electromagnetic lock|Magnetic lock]]\n* [[Mortise lock]]\n* [[Padlock]]\n* [[Pin tumbler lock]]\n* [[Police lock]]\n* [[Protector lock]]\n* [[Rim lock]]\n* [[Time lock]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===With physical keys===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nPin tumbler no key.svg|Pin tumbler lock: without a key in the lock, the driver pins (blue) are pushed downwards, preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating.  An additional pin called the master pin is present between the key and driver pins in locks that accept master keys to allow the plug to rotate at multiple pin elevations.\nDisc tumbler locked.png|Wafer tumbler lock: without a key in the lock, the wafers (red) are pushed down by springs.

The tubular key has several half-cylinder indentations which align with the pins.\n</gallery>\nA [[warded lock]] uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed [[skeleton key]] can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks.\n\nThe [[pin tumbler lock]] uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the [[Warded lock|wards]] in the [[keyway]] allowing or denying entry to the [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called [[Bit (key)|bitting]]s, then allow [[Pin tumbler lock|pins]] to move up and down until they are in line with the [[Shear line (locksmithing)|shear line]] of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or [[cam]] to rotate freely and the lock to open.\n\nA [[wafer tumbler lock]] is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.\n\nThe [[disc tumbler lock]] or [[Abloy]] lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs.\n\nThe [[lever tumbler lock]] uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly [[Mortise lock|recessed]] inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.\n\nA [[magnetic keyed lock]] is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock's internal tumblers thus releasing the lock.\n\n===With electronic keys===\nAn [[electronic lock]] works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an [[access control]] system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the [[dead bolt|bolt]] or [[cylinder lock|cylinder]] to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following:\n\nA [[keycard lock]] operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a [[credit card]]. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the '''keycard'''.\n\nThe lock in a typical [[remote keyless system]] operates with a [[smart key]] radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different [[rolling code]] every time the button is pressed.\nGenerally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key.\nThe ignition switch may require a [[transponder car key]] to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission.\n\nA smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with [[smartphones]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ditch the keys: it's time to get a smart lock|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|website=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=26 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216010141/http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kisi And KeyMe, two smart phone apps, might make house keys obsolete|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|archivedate=11 March 2015}}</ref> Smart locks are used in [[coworking]] spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurutz|first1=Steven|title=Losing The Key|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103232758/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|archivedate=3 January 2016}}</ref>  In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools.\n\n== Locksmithing ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Mendel I 072 v.jpg|thumb|Locksmith, 1451]]\n[[Locksmithing]] is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an [[apprenticeship]]. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/locksmith-qualifications/|title=What qualifications do I need to be a locksmith?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full [[diploma]] from an [[engineering]] [[college]]. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHistorically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service [[electronic lock]]s by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.\n\nAlthough the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a \"security layer\" that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder.\n\n===Key duplication===\n{{main|Key duplication}}\n[[File:Copia llave video.ogv|thumb|Video showing the process of cutting a key]]\n\nTraditional '''key cutting''' is the primary method of key duplication. It is a [[subtractive manufacturing|subtractive process]] named after the metalworking process of [[metalworking#Cutting processes|cutting]], where a flat ''blank'' key is ground down to form the same shape as the ''template'' (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages:\n# The original key is fitted into a [[vice]] in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked.\n# The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key's shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices.\n# After cutting, the new key is [[burr (metal)|deburred]] by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks.\n\nModern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced.  The capability to store electronic copies of the key's shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image.\n\nDifferent key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators.\n\nKey duplication is available in many retail [[hardware stores]] and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]]|alt=]]\n\n===Heraldry===\nKeys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best-known being that of the [[Holy See]]&nbsp;\u2013 derived from the phrase in {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:19}} which promises [[Saint Peter]], in Roman Catholic tradition the first [[pope]], the [[Keys of Heaven]].
