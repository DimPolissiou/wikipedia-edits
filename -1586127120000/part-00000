Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of [[mesmerism]] entirely benign.<ref>Robert Peel, ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, Chapter 6, Sections I, II.<!--page?--></ref>\n\nQuimby wrote in 1864, \"The wise man, in like measure&nbsp;... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man.

Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as [[Christian Science Practitioner]]s in the church's periodical, ''[[The Christian Science Journal]]''.

In a celebrated case (1878) that earned her much negative publicity, she took part in a [[Salem witchcraft trial (1878)|lawsuit against Spofford]], claiming that he deliberately practiced malicious mesmerism on one of her unhealed patients, Lucretia Brown.

She wrote that she had suffered from chronic indigestion as a child and, hoping to cure it, had embarked on a diet of nothing but water, bread, and vegetables, at one point consumed just once a day: \"Thus we passed most of our early years, as many can attest, in hunger, pain, weakness, and starvation.\"<ref>Mary Baker Eddy, [http://www.mbeinstitute.org/ScienceAndHealth/SandH.htm ''Science and Health''], 1st edition, Christian Science Publishing Company, 1875, 189\u2013190.</ref>\n\nEddy experienced near invalidism as a child and most of her life until her discovery of Christian Science.  Like most life experiences, it formed her lifelong, diligent research for a remedy from almost constant suffering. Eddy writes in her autobiography, \"From my very childhood I was impelled by a hunger and thirst after divine things, - a desire for something higher and better than matter, and apart from it, - to seek diligently for the knowledge of God as the one great and ever-present relief from human woe.\" She also writes on page 33 of the chapter, \"Medical Experiments,\" in her autobiography, \"I wandered through the dim mazes of 'materia medica,' till I was weary of 'scientific guessing,' as it has been well called. I sought knowledge from the different schools, - allopathy, homeopathy, hydropathy, electricity, and from various humbugs, - but without receiving satisfaction.\"<ref>(Retrospection and Instrospection, Copyright 1901, by Mary Baker G.

My favorite studies were natural philosophy, logic, and moral science. From my brother Albert, I received lessons in the ancient tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.<ref>Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 10.</ref>}}\n\nBates and Dittemore write that Eddy was not able to attend Sanbornton Academy when the family first moved there, but was required instead to start at the district school (in the same building) with the youngest girls. She withdrew after a month because of poor health, then received private tuition from the Reverend Enoch Corser.  She entered Sanbornton Academy in 1842.<ref>Bates and Dittemore 1932, 16\u201317, 25.</ref>\n\nShe was received into the Congregational church in Tilton on 26 July 1838 when she was 17, according to church records published by ''McClure's'' in 1907. Eddy had written in her autobiography in 1891 that she was 12 when this happened, and that she had discussed the idea of [[predestination]] with the pastor during the examination for her membership; this may have been an attempt to reflect the story of a 12-year-old [[Finding in the Temple|Jesus in the Temple]].<ref>Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 14\u201315; Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', January 1907, 237.</ref> She wrote in response to the ''McClure's'' article that the date of her church membership may have been mistaken by her.<ref>Eddy, ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'', 311: \"My reply to the statement that the clerk's book shows that I joined the Tilton Congregational Church at the age of seventeen is that my religious experience seemed to culminate at twelve years of age. Hence a mistake may have occurred as to the exact date of my first church membership.\"</ref> Eddy objected so strongly to the idea of predestination and eternal damnation that it made her ill:\n\n{{quote|My mother, as she bathed my burning temples, bade me lean on God's love, which would give me rest if I went to Him in prayer, as I was wont to do, seeking His guidance. I prayed; and a soft glow of ineffable joy came over me. The fever was gone and I rose and dressed myself in a normal condition of health. Mother saw this and was glad. The physician marveled; and the \"horrible decree\" of Predestination \u2013 as John Calvin rightly called his own tenet \u2013 forever lost its power over me.<ref>Eddy ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 14</ref>}}\n\n===Marriage, widowhood===\n[[File:Mary Baker G.

In 1844, her first husband George Washington Glover (a friend of her brother Samuel) died after six months of marriage. They had married in December 1843 and set up home in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where Glover had business, but he died of [[yellow fever]] in June 1844 while living in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Eddy was with him in Wilmington, six months pregnant. She had to make her way back to New Hampshire, 1,400 miles by train and steamboat, where her only child George Washington II was born on 12 September in her father's home.<ref>Gottschalk 2006, 62\u201363; Gill 1998, xxix, 68\u201369</ref>\n\nHer husband's death, the journey back, and the birth left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she ended up bedridden for months.<ref>Gottschalk 2006, 63.</ref> She tried to earn a living by writing articles for the New Hampshire ''Patriot'' and various [[Odd Fellows]] and [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] publications. She also worked as a [[substitute teacher]] in the [[New Hampshire Conference Seminary]], and ran her own [[kindergarten]] for a few months in 1846, apparently refusing to use [[corporal punishment]].<ref>Gill 1998, 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nThen her mother died in November 1849. Eddy wrote to one of her brothers: \"What is left of earth to ''me''!\" Her mother's death was followed three weeks later by the death of her fianc\u00e9, lawyer John Bartlett.<ref>Gottschalk 2006, 64.</ref> In 1850, Eddy wrote, her son was sent away to be looked after by the family's nurse; he was four years old by then.<ref>Eddy ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 20.</ref> Sources differ as to whether Eddy could have prevented this.<ref name=\"Fraser 1999, 38\">Fraser 1999, 38.</ref> It was difficult for a woman in her circumstances to earn money and, according to the legal doctrine of [[coverture]], women in the United States during this period could not be their own children's guardians.

Abigail apparently also declined to take George, then six years old.<ref name=Gill1998p86/> Eddy married again in 1853. Her second husband, Daniel Patterson, was a dentist and apparently said that he would become George's legal guardian; but he appears not to have gone ahead with this, and Eddy lost contact with her son when the family that looked after him, the Cheneys, moved to Minnesota, and then her son several years later enlisted in the Union army during the Civil War. She did not see him again until he was in his thirties:\n\n{{quote|My dominant thought in marrying again was to get back my child, but after our marriage his stepfather was not willing he should have a home with me. A plot was consummated for keeping us apart. The family to whose care he was committed very soon removed to what was then regarded as the Far West.\n\nAfter his removal a letter was read to my little son, informing him that his mother was dead and buried. Without my knowledge a guardian was appointed him, and I was then informed that my son was lost. Every means within my power was employed to find him, but without success. We never met again until he had reached the age of thirty-four, had a wife and two children, and by a strange providence had learned that his mother still lived, and came to see me in Massachusetts.<ref name=Eddy1891p20/>}}\n\n==Study with Phineas Quimby==\n[[File:Phineas Parkhurst Quimby.jpg|180px|thumb|alt=photograph|Eddy's methods are seen as derived from the ideas of [[Phineas Quimby]] and [[homeopathy]].<ref>Rennie Schoepflin, \"Christian Science\", in Paul S.

From 1862 to 1865, Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods practiced by Quimby and others. The extent to which he influenced her is much debated. Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of [[mesmerism]] entirely benign.<ref>Robert Peel, ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, Chapter 6, Sections I, II.<!--page?--></ref>\n\nQuimby wrote in 1864, \"The wise man, in like measure&nbsp;... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man. Our misery lies in this darkness. This is the prison that holds the natural man, till the light of Wisdom bursts his bonds, and lets the captive free. Here is where Christ went to preach to the prisoners bound by error before the reformation of science.\"<ref>Quimby papers, Library of Congress, Vol. 6, 112.</ref> In a letter to the ''Portland Evening Courier'' in November 1862, Eddy wrote: \"With this physical and mental depression I first visited P. P. Quimby, and in less than one week from that time I ascended by a stairway of one hundred and eighty-two-steps to the dome of the City Hall, and am improving ad infinitum. To the most subtle reasoning, such a proof, coupled to as it is with numberless similar ones, demonstrates his power to heal.\"<ref>Paul Buchanan, ''American Women's Rights Movement: A Chronology of Events and of Opportunities from 1600 to 2008'', Branden Books, 2009, 80\u201381.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Mary Baker Eddy, c. 1864.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=photograph|Eddy around 1864]]\nShe wrote in a letter in 1864: \"I am up and about today, i.e., by the help of the Lord.\"<ref>Lyman Powell, ''Christian science, the faith and its founder'', G.P. Putnam's sons, 1917, 31.</ref> Eddy denied mesmerism in another letter to the ''Portland Evening Courier'', claiming that Christ was the cure:\n\n{{quote|P. P. Quimby stands upon the plane of wisdom with his truth. Christ healed the sick, but not by jugglery or with drugs. As the former speaks as never man before spake, and heals as never man healed since. Christ, is he not identified with truth, and is not this the Christ which is in him? We know that in wisdom is life, `and the life was the light of man.' P. P. Quimby rolls away the stone from the sepulchre of error, and health is the resurrection. But we also know that light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.<ref>Cather and Milmine 1909, 60.</ref>}}\n\nQuimby had his own notions concerning the nature of these unseen forces which Eddy accepted early on, but she later drew decidedly different opinions on the nature of thought on the body and rejected any form of [[hypnotism]]. It is evident that Eddy and Quimby worked together, appreciated one another, and learned from one another. Quimby reportedly later said that he learned more from Eddy than she did from him. Eddy clearly respected him and, at one point, referred to him as an \"advanced thinker\" with a \"high and noble character\".<ref>Peel 1971, 172, 183.</ref> She later disavowed the hypnotic aspect of Quimby's methods. In ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,'' she calls hypnotism mere deception practiced by those who aim to control the patient: \"The Christian Scientist demonstrates that divine Mind heals, while the hypnotist dispossesses the patient of his individuality in order to control him.\"<ref>Mary Baker Eddy, \"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,\" 375.</ref>\n\n==Fall in Lynn==\nOn February 1, 1866, Eddy slipped and fell on ice while walking in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], causing a spinal injury:\n\n{{quote|On the third day thereafter, I called for my Bible, and opened it at Matthew, 9:2 [And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.<small>(King James Bible) </small>].
