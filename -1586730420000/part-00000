The experiment was designed to investigate peculiar consequences of the well-known [[double-slit experiment]] in quantum mechanics, as well as the consequences of [[quantum entanglement]].\n\nThe delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment investigates a paradox. If a photon manifests itself as though it had come by a single path to the detector, then \"common sense\" (which Wheeler and others challenge) says that it must have entered the double-slit device as a particle. If a photon manifests itself as though it had come by two indistinguishable paths, then it must have entered the double-slit device as a wave. If the experimental apparatus is changed while the photon is in mid\u2011flight, then the photon should reverse its original \"decision\" as to whether to be a wave or a particle. Wheeler pointed out that when these assumptions are applied to a device of interstellar dimensions, a last-minute decision made on Earth on how to observe a photon could alter a decision made millions or even billions of years ago.\n\nWhile delayed-choice experiments have confirmed the seeming ability of measurements made on photons in the present to alter events occurring in the past, this requires a non-standard view of quantum mechanics. If a photon in flight is interpreted as being in a so-called \"superposition of states\", i.e. if it is interpreted as something that has the potentiality to manifest as a particle or wave, but during its time in flight is neither, then there is no time paradox. This is the standard view, and recent experiments have supported it.{{clarify|date=October 2015}}<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Our results demonstrate that the viewpoint that the system photon behaves either definitely as a wave or definitely as a particle would require faster-than-light communication.

If a detection screen (anything from a sheet of white paper to a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) is put on the other side of the double-slit wall (far enough for light from both slits to overlap), a pattern of light and dark fringes will be observed, a pattern that is called an ''interference pattern''.

Rather than attempting to ''observe'' which photon was entering each slit (thus disturbing them), they proposed to \"mark\" them with information that, in principle at least, would allow the photons to be distinguished after passing through the slits. Lest there be any misunderstanding, the interference pattern does disappear when the photons are so marked. However, the interference pattern reappears if the which-path information is further manipulated ''after'' the marked photons have passed through the double slits to obscure the which-path markings.

If one thinks in terms of a stream of photons being randomly directed by such a beam splitter to go down two paths that are kept from interaction, it would seem that no photon can then interfere with any other or with itself.\n\nHowever, if the rate of photon production is reduced so that only one photon is entering the apparatus at any one time, it becomes impossible to understand the photon as only moving through one path, because when the path outputs are redirected so that they coincide on a common detector or detectors, interference phenomena appear. This is similar to envisioning one photon in a two-slit apparatus: even though it is one photon, it still somehow interacts with both slits.\n\n[[Image:Beam Split and fuse.svg|200px|thumb|Figure 1. Experiment that shows delayed determination of photon path]]\n\nIn the two diagrams in Fig. 1, photons are emitted one at a time from a laser symbolized by a yellow star. They pass through a 50% beam splitter (green block) that reflects or transmits 1/2 of the photons.  The reflected or transmitted photons travel along two possible paths depicted by the red or blue lines.\n\nIn the top diagram, it seems as though the trajectories of the photons are known: If a photon emerges from the top of the apparatus, it seems as though it had to have come by way of the blue path, and if it emerges from the side of the apparatus, seem as though it had to have come by way of the red path. However, it is important to keep in mind that the photon is in a superposition of the paths until it is detected. The assumption above\u2014that it 'had to have come by way of' either path\u2014is a form of the 'separation fallacy'.\n\nIn the bottom diagram, a second beam splitter is introduced at the top right.  It recombines the beams corresponding to the red and blue paths. By introducing the second beam splitter, the usual way of thinking is that the path information has been \"erased\"\u2014however we have to be careful, because the photon cannot be assumed to have 'really' gone along one or the other path. Recombining the beams  results in interference phenomena at detection screens positioned just beyond each exit port. What issues to the right side displays reinforcement, and what issues toward the top displays cancellation. It is important to keep in mind however that the illustrated interferometer effects apply only to a single photon in a pure state. When dealing with a pair of entangled photons, the photon encountering the interferometer will be in a mixed state, and there will be no visible interference pattern without coincidence counting to select appropriate subsets of the data.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jacques |first1=Vincent |last2=Wu |first2=E |last3=Grosshans |first3=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last4=Treussart |first4=Fran\u00e7ois |last5=Grangier |first5=Philippe |last6=Aspect |first6=Alain |last7=Rochl |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |year=2007 |title=Experimental Realization of Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment |journal=Science |pmid=17303748 |volume=315 |issue=5814 |pages=966\u2013968  |doi=10.1126/science.1136303 |arxiv = quant-ph/0610241 |bibcode = 2007Sci...315..966J }}</ref>\n\n===Delayed choice===\nElementary precursors to current quantum-eraser experiments such as the \"simple quantum eraser\" described above have straightforward classical-wave explanations.

Versions of the quantum eraser using entangled photons, however, are intrinsically non-classical. Because of that, in order to avoid any possible ambiguity concerning the quantum versus classical interpretation, most experimenters have opted to use nonclassical entangled-photon light sources to demonstrate quantum erasers with no classical analog.\n\nFurthermore, use of entangled photons enables the design and implementation of versions of the quantum eraser that are impossible to achieve with single-photon interference, such as the '''delayed-choice quantum eraser''', which is the topic of this article.\n\n==The experiment of Kim ''et al.'' (1999)==\n{{clear}}\n[[Image:Kim EtAl Quantum Eraser.svg|401px|thumb|Figure 2. Setup of the delayed-choice quantum-eraser experiment of Kim ''et al.'' Detector D<sub>0</sub> is movable]]\n\nThe experimental setup, described in detail in Kim ''et al.'',<ref name=\"DCQE\" /> is illustrated in Fig 2. An argon laser generates individual 351.1&nbsp;nm photons that pass through a double-slit apparatus (vertical black line in the upper left corner of the diagram).\n\nAn individual photon goes through one (or both) of the two slits. In the illustration, the photon paths are color-coded as red or light blue lines to indicate which slit the photon came through (red indicates slit A, light blue indicates slit B).\n\nSo far, the experiment is like a conventional two-slit experiment. However, after the slits, [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]] (SPDC) is used to prepare an entangled two-photon state. This is done by a nonlinear optical crystal BBO ([[beta barium borate]]) that converts the photon (from either slit) into two identical, orthogonally polarized [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] photons with 1/2 the frequency of the original photon. The paths followed by these orthogonally polarized photons are caused to diverge by the [[Glan\u2013Thompson prism]].\n\nOne of these 702.2&nbsp;nm photons, referred to as the \"signal\" photon (look at the red and light-blue lines going ''upwards'' from the Glan\u2013Thompson prism) continues to the target detector called ''D''<sub>0</sub>. During an experiment, detector ''D''<sub>0</sub> is scanned along its ''x'' axis, its motions controlled by a step motor. A plot of \"signal\" photon counts detected by ''D''<sub>0</sub> versus ''x'' can be examined to discover whether the cumulative signal forms an interference pattern.\n\nThe other entangled photon, referred to as the \"idler\" photon (look at the red and light-blue lines going ''downwards'' from the Glan\u2013Thompson prism), is deflected by prism ''PS'' that sends it along divergent paths depending on whether it came from slit ''A'' or slit ''B''.\n\nSomewhat beyond the path split, the idler photons encounter [[beam splitter]]s ''BS''<sub>a</sub>, ''BS''<sub>b</sub>, and ''BS''<sub>c</sub> that each have a 50% chance of allowing the idler photon to pass through and a 50% chance of causing it to be reflected. ''M''<sub>a</sub> and ''M''<sub>b</sub> are mirrors.\n\n[[File:KimDelayedChoiceQuantumEraserGraphsSVG.svg|right|thumb|268px|Figure 3. ''x'' axis: position of ''D''<sub>0</sub>.

''R''<sub>04</sub> is not provided in the Kim article and is supplied according to their verbal description.]]\n[[File:KimDelayedChoiceQuantumEraserGraphsGIF.gif|right|thumb|268px|Figure 4.

Note that:\n* If an idler photon is recorded at detector ''D''<sub>3</sub>, it can only have come from slit B.\n* If an idler photon is recorded at detector ''D''<sub>4</sub>, it can only have come from slit A.\n* If an idler photon is detected at detector ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>, it might have come from slit A or slit B.\n* The optical path length measured from slit to ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub>, and ''D''<sub>4</sub> is 2.5&nbsp;m longer than the optical path length from slit to ''D''<sub>0</sub>. This means that any information that one can learn from an idler photon must be approximately 8&nbsp;ns later than what one can learn from its entangled signal photon.\n\nDetection of the idler photon by ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub> provides delayed \"which-path information\" indicating whether the signal photon with which it is entangled had gone through slit A or B. On the other hand, detection of the idler photon by ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub> provides a delayed indication that such information is not available for its entangled signal photon. Insofar as which-path information had earlier potentially been available from the idler photon, it is said that the information has been subjected to a \"delayed erasure\".\n\nBy using a [[coincidence counting (physics)|coincidence counter]], the experimenters were able to isolate the entangled signal from photo-noise, recording only events where both signal and idler photons were detected (after compensating for the 8&nbsp;ns delay). Refer to Figs&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4.\n* When the experimenters looked at the signal photons whose entangled idlers were detected at ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>, they detected interference patterns.\n* However, when they looked at the signal photons whose entangled idlers were detected at ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>, they detected simple diffraction patterns with no interference.\n\n===Significance===\nThis result is similar to that of the double-slit experiment, since interference is observed when it is not known from which slit the photon originates, while no interference is observed when the path is known.\n\n[[File:Detector0RawResults.svg|left|thumb|Figure 5. Distribution of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub> can be compared with distribution of bulbs on [[digital billboard]]. When all the bulbs are lit, billboard does not reveal any pattern of image, which can be \"recovered\" only by switching off some bulbs. Likewise interference pattern or no-interference pattern among signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub> can be recovered only after \"switching off\" (or ignoring) some signal photons and which signal photons should be ignored to recover pattern, this information can be gained only by looking at corresponding entangled idler photons in detectors ''D''<sub>1</sub> to ''D''<sub>4</sub>.]]\n\nHowever, what makes this experiment possibly astonishing is that, unlike in the classic double-slit experiment, the choice of whether to preserve or erase the which-path information of the idler was not made until 8&nbsp;ns ''after'' the position of the signal photon had already been measured by ''D''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nDetection of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub> does not directly yield any which-path information. Detection of idler photons at ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>, which provide which-path information, means that no interference pattern can be observed in the jointly detected subset of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub>. Likewise, detection of idler photons at ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>, which do not provide which-path information, means that interference patterns ''can'' be observed in the jointly detected subset of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nIn other words, even though an idler photon is not observed until long after its entangled signal photon arrives at ''D''<sub>0</sub> due to the shorter optical path for the latter, interference at ''D''<sub>0</sub> is determined by whether a signal photon's entangled idler photon is detected at a detector that preserves its which-path information (''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>), or at a detector that erases its which-path information (''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>).\n\nSome have interpreted this result to mean that the delayed choice to observe or not observe the path of the idler photon changes the outcome of an event in the past.<ref name=Ionicioiu2011>{{cite journal |last=Ionicioiu |first=R. |author2=Terno, D.

One of the most enticing experiments of this kind is the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser designed by Yoon-Ho Kim et. al (2000). It is a rather complicated construction. It is set up to measure correlated pairs of photons, which are in an entangled state, so that one of the two photons is detected 8 nanoseconds before its partner. The results of the experiment are quite amazing. They seem to indicate that the behavior of the photons detected these 8 nanoseconds before their partners is determined by how the partners will be detected. Indeed it might be tempting to interpret these results as an example of the future causing the past. The result is, however, in accordance with the predictions of quantum mechanics.\" http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-backwards/.</ref>  If events at ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub>, ''D''<sub>4</sub> determine outcomes at ''D''<sub>0</sub>, then effect seems to precede cause. If the idler light paths were greatly extended so that a year goes by before a photon shows up at ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub>, or ''D''<sub>4</sub>, then when a photon shows up in one of these detectors, it would cause a signal photon to have shown up in a certain mode a year earlier. Alternatively, knowledge of the future fate of the idler photon would determine the activity of the signal photon in its own present. Neither of these ideas conforms to the usual human expectation of causality. However, knowledge of the future, which would be a hidden variable, was refuted in experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A quantum delayed choice experiment |journal=Science |volume=338 |issue=6107 |pages=634\u2013637 |arxiv=1205.4926 |last1=Peruzzo |first1=Alberto |last2= Shadbolt |first2=Peter J. |last3=Brunner |first3=Nicolas |last4=Popescu |first4=Sandu |last5= O'Brien |first5=Jeremy L. |year=2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1226719 |pmid=23118183 |bibcode=2012Sci...338..634P}}</ref>\n\nExperiments that involve [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] exhibit phenomena that may make some people doubt their ordinary ideas about causal sequence. In the delayed-choice quantum eraser, an interference pattern will form on ''D''<sub>0</sub> even if which-path data pertinent to photons that form it are only erased later in time than the signal photons that hit the primary detector. Not only that feature of the experiment is puzzling; ''D''<sub>0</sub> can, in principle at least, be on one side of the universe, and the other four detectors can be \"on the other side of the universe\" to each other.<ref name=Greene2004>{{cite book |last=Greene |first=Brian |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos |url=https://archive.org/details/fabricofcosmossp00gree |url-access=registration |year=2004 |publisher=Alfred A.

Specifically, in the case when detection/deletion of which-way information happens ''before'' the detection on ''D''<sub>0</sub>, the standard simplistic explanation says \"The detector ''D''<sub>i</sub>, at which the idler photon is detected, determines the probability distribution at ''D''<sub>0</sub> for the signal photon\". Similarly, in the case when ''D''<sub>0</sub> ''precedes'' detection of the idler photon, the following description is just as accurate: \"The position at ''D''<sub>0</sub> of the detected signal photon determines the probabilities for the idler photon to hit either of ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>\". These are just equivalent ways of formulating the correlations of entangled photons' observables in an intuitive causal way, so one may choose any of those (in particular, that one where the cause precedes the consequence and no retrograde action appears in the explanation).\n\nThe total pattern of signal photons at the primary detector never shows interference (see Fig. 5), so ''it is not possible to deduce what will happen to the idler photons by observing the signal photons alone''. The delayed-choice quantum eraser does not communicate information in a retro-causal manner because it takes another signal, one which must arrive by a process that can go no faster than the speed of light, to sort the superimposed data in the signal photons into four streams that reflect the states of the idler photons at their four distinct detection screens.<ref group=note>\"...&nbsp;the future measurements do not in any way change the data you collected today. But the future measurements ''do'' influence the kinds of details you can invoke when you subsequently describe what happened today. Before you have the results of the idler photon measurements, you really can't say anything at all about the which-path history of any given signal photon. However, once you have the results, you conclude that signal photons whose idler partners were successfully used to ascertain which-path information ''can'' be described as having&nbsp;... traveled either left or right. You also conclude that signal photons whose idler partners had their which-path information erased ''cannot'' be described as having&nbsp;... definitely gone one way or the other (a conclusion you can convincingly confirm by using the newly acquired idler photon data to expose the previously hidden interference pattern among this latter class of signal photons).

The experiment was designed to investigate peculiar consequences of the well-known [[double-slit experiment]] in quantum mechanics, as well as the consequences of [[quantum entanglement]].\n\nThe delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment investigates a paradox. If a photon manifests itself as though it had come by a single path to the detector, then \"common sense\" (which Wheeler and others challenge) says that it must have entered the double-slit device as a particle. If a photon manifests itself as though it had come by two indistinguishable paths, then it must have entered the double-slit device as a wave. If the experimental apparatus is changed while the photon is in mid\u2011flight, then the photon should reverse its original \"decision\" as to whether to be a wave or a particle. Wheeler pointed out that when these assumptions are applied to a device of interstellar dimensions, a last-minute decision made on Earth on how to observe a photon could alter a decision made millions or even billions of years ago.\n\nWhile delayed-choice experiments have confirmed the seeming ability of measurements made on photons in the present to alter events occurring in the past, this requires a non-standard view of quantum mechanics. If a photon in flight is interpreted as being in a so-called \"superposition of states\", i.e. if it is interpreted as something that has the potentiality to manifest as a particle or wave, but during its time in flight is neither, then there is no time paradox. This is the standard view, and recent experiments have supported it.{{clarify|date=October 2015}}<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Our results demonstrate that the viewpoint that the system photon behaves either definitely as a wave or definitely as a particle would require faster-than-light communication.

If a detection screen (anything from a sheet of white paper to a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) is put on the other side of the double-slit wall (far enough for light from both slits to overlap), a pattern of light and dark fringes will be observed, a pattern that is called an ''interference pattern''.

If one thinks in terms of a stream of photons being randomly directed by such a beam splitter to go down two paths that are kept from interaction, it would seem that no photon can then interfere with any other or with itself.\n\nHowever, if the rate of photon production is reduced so that only one photon is entering the apparatus at any one time, it becomes impossible to understand the photon as only moving through one path, because when the path outputs are redirected so that they coincide on a common detector or detectors, interference phenomena appear. This is similar to envisioning one photon in a two-slit apparatus: even though it is one photon, it still somehow interacts with both slits.\n\n[[Image:Beam Split and fuse.svg|200px|thumb|Figure 1. Experiment that shows delayed determination of photon path]]\n\nIn the two diagrams in Fig. 1, photons are emitted one at a time from a laser symbolized by a yellow star. They pass through a 50% beam splitter (green block) that reflects or transmits 1/2 of the photons.  The reflected or transmitted photons travel along two possible paths depicted by the red or blue lines.\n\nIn the top diagram, it seems as though the trajectories of the photons are known: If a photon emerges from the top of the apparatus, it seems as though it had to have come by way of the blue path, and if it emerges from the side of the apparatus, seem as though it had to have come by way of the red path. However, it is important to keep in mind that the photon is in a superposition of the paths until it is detected. The assumption above\u2014that it 'had to have come by way of' either path\u2014is a form of the 'separation fallacy'.\n\nIn the bottom diagram, a second beam splitter is introduced at the top right.  It recombines the beams corresponding to the red and blue paths. By introducing the second beam splitter, the usual way of thinking is that the path information has been \"erased\"\u2014however we have to be careful, because the photon cannot be assumed to have 'really' gone along one or the other path. Recombining the beams  results in interference phenomena at detection screens positioned just beyond each exit port. What issues to the right side displays reinforcement, and what issues toward the top displays cancellation. It is important to keep in mind however that the illustrated interferometer effects apply only to a single photon in a pure state. When dealing with a pair of entangled photons, the photon encountering the interferometer will be in a mixed state, and there will be no visible interference pattern without coincidence counting to select appropriate subsets of the data.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jacques |first1=Vincent |last2=Wu |first2=E |last3=Grosshans |first3=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last4=Treussart |first4=Fran\u00e7ois |last5=Grangier |first5=Philippe |last6=Aspect |first6=Alain |last7=Rochl |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |year=2007 |title=Experimental Realization of Wheeler's Delayed-Choice Gedanken Experiment |journal=Science |pmid=17303748 |volume=315 |issue=5814 |pages=966\u2013968  |doi=10.1126/science.1136303 |arxiv = quant-ph/0610241 |bibcode = 2007Sci...315..966J }}</ref>\n\n===Delayed choice===\nElementary precursors to current quantum-eraser experiments such as the \"simple quantum eraser\" described above have straightforward classical-wave explanations.

Versions of the quantum eraser using entangled photons, however, are intrinsically non-classical. Because of that, in order to avoid any possible ambiguity concerning the quantum versus classical interpretation, most experimenters have opted to use nonclassical entangled-photon light sources to demonstrate quantum erasers with no classical analog.\n\nFurthermore, use of entangled photons enables the design and implementation of versions of the quantum eraser that are impossible to achieve with single-photon interference, such as the '''delayed-choice quantum eraser''', which is the topic of this article.\n\n==The experiment of Kim ''et al.'' (1999)==\n{{clear}}\n[[Image:Kim EtAl Quantum Eraser.svg|401px|thumb|Figure 2. Setup of the delayed-choice quantum-eraser experiment of Kim ''et al.'' Detector D<sub>0</sub> is movable]]\n\nThe experimental setup, described in detail in Kim ''et al.'',<ref name=\"DCQE\" /> is illustrated in Fig 2. An argon laser generates individual 351.1&nbsp;nm photons that pass through a double-slit apparatus (vertical black line in the upper left corner of the diagram).\n\nAn individual photon goes through one (or both) of the two slits. In the illustration, the photon paths are color-coded as red or light blue lines to indicate which slit the photon came through (red indicates slit A, light blue indicates slit B).\n\nSo far, the experiment is like a conventional two-slit experiment. However, after the slits, [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]] (SPDC) is used to prepare an entangled two-photon state. This is done by a nonlinear optical crystal BBO ([[beta barium borate]]) that converts the photon (from either slit) into two identical, orthogonally polarized [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] photons with 1/2 the frequency of the original photon. The paths followed by these orthogonally polarized photons are caused to diverge by the [[Glan\u2013Thompson prism]].\n\nOne of these 702.2&nbsp;nm photons, referred to as the \"signal\" photon (look at the red and light-blue lines going ''upwards'' from the Glan\u2013Thompson prism) continues to the target detector called ''D''<sub>0</sub>. During an experiment, detector ''D''<sub>0</sub> is scanned along its ''x'' axis, its motions controlled by a step motor. A plot of \"signal\" photon counts detected by ''D''<sub>0</sub> versus ''x'' can be examined to discover whether the cumulative signal forms an interference pattern.\n\nThe other entangled photon, referred to as the \"idler\" photon (look at the red and light-blue lines going ''downwards'' from the Glan\u2013Thompson prism), is deflected by prism ''PS'' that sends it along divergent paths depending on whether it came from slit ''A'' or slit ''B''.\n\nSomewhat beyond the path split, the idler photons encounter [[beam splitter]]s ''BS''<sub>a</sub>, ''BS''<sub>b</sub>, and ''BS''<sub>c</sub> that each have a 50% chance of allowing the idler photon to pass through and a 50% chance of causing it to be reflected. ''M''<sub>a</sub> and ''M''<sub>b</sub> are mirrors.\n\n[[File:KimDelayedChoiceQuantumEraserGraphsSVG.svg|right|thumb|268px|Figure 3. ''x'' axis: position of ''D''<sub>0</sub>.

Note that:\n* If an idler photon is recorded at detector ''D''<sub>3</sub>, it can only have come from slit B.\n* If an idler photon is recorded at detector ''D''<sub>4</sub>, it can only have come from slit A.\n* If an idler photon is detected at detector ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>, it might have come from slit A or slit B.\n* The optical path length measured from slit to ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub>, and ''D''<sub>4</sub> is 2.5&nbsp;m longer than the optical path length from slit to ''D''<sub>0</sub>. This means that any information that one can learn from an idler photon must be approximately 8&nbsp;ns later than what one can learn from its entangled signal photon.\n\nDetection of the idler photon by ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub> provides delayed \"which-path information\" indicating whether the signal photon with which it is entangled had gone through slit A or B. On the other hand, detection of the idler photon by ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub> provides a delayed indication that such information is not available for its entangled signal photon. Insofar as which-path information had earlier potentially been available from the idler photon, it is said that the information has been subjected to a \"delayed erasure\".\n\nBy using a [[coincidence counting (physics)|coincidence counter]], the experimenters were able to isolate the entangled signal from photo-noise, recording only events where both signal and idler photons were detected (after compensating for the 8&nbsp;ns delay). Refer to Figs&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4.\n* When the experimenters looked at the signal photons whose entangled idlers were detected at ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>, they detected interference patterns.\n* However, when they looked at the signal photons whose entangled idlers were detected at ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>, they detected simple diffraction patterns with no interference.\n\n===Significance===\nThis result is similar to that of the double-slit experiment, since interference is observed when it is not known from which slit the photon originates, while no interference is observed when the path is known.\n\n[[File:Detector0RawResults.svg|left|thumb|Figure 5. Distribution of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub> can be compared with distribution of bulbs on [[digital billboard]]. When all the bulbs are lit, billboard does not reveal any pattern of image, which can be \"recovered\" only by switching off some bulbs. Likewise interference pattern or no-interference pattern among signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub> can be recovered only after \"switching off\" (or ignoring) some signal photons and which signal photons should be ignored to recover pattern, this information can be gained only by looking at corresponding entangled idler photons in detectors ''D''<sub>1</sub> to ''D''<sub>4</sub>.]]\n\nHowever, what makes this experiment possibly astonishing is that, unlike in the classic double-slit experiment, the choice of whether to preserve or erase the which-path information of the idler was not made until 8&nbsp;ns ''after'' the position of the signal photon had already been measured by ''D''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nDetection of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub> does not directly yield any which-path information. Detection of idler photons at ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>, which provide which-path information, means that no interference pattern can be observed in the jointly detected subset of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub>. Likewise, detection of idler photons at ''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>, which do not provide which-path information, means that interference patterns ''can'' be observed in the jointly detected subset of signal photons at ''D''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nIn other words, even though an idler photon is not observed until long after its entangled signal photon arrives at ''D''<sub>0</sub> due to the shorter optical path for the latter, interference at ''D''<sub>0</sub> is determined by whether a signal photon's entangled idler photon is detected at a detector that preserves its which-path information (''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>), or at a detector that erases its which-path information (''D''<sub>1</sub> or ''D''<sub>2</sub>).\n\nSome have interpreted this result to mean that the delayed choice to observe or not observe the path of the idler photon changes the outcome of an event in the past.<ref name=Ionicioiu2011>{{cite journal |last=Ionicioiu |first=R. |author2=Terno, D.

One of the most enticing experiments of this kind is the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser designed by Yoon-Ho Kim et. al (2000). It is a rather complicated construction. It is set up to measure correlated pairs of photons, which are in an entangled state, so that one of the two photons is detected 8 nanoseconds before its partner. The results of the experiment are quite amazing. They seem to indicate that the behavior of the photons detected these 8 nanoseconds before their partners is determined by how the partners will be detected. Indeed it might be tempting to interpret these results as an example of the future causing the past. The result is, however, in accordance with the predictions of quantum mechanics.\" http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-backwards/.</ref>  If events at ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub>, ''D''<sub>4</sub> determine outcomes at ''D''<sub>0</sub>, then effect seems to precede cause. If the idler light paths were greatly extended so that a year goes by before a photon shows up at ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub>, or ''D''<sub>4</sub>, then when a photon shows up in one of these detectors, it would cause a signal photon to have shown up in a certain mode a year earlier. Alternatively, knowledge of the future fate of the idler photon would determine the activity of the signal photon in its own present. Neither of these ideas conforms to the usual human expectation of causality. However, knowledge of the future, which would be a hidden variable, was refuted in experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A quantum delayed choice experiment |journal=Science |volume=338 |issue=6107 |pages=634\u2013637 |arxiv=1205.4926 |last1=Peruzzo |first1=Alberto |last2= Shadbolt |first2=Peter J. |last3=Brunner |first3=Nicolas |last4=Popescu |first4=Sandu |last5= O'Brien |first5=Jeremy L. |year=2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1226719 |pmid=23118183 |bibcode=2012Sci...338..634P}}</ref>\n\nExperiments that involve [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] exhibit phenomena that may make some people doubt their ordinary ideas about causal sequence. In the delayed-choice quantum eraser, an interference pattern will form on ''D''<sub>0</sub> even if which-path data pertinent to photons that form it are only erased later in time than the signal photons that hit the primary detector. Not only that feature of the experiment is puzzling; ''D''<sub>0</sub> can, in principle at least, be on one side of the universe, and the other four detectors can be \"on the other side of the universe\" to each other.<ref name=Greene2004>{{cite book |last=Greene |first=Brian |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos |url=https://archive.org/details/fabricofcosmossp00gree |url-access=registration |year=2004 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |isbn=978-0-375-41288-2}}</ref>{{rp|197f}}\n\n=== Consensus: no retrocausality ===\nHowever, the interference pattern can only be seen retroactively once the idler photons have been detected and the experimenter has had information about them available, with the interference pattern being seen when the experimenter looks at particular ''subsets'' of signal photons that were matched with idlers that went to particular detectors.<ref name=Greene2004/>{{rp|197}}\n\nMoreover, the apparent retroactive action vanishes if the effects of observations on the state of the [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] signal and idler photons are considered in their historical order. Specifically, in the case when detection/deletion of which-way information happens ''before'' the detection on ''D''<sub>0</sub>, the standard simplistic explanation says \"The detector ''D''<sub>i</sub>, at which the idler photon is detected, determines the probability distribution at ''D''<sub>0</sub> for the signal photon\". Similarly, in the case when ''D''<sub>0</sub> ''precedes'' detection of the idler photon, the following description is just as accurate: \"The position at ''D''<sub>0</sub> of the detected signal photon determines the probabilities for the idler photon to hit either of ''D''<sub>1</sub>, ''D''<sub>2</sub>, ''D''<sub>3</sub> or ''D''<sub>4</sub>\". These are just equivalent ways of formulating the correlations of entangled photons' observables in an intuitive causal way, so one may choose any of those (in particular, that one where the cause precedes the consequence and no retrograde action appears in the explanation).\n\nThe total pattern of signal photons at the primary detector never shows interference (see Fig. 5), so ''it is not possible to deduce what will happen to the idler photons by observing the signal photons alone''. The delayed-choice quantum eraser does not communicate information in a retro-causal manner because it takes another signal, one which must arrive by a process that can go no faster than the speed of light, to sort the superimposed data in the signal photons into four streams that reflect the states of the idler photons at their four distinct detection screens.<ref group=note>\"...&nbsp;the future measurements do not in any way change the data you collected today. But the future measurements ''do'' influence the kinds of details you can invoke when you subsequently describe what happened today. Before you have the results of the idler photon measurements, you really can't say anything at all about the which-path history of any given signal photon. However, once you have the results, you conclude that signal photons whose idler partners were successfully used to ascertain which-path information ''can'' be described as having&nbsp;... traveled either left or right. You also conclude that signal photons whose idler partners had their which-path information erased ''cannot'' be described as having&nbsp;... definitely gone one way or the other (a conclusion you can convincingly confirm by using the newly acquired idler photon data to expose the previously hidden interference pattern among this latter class of signal photons).

So that D<sub>0</sub> will be triggered much earlier by photon 1. After the registration of photon 1, we look at these \"delayed\" detection events of D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, and D<sub>4</sub> which have constant time delays, i \u2243 (Li \u2212 L0)/c, relative to the triggering time of D<sub>0</sub>.\n\n'''P.2:'''   In this experiment the optical delay (Li \u2212 L0) is chosen to be \u2243 2.5m, where L0 is the optical distance between the output surface of BBO and detector D<sub>0</sub>, and Li is the optical distance between the output surface of the BBO and detectors D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, and D<sub>4</sub>, respectively. This means that any information one can learn from photon 2 must be at least 8ns later than what one has learned from the registration of photon 1.

{"title_page": "Standpoint theory", "text_new": "{{For|the ideology arguing that feminist social science should be practiced from the standpoint of women|Standpoint feminism}}\n\n{{technical|date=October 2018}}\n'''Standpoint theory''' is a theory found in some academic disciplines which is used for analyzing [[inter-subjective]] [[discourse]]s. This body of work proposes that authority is rooted in individuals' knowledge (their [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s), and the power that such authority exerts.\n\nStandpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her social and political experiences. Standpoints are argued to be multifaceted rather than essentializing: for example, while Hispanic women may generally share some perspectives, particularly with regard to ethnicity or sex, they are not defined solely by these viewpoints despite some common features there is no essentially Hispanic female identity. Group experiences create a general and permanent perspective of an immense situation but without personal experiences one\u2019s standpoint cannot become truly comprehensible. The amalgamation of a person's many experienced dimensions form a standpoint\u2014a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]\u2014through which that individual sees and understands the world.\n\nStandpoint theorists emphasize the utility of a naturalistic''',''' or everyday experiential, concept of knowing (i.e., [[epistemology]]).  One's standpoint (whether reflexively considered or not)  shapes which concepts are intelligible, which claims are heard and understood by whom, which features of the world are perceptually salient, which reasons are understood to be relevant and forceful, and which conclusions credible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sprague|first=Joey|title=The standpoint of art/criticism|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=13&sid=e26ca1ca-8c19-4976-ad8a-7d7af38f55a0%40sessionmgr15&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=66905263}}</ref>\n\nStandpoint theory supports what feminist theorist [[Sandra Harding]] calls [[strong objectivity]], or the notion that the perspectives of [[marginalized]] and/or oppressed individuals can help to create more objective accounts of the world. Through the outsider-within phenomenon, these individuals are placed in a unique position to point to patterns of behavior that those immersed in the dominant group culture are unable to recognize.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Brenda J.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory: a Black Woman's Review of Organizational Socialization|journal=Communication Studies|year=1996|volume=47|issue=4|pages=257\u2013271|doi=10.1080/10510979609368482}}</ref> Standpoint theory gives voice to the marginalized groups by allowing them to challenge the status quo as the outsider within.

The views of those who belong to groups with more social power are validated more than those in marginalized groups. Those in marginalized groups must learn to be [[bicultural]], or to \"pass\" in the [[dominant culture]] to survive, even though that perspective is not their own.<ref name=\"DeFranciscoVictoria\">DeFrancisco, Victoria P. ''Communicating Gender Diversity: A Critical Approach''. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, INC., 2007.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe original inspirations for standpoint theory can be seen in the works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], a [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher, who studied the different standpoints between slaves and masters in 1807.<ref>Wood, J.T. (2008). Critical feminist theories. In L.A. Baxter & D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 323-334). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref> He claimed that the master-slave relationship is about people's belonging positions, and the groups affect how people receive knowledge and power.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at COMMUNICATION THEORY: Standpoint Theory|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|pages=441\u2013453}}</ref> Essential Work on the relation between social Standpoints and Knowledge, i.e. worldview has been put forward by one of the founders of sociology of Knowledge [[Karl Mannheim]], which is often overlooked. The concept has long been discussed in [[Sociology of knowledge|Sociology of Knowledge]], also in confrontation with [[Critical Theory]] in the [[Frankfurt School]] where it was considered relativistic (Mannheim vs. Horkheimer). Newer developments in Feminist studies have a similar point, but focusing on some aspects,e.g. Nancy Hartsock examined standpoint theory by using relations between men and women. She published \"The Feminist Standpoint: Developing Ground for a Specifically Feminist Historical Materialism\" in 1983. Hartsock used Hegel's ideas of masters and slaves and Marx's ideas of class and [[capitalism]] as an inspiration to look into matters of sex and gender.\n\nContemporary standpoint theory often focuses on the social positions such as gender, [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], class, [[culture]], and economic status.<ref>Wallance, R. A., and A. Wolf (1995). ''Contemporary Sociological Theory: Continuing the classical tradition''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.</ref> Standpoint theory seeks to develop a particular [[feminist epistemology]], that values the experiences of women and minorities as a source for knowledge.<ref>McCann and Kim, ''Feminist Theory Reader: Local and global perspectives'', 2003.</ref>.\n\nProminent standpoint theorists include [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Nancy Hartsock]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sandra Harding]], [[Alison Wylie]], Lynette Hunter and [[Patricia Hill Collins]].\n\n==Key concepts==\nGenerally, standpoint theory gives insight into specific circumstances only available to the members of a certain collective standpoint. According to Michael Ryan, \"the idea of a collective standpoint does not imply an essential overarching characteristic but rather a sense of belonging to a group bounded by a shared experience.\"<ref>''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'', 789.</ref> Kristina Rolin states that \"the assumption of essentialism is that all women share the same socially grounded perspective in virtue of being women, the assumption of automatic epistemic privilege is that [[epistemic advantage]] accrues to the subordinate automatically, just in virtue of their occupying a particular social position.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolin|first=Kristina|date=2009|title=Standpoint Theory as a Methodology for the Study of Power Relations|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=4|pages=218\u2013226|jstor=20618192|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01070.x}}</ref> According to this approach:\n* A standpoint is a place from which [[human beings]] view the [[world]].\n* A standpoint influences how the people adopting it [[social construct|socially construct]] the world.\n* A standpoint is a mental position from which things are viewed.\n* A standpoint is a position from which objects or principles are viewed and according to which they are compared and judged.\n* The inequalities of different social groups create differences in their standpoints.\n* All standpoints are partial; so (for example) [[Standpoint feminism]] coexists with other standpoints.\n\n==Applications==\n\nSince standpoint theory focuses on marginalized populations, it is often applied within fields that focus on these populations. Standpoint has been referenced as a concept that should be acknowledged and understood in the [[Social Work]] field, especially when approaching and assisting clients.<ref>Swigonski, M. E. (1993). \"Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Questions of Social Work Research\". ''Affilia'', 8(2), 171\u2013183.</ref> Many marginalized populations rely on the welfare system to survive.  Unfortunately, those who structure the welfare system typically have never needed to utilize its services before. Standpoint theory has been presented as a method to improving the [[welfare]] system by recognizing suggestions made by those within the welfare system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Edmonds-Cady | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = Getting to the grassroots: Feminist standpoints within the welfare movement | url = | journal = Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 11\u201333 }}</ref> In Africa, standpoint theory has catalyzed a social movement where women are introduced to the radio in order to promote awareness of their experiences and hardships and to help these women heal and find closure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gatua | first1 = M.

If there were any power relationships there could never be a single perspective. No viewpoint could ever be complete, and there is no limit to anyone's perspective.\n\nAsante and Davis\u2019s (1989) study of interracial encounters in the workplace found that because of different cultural perspectives, approaching organizational interactions with others with different beliefs, assumptions, and meanings often leads to miscommunication. Brenda Allen stated in her research that, \"Organizational members' experiences, attitudes, and behaviors in the workplace are often influenced by race-ethnicity.\"<ref>Allen, B. J. (1995). \"'Diversity' and organizational communication\". ''Journal of Applied Communication Research'', 23, 145.</ref>\n\nPaul Adler and John Jermier suggest that management scholars should be aware of their standpoints. They write that those studying management should \"consciously choose [their] standpoints and take responsibility for the impact (or lack of impact) of [their] scholarship on the world.\"<ref>Adler, Paul, and John Jermier. 2005. \"Developing a field with more soul: Standpoint theory and public policy research for management scholars\". ''The Academy of Management Journal'' 48 (6): 942.</ref>\n\nJermier argued that all parts of a research study- identifying the problem, theorizing research questions, gathering and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and the knowledge produced are there to some extent because of the researcher\u2019s standpoint. This caused him to question what standpoint to adopt in the management of scientists. To avoid falling into limitations of the status quo and certain standpoints, he said that \"the view from below has greater potential to generate more complete and more objective knowledge claims.\" He continues to say that, \u201cif our desire is to heal the world, we will learn more about how the root mechanisms of the world work and about how things can be changed by adopting the standpoints of those people and other parts of nature that most deeply suffer its wounds.\u201d<ref>Jermier, J.M. 1998. \"Critical perspectives on organizational control\".

(2) Marginalized groups are socially situated in ways that make it more possible for them to be aware of things and ask questions than it is for the non-marginalized.  (3) Research, particularly that focused on power relations, should begin with the lives of the marginalized.<ref name=Bowell>{{cite web|last1=Bowell|first1=T.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> \n \nFeminist standpoint theorists such as Dorothy Smith, Patricia Hill Collins, Nancy Hartsock, and Sandra Harding claimed that certain socio-political positions occupied by women (and by extension other groups who lack social and economic privilege) can become sites of epistemic privilege and thus productive starting points for inquiry into questions about not only those who are socially and politically marginalized, but also those who, by dint of social and political privilege, occupy the positions of oppressors. This claim was specifically generated by Sandra Harding and as such, \"Starting off research from women's lives will generate less partial and distorted accounts not only of women's lives but also of men's lives and of the whole social order.\"<ref name=\"Griffin_b\">Griffin, E. M. (2009). ''A first look at communication theory'' (7th edn). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> This practice is also quite evident when women enter into professions that are considered to be male oriented. [[Londa Schiebinger]] states, \"While women now study at prestigious universities at about the same rate as men, they are rarely invited to join the faculty at top universities...The sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]] has observed that 'the more prestigious the institution, the longer women wait to be promoted.' Men, generally speaking, face no such trade-off.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|pages=33\u201353}}</ref>\n\nStandpoint feminists have been concerned with these dualisms for two related reasons. First, dualisms usually imply a hierarchical relationship between the terms, elevating one and devaluing the other.<ref name=WestTurner>West, R., and H. L. Turner (2004). ''Communication Theory. Analysis and Application''.</ref> He also said that when we suggest that decisions should be made rationally, not emotionally, for example, we are showing that reason holds a higher value in our culture than does emotion. Also, related to this issue is the concern that these dualisms often become gendered in our culture. In this process, men are associated with one extreme and women with the other. In the case of reason and emotion, women are identified with emotion. Because our culture values emotion less than reason, women suffer from this association.

Generalizations across the entire female gender can be broken into smaller more specific groups pertaining to women's different social classes and cultures, but are still generalized as distinct groups, and thus marginalization still occurs. West and Turner stated that an author by the name of Catherine O'Leary (1997) argued that although standpoint theory has been helpful in reclaiming women's experiences as suitable research topics, it contains a problematic emphasis on the universality of this experience, at the expense of differences among women's experiences.<ref name=WestTurner />\n\nAnother main criticism of Harding and Wood's standpoint theory is the credibility of strong objectivity vs. subjectivity. Standpoint theorists argue that standpoints are relative and cannot be evaluated by any absolute criteria, but make the assumption that the oppressed are less biased or more impartial than the privileged.<ref name=\"Griffin_b\" /> This leaves open the possibility of an overbalance of power, in which the oppressed group intentionally or unintentionally becomes the oppressor. Intentional overbalance of power, or revenge, can manifest as justification for extremism and militarism, which can sometimes be seen in more extreme forms of feminism.\n\nWhile the beginnings of standpoint theory are based on the critical paradigm from a Marxist view of social class oppression, a feminist philosophy developed in the 1970s and 1980s and the main focus has been on the feministic side. Other groups, as of now, need to be included into the theory and a new emphasis needs to be made toward other marginalized or muted groups. These groups envelop minorities, culturally different and the disabled or those that have a disability. When Harding and Wood conceived Standpoint theory they did not understand, when they defined it as a feminist view, that there are different cultures existing in the same social group. Many researchers are unsure of the idea of it having essentialism, as essentialism refers to the practice of generalizing all groups as though they were, in essence, the same.\u201d Early standpoint theorists sought to understand the way in which the gendered identity of knowers affected their epistemic resources and capacities\u201d<ref name=\"Wylie\" />{{rp|48}}. These other muted or marginalized groups have a more realistic approach to standpoint theory as they have different experiences than those that are in power and even within those muted groups differences defined by different cultures of people can have an altered standpoint. This view gives a basis that in part Standpoint Theory has a central principle of the inversion thesis and Joshua St. Pierre defined this as \"the inversion thesis gives epistemic authority to those marginalized by systems of oppression insofar as these people are often better knowers than those who benefit from oppression. Put simply: social dispossession produces epistemic privilege.\"\n\nPart of standpoint theory\u2019s return to favor comes from a re-articulation of its methodology, aims, and limitations that directly answer the criticisms mentioned above.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWylie has perhaps provided the most succinct articulation of second-wave standpoint theory. For her, a standpoint does not mark out a clearly defined territory such as \u201cwomen\u201d within which members have automatic privilege but is a rather a posture of epistemic engagement. Responding to the claim that the situated knowledge thesis reifies essentialism, Wylie thus argues that it is \"an open (empirical) question whether such structures obtain in a given context, what form they take, and how they are internalized or embodied by individuals\".<ref name=\"Wylie\" />{{rp|62}} Identities are complex and cannot be reduced to simple binaries. Likewise, she argues that the criticism of automatic privilege is falters insofar as a standpoint is never given, but is achieved.

This body of work proposes that authority is rooted in individuals' knowledge (their [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s), and the power that such authority exerts.\n\nStandpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her social and political experiences. Standpoints are argued to be multifaceted rather than essentializing: for example, while Hispanic women may generally share some perspectives, particularly with regard to ethnicity or sex, they are not defined solely by these viewpoints despite some common features there is no essentially Hispanic female identity. Group experiences create a general and permanent perspective of an immense situation but without personal experiences one\u2019s standpoint cannot become truly comprehensible. The amalgamation of a person's many experienced dimensions form a standpoint\u2014a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]\u2014through which that individual sees and understands the world.\n\nStandpoint theorists emphasize the utility of a naturalistic''',''' or everyday experiential, concept of knowing (i.e., [[epistemology]]).  One's standpoint (whether reflexively considered or not)  shapes which concepts are intelligible, which claims are heard and understood by whom, which features of the world are perceptually salient, which reasons are understood to be relevant and forceful, and which conclusions credible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sprague|first=Joey|title=The standpoint of art/criticism|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=13&sid=e26ca1ca-8c19-4976-ad8a-7d7af38f55a0%40sessionmgr15&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=66905263}}</ref>\n\nStandpoint theory supports what feminist theorist [[Sandra Harding]] calls [[strong objectivity]], or the notion that the perspectives of [[marginalized]] and/or oppressed individuals can help to create more objective accounts of the world.

The concept has long been discussed in [[Sociology of Knowledge]], also in confrontation with [[Critical Theory]] in the [[Frankfurt School]] where it was considered relativistic (Mannheim vs. Horkheimer). Newer developments in Feminist studies have a similar point, but focusing on some aspects,e.g. Nancy Hartsock examined standpoint theory by using relations between men and women. She published \"The Feminist Standpoint: Developing Ground for a Specifically Feminist Historical Materialism\" in 1983. Hartsock used Hegel's ideas of masters and slaves and Marx's ideas of class and [[capitalism]] as an inspiration to look into matters of sex and gender.\n\nContemporary standpoint theory often focuses on the social positions such as gender, [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], class, [[culture]], and economic status.<ref>Wallance, R. A., and A. Wolf (1995). ''Contemporary Sociological Theory: Continuing the classical tradition''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.</ref> Standpoint theory seeks to develop a particular [[feminist epistemology]], that values the experiences of women and minorities as a source for knowledge.<ref>McCann and Kim, ''Feminist Theory Reader: Local and global perspectives'', 2003.</ref>.\n\nProminent standpoint theorists include [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Nancy Hartsock]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sandra Harding]], [[Alison Wylie]], Lynette Hunter and [[Patricia Hill Collins]].\n\n==Key concepts==\nGenerally, standpoint theory gives insight into specific circumstances only available to the members of a certain collective standpoint. According to Michael Ryan, \"the idea of a collective standpoint does not imply an essential overarching characteristic but rather a sense of belonging to a group bounded by a shared experience.\"<ref>''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'', 789.</ref> Kristina Rolin states that \"the assumption of essentialism is that all women share the same socially grounded perspective in virtue of being women, the assumption of automatic epistemic privilege is that [[epistemic advantage]] accrues to the subordinate automatically, just in virtue of their occupying a particular social position.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolin|first=Kristina|date=2009|title=Standpoint Theory as a Methodology for the Study of Power Relations|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=4|pages=218\u2013226|jstor=20618192|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01070.x}}</ref> According to this approach:\n* A standpoint is a place from which [[human beings]] view the [[world]].\n* A standpoint influences how the people adopting it [[social construct|socially construct]] the world.\n* A standpoint is a mental position from which things are viewed.\n* A standpoint is a position from which objects or principles are viewed and according to which they are compared and judged.\n* The inequalities of different social groups create differences in their standpoints.\n* All standpoints are partial; so (for example) [[Standpoint feminism]] coexists with other standpoints.\n\n==Applications==\n\nSince standpoint theory focuses on marginalized populations, it is often applied within fields that focus on these populations. Standpoint has been referenced as a concept that should be acknowledged and understood in the [[Social Work]] field, especially when approaching and assisting clients.<ref>Swigonski, M. E.

These other muted or marginalized groups have a more realistic approach to standpoint theory as they have different experiences than those that are in power and even within those muted groups differences defined by different cultures of people can have an altered standpoint. This view gives a basis that in part Standpoint Theory has a central principle of the inversion thesis and Joshua St. Pierre defined this as \"the inversion thesis gives epistemic authority to those marginalized by systems of oppression insofar as these people are often better knowers than those who benefit from oppression. Put simply: social dispossession produces epistemic privilege.\"\n\nPart of standpoint theory\u2019s return to favor comes from a re-articulation of its methodology, aims, and limitations that directly answer the criticisms mentioned above.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWylie has perhaps provided the most succinct articulation of second-wave standpoint theory. For her, a standpoint does not mark out a clearly defined territory such as \u201cwomen\u201d within which members have automatic privilege but is a rather a posture of epistemic engagement. Responding to the claim that the situated knowledge thesis reifies essentialism, Wylie thus argues that it is \"an open (empirical) question whether such structures obtain in a given context, what form they take, and how they are internalized or embodied by individuals\".<ref name=\"Wylie\" />{{rp|62}} Identities are complex and cannot be reduced to simple binaries. Likewise, she argues that the criticism of automatic privilege is falters insofar as a standpoint is never given, but is achieved.
