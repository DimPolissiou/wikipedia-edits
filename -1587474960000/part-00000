Except for a small stretch of land to the west of [[Kanyakumari]] town, almost the entire district is sandwiched between the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] - the only district in [[Tamilnadu]] state facing the [[Arabian Sea]].\n\nGeologically, the landmass of the district is much younger when compared to the rest of the state - faulted as late as 2.5 million years during the [[Miocene]], after which numerous [[Marine transgression|transgression]], as well as regression of sea, had shaped the western coast of the district.\n\nHistorically, [[Nanjinad]] and [[Edai Nadu]] which comprise the present day Kanyakumari district, was ruled by various Tamil and Malayalam dynasties: the [[Venad|Venad Kingdom]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyans]], the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Ay kingdom|Ays]] and the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]]. A few artifacts unearthed by archeological excavations in there. It was part of the princely state of [[Travancore]] during the colonial times prior to [[Independence Day (India)|India's independence]]; four of the eight [[tehsil]]s of [[Thiruvananthapuram district]] were separated from erstwhile Travancore Kingdom to form the new district of Kanyakumari, and they were made the part of [[Madras Presidency]] under recommendations from the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.\n\nMany historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate sages such as [[Vyasa]], [[Agastya]], [[Tolk\u0101ppiyam|Tolkappiyar]], [[Avvaiyar]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]] to the district. The district is also the birthplace of [[Ayyavazhi]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Ay kingdom|Venad|Sangam period|Travancore|Chera dynasty}}\n{{see also|Merger of Kanyakumari with Madras State}}\n\nThe area that comprises the current Kanyakumari district was a part of the old Ay kingdom of the first and second Sangham ages. Following the decline of the Ay kingdoms, the area became Venad, with its capital [[Padmanabhapuram]] located North, North West of Nagercoil. The wealth of the Nanjilnadu beckoned many invaded kings including the Nayaks and later an Islamist army during the reign of [[Umayamma Rani]]. The [[Venad]] region was in anarchy before [[Marthanda Varma]] ascended the throne in 1729 AD. Under their rule anarchy was dominant in [[Kanyakumari]] region. However, [[Marthanda Varma]] brought a sense of disorder under control by annexing the nearby territories, putting down the feudal lords and establishing the strong state of [[Travancore]]. He had also bought some portions of Kanyakumari from the then viceroy making it the southern boundary. Under his rule, the district improved in a social context as well as economically. The famous [[battle of Colachel]] took place in the district. Later, the Maharajas of Travancore built the forts at Aramboly ( Aralvaimozhy) to prevent any invasion from the Carnatic Kings. Key elements of [[Velu Thampi Dalawa|Velu Thampi Dalawa's]] revolt occurred in the area and the English East India company's army under Col. Leger broke through the fortifications and entered Travancore in 1810. In the year 1949, the area became a part of the reestablished [[Travancore]] Cochin state. The people of Agasteeswarem, Thovalai, Kalkulam and Vilavancode taluks, which formed the southern divisions of the former district of [[Trivandrum]], were predominantly Tamil speaking people. An extreme agitation by Tamil speaking residents under the leadership of [[A. Nesamony|Marshal Nesamony]] took place for including Kanyakumari within [[Tamil Nadu]]. Eventually the merger happened in 1956 based on [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|language reorganization of states]].\n\nHistorically, [[Nanjilnadu]] (Agastheeswaram and Thovalai taluks) and [[Eda Nadu]] (Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks) which comprises the present Kanyakumari district. The district were ruled by various dynasties: [[Venad|Venad Kingdom]], [[Travancore|Travancore Kingdom]], the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Ay kingdom|Ays]] and the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]]. A few artifacts were unearthed by archeological excavations in parts of the district. The district was part of the princely state of [[Travancore]] during the colonial times prior to [[Independence Day (India)|India's independence]]; four of the eight [[tehsil]]s of [[Thiruvananthapuram district]] were separated to form the new district of Kanyakumari in 1956 following the demands of reunion made by the Tamil speaking majority people (about 70% of the population), who feels that their feelings were suppressed by the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom which has Malayalam majority population. The four taluks were made the part of then [[Madras Presidency]] under recommendations from the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969 and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.\n\nThe district is the birthplace of [[Ayyavazhi]], the [[Henotheism|henotheistic]] belief initiated by [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan Seedar]], one among the 5 prime disciples of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]. The social, religious and cultural history of the 19th century Kanyakumari district is intrinsically inter-twined with those of Ayyavazhi. Many historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate with sages namely [[Vyasa]], [[Agastya]], [[Tolk\u0101ppiyam|Tolkappiyar]], [[Avvaiyar]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]].\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Location ===\nThe district is situated between 77\u00b015' and 77\u00b036' east longitude and 8\u00b003' and 8\u00b035' north latitude.

Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks are in the Edai nadu region which consists of full stretched Western ghats. Thovalai and Agastheeswaram taluks are present in the Nanjil nadu region. Aralvaimozhy pass separates these two regions. Also the boundary of these regions is Vaezhimalai ( Vaezhi Hills).\n\nKanyakumari district has a varied topography with sea on three sides and the mountains of the [[Western Ghats]] bordering the northern side.

The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.\n\nMany historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate sages such as [[Vyasa]], [[Agastya]], [[Tolk\u0101ppiyam|Tolkappiyar]], [[Avvaiyar]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]] to the district. The district is also the birthplace of [[Ayyavazhi]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Ay kingdom|Venad|Sangam period|Travancore|Chera dynasty}}\n{{see also|Merger of Kanyakumari with Madras State}}\n\nThe area that comprises the current Kanyakumari district was a part of the old Ay kingdom of the first and second Sangham ages. Following the decline of the Ay kingdoms, the area became Venad, with its capital [[Padmanabhapuram]] located North, North West of Nagercoil. The wealth of the Nanjilnadu beckoned many invaded kings including the Nayaks and later an Islamist army during the reign of [[Umayamma Rani]]. The [[Venad]] region was in anarchy before [[Marthanda Varma]] ascended the throne in 1729 AD. Under their rule anarchy was dominant in [[Kanyakumari]] region. However, [[Marthanda Varma]] brought a sense of disorder under control by annexing the nearby territories, putting down the feudal lords and establishing the strong state of [[Travancore]]. He had also bought some portions of Kanyakumari from the then viceroy making it the southern boundary. Under his rule, the district improved in a social context as well as economically. The famous [[battle of Colachel]] took place in the district. Later, the Maharajas of Travancore built the forts at Aramboly ( Aralvaimozhy) to prevent any invasion from the Carnatic Kings. Key elements of [[Velu Thampi Dalawa|Velu Thampi Dalawa's]] revolt occurred in the area and the English East India company's army under Col. Leger broke through the fortifications and entered Travancore in 1810. In the year 1949, the area became a part of the reestablished [[Travancore]] Cochin state. The people of Agasteeswarem, Thovalai, Kalkulam and Vilavancode taluks, which formed the southern divisions of the former district of [[Trivandrum]], were predominantly Tamil speaking people. An extreme agitation by Tamil speaking residents under the leadership of [[A. Nesamony|Marshal Nesamony]] took place for including Kanyakumari within [[Tamil Nadu]]. Eventually the merger happened in 1956 based on [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|language reorganization of states]].\n\nHistorically, [[Nanjilnadu]] (Agastheeswaram and Thovalai taluks) and [[Eda Nadu]] (Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks) which comprises the present Kanyakumari district. The district were ruled by various dynasties: [[Venad|Venad Kingdom]], [[Travancore|Travancore Kingdom]], the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Ay kingdom|Ays]] and the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]]. A few artifacts were unearthed by archeological excavations in parts of the district. The district was part of the princely state of [[Travancore]] during the colonial times prior to [[Independence Day (India)|India's independence]]; four of the eight [[tehsil]]s of [[Thiruvananthapuram district]] were separated to form the new district of Kanyakumari in 1956 following the demands of reunion made by the Tamil speaking majority people (about 70% of the population), who feels that their feelings were suppressed by the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom which has Malayalam majority population. The four taluks were made the part of then [[Madras Presidency]] under recommendations from the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969 and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.\n\nThe district is the birthplace of [[Ayyavazhi]], the [[Henotheism|henotheistic]] belief initiated by [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan Seedar]], one among the 5 prime disciples of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]. The social, religious and cultural history of the 19th century Kanyakumari district is intrinsically inter-twined with those of Ayyavazhi. Many historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate with sages namely [[Vyasa]], [[Agastya]], [[Tolk\u0101ppiyam|Tolkappiyar]], [[Avvaiyar]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]].\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Location ===\nThe district is situated between 77\u00b015' and 77\u00b036' east longitude and 8\u00b003' and 8\u00b035' north latitude.

Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining [[Adilshahi sultanate]] of [[Bijapur]] that formed the genesis of the [[Maratha Empire]]. In 1674, he was formally crowned as the ''[[chhatrapati]]'' (emperor) of his realm at [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].\n\nOver the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Sultanate of Golkonda]] and [[Sultanate of Bijapur]], as well as European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Sanskrit]], rather than [[Persian language]], in court and administration.\n\nShivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the [[Indian independence movement]], as many elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.{{sfn|Wolpert|1962|p=81}} Particularly in [[Maharashtra]], debates over his history and role have engendered great passion and sometimes even violence as disparate groups have sought to characterise him and his legacy.<!-- DOES NOT NEED CITE SINCE ITS A SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVE POINTS FROM HISTORIOGRAPHY SECTION -->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n\n==Early life==\n{{main|Early life of Shivaji}}\nShivaji was born in the hill-fort of [[Shivneri]], near the city of [[Junnar]] in what is now [[Pune district]].

Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining [[Adilshahi sultanate]] of [[Bijapur]] that formed the genesis of the [[Maratha Empire]]. In 1674, he was formally crowned as the ''[[chhatrapati]]'' (emperor) of his realm at [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].\n\nOver the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Sultanate of Golkonda]] and [[Sultanate of Bijapur]], as well as European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Sanskrit]], rather than [[Persian language]], in court and administration.\n\nShivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the [[Indian independence movement]], as many elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.{{sfn|Wolpert|1962|p=81}} Particularly in [[Maharashtra]], debates over his history and role have engendered great passion and sometimes even violence as disparate groups have sought to characterise him and his legacy.<!-- DOES NOT NEED CITE SINCE ITS A SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVE POINTS FROM HISTORIOGRAPHY SECTION -->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Ancestors ==\nShivaji was born in family of [[Bhonsle]], a [[Maratha]] clan.

The line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet. The station was located at the foot of the line's most striking feature - a three quarters of a mile, [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] at a [[slope|gradient]] of 1 in 4 (25%).\n\nThe line's seven stations were designed by Rice Hopkins.{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=100-104 & 377}} Comberow was one of the five which showed a clear family resemblance. It offered the usual goods and passenger facilities. Although the station nameboard and all published literature refers to the station as \"Comberow\", passenger tickets were printed \"Combe Row\".{{sfn|Sellick|1981|loc=Rear cover}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=400}}\n\nComberow's situation in a valley at the foot of the incline, together with the happy accidents of having an early railway photographer in the vicinity and exceptional historians interested in the railway has left a rich legacy of photographs of the station in context.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=16, 32 & 64}}{{sfn|Sellick|1981|pp=19-41}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=108-110, 216-257, 308-313}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westsomersetmineralrailway.org.uk/search-results/?cx=008280462965567282035%3Abykwl9bejjo&cof=FORID%3A10&ie=UTF-8&q=comberow&sa=Search&siteurl=www.westsomersetmineralrailway.org.uk%2F&ref=&ss=3872j2456456j8 |title=Comberow Station and surrounds |website=West Somerset Mineral Railway Project}}</ref>\n\n==Services==\nThe stone-built station opened for goods traffic in 1857. A passenger service began in September 1865, connecting Watchet with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried from Comberow up the rope-hauled incline to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|pp=6, 24 & 26}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=263-7 & 286-7}}\n\nThe initial passenger service consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], their fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two mixed trains a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line,{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=43}} reopening Colton mine and starting a new bore at Timwood, a few hundred yards north of Comberow. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907{{sfn|Scott-Morgan|1980|p=10}} no passenger service was provided. The venture collapsed in March 1910.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|p=76}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=327}}\n\n==Abandonment==\nAfter closure in 1910 the line through Comberow was subject to minimal maintenance{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=339-340, 349 & 360}} until its metals were requisitioned for the war effort in 1917.\n\nWith neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925, after which the station building slowly decayed.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}\n\nEvocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=66-67 & 76-77}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nBy 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images. The [[West Somerset Mineral Railway#Comberow incline|incline from Comberow to Brendon Hill]] is a [[Listed building|Listed structure]]. The stationmaster's house survives, but has been greatly altered.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=372}}\n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{Rail line\n|previous={{rws|Roadwater}}<br /><small>Line and station

to carry [[iron ore]] from [[Mining on the Brendon Hills|mines]] to [[Watchet harbour]] in [[Somerset]], England. The line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet. The station was located at the foot of the line's most striking feature - a three quarters of a mile, [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] at a [[slope|gradient]] of 1 in 4 (25%).\n\nThe line's seven stations were designed by Rice Hopkins.{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=100-104 & 377}} Comberow was one of the five which showed a clear family resemblance. It offered the usual goods and passenger facilities. Although the station nameboard and all published literature refers to the station as \"Comberow\", passenger tickets were printed \"Combe Row\".{{sfn|Sellick|1981|loc=Rear cover}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=400}}\n\nComberow's situation in a valley at the foot of the incline, together with the happy accidents of having an early railway photographer in the vicinity and exceptional historians interested in the railway has left a rich legacy of photographs of the station in context.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=16, 32 & 64}}{{sfn|Sellick|1981|pp=19-41}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=108-110, 216-257, 308-313}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westsomersetmineralrailway.org.uk/search-results/?cx=008280462965567282035%3Abykwl9bejjo&cof=FORID%3A10&ie=UTF-8&q=comberow&sa=Search&siteurl=www.westsomersetmineralrailway.org.uk%2F&ref=&ss=3872j2456456j8 |title=Comberow Station and surrounds |website=West Somerset Mineral Railway Project}}</ref>\n\n==Services==\nThe stone-built station opened for goods traffic in 1857. A passenger service began in September 1865, connecting Watchet with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried from Comberow up the rope-hauled incline to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|pp=6, 24 & 26}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=263-7 & 286-7}}\n\nThe initial passenger service consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], their fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two mixed trains a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line,{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=43}} reopening Colton mine and starting a new bore at Timwood, a few hundred yards north of Comberow. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907{{sfn|Scott-Morgan|1980|p=10}} no passenger service was provided. The venture collapsed in March 1910.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|p=76}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=327}}\n\n==Abandonment==\nAfter closure in 1910 the line through Comberow was subject to minimal maintenance{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=339-340, 349 & 360}} until its metals were requisitioned for the war effort in 1917.\n\nWith neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925, after which the station building slowly decayed.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}\n\nEvocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp.66-67 & 76-77}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nBy 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images.

As a young man he worked as a shepherd and farmhand, and was largely self-educated through reading. He was a friend of many of the great writers of his day, including [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], of whom he later wrote an [[unauthorized biography]]. He became widely known as the \"'''Ettrick Shepherd'''\", a nickname under which some of his works were published, and the character name he was given in the widely read series ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'', published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. He is best known today for his novel ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]''. His other works include the long poem ''[[The Queen's Wake]]'' (1813), his collection of songs ''[[Jacobite Relics]]'' (1819), and his two novels ''[[The Three Perils of Man]]'' (1822), and ''[[The Three Perils of Woman]]'' (1823).\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nJames Hogg was born on a small farm near [[Ettrick, Scotland]] in 1770 and was [[baptized]] there on 9 December, his actual date of birth having never been recorded.<ref name=\"literary\">{{Cite web| last=Hughes | first=Gillian | title=James Hogg | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2168 | date=5 November 2001 | publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia | accessdate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> His father, Robert Hogg (1729\u20131820), was a tenant farmer while his mother, Margaret Hogg (n\u00e9e Laidlaw) (1730\u20131813), was noted for collecting native Scottish [[ballad]]s.<ref name=\"literary\"/><ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Cite web | last=Gilbert | first=Suzanne | title=Hogg, Traditional Culture, and The Mountain Bard | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | date=19 May 2006 | publisher=University of Stirling | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212803/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Margaret Laidlaw's father, known as Will o' Phawhope, was said to have been the last man in the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Border country]] to speak with the [[Fairy|fairies]].<ref name=\"Buchan\">{{cite book |title=Sir Walter Scott |last=Buchan |first=John |year=1961 |publisher=Cassell |page=62 }}</ref> James was the second eldest of four brothers, his siblings being William, David, and Robert (from eldest to youngest).<ref name=\"stirling\">{{Cite web | title=Sketch of the Life of the Ettrick Shepherd | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | publisher=[[University of Stirling]] | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212825/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Robert and David later emigrated to the United States, while James and William remained in Scotland for their entire lives.<ref name=\"stirling\"/>\n\nJames attended a parish school for a few months before his education was stopped due to his father's bankruptcy as a stock-farmer and sheep-dealer. Robert Hogg was then given the position of shepherd at Ettrickhouse farm by one of his neighbours. James worked as a farm servant throughout his childhood, tending cows, doing general farm work, and acting as a shepherd's assistant. His early experiences of literature and story telling came from the Bible and his mother's and uncle's stories.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlvi</ref> In 1784 he purchased a fiddle with money that he had saved, and taught himself how to play it. In 1785 he served a year working for a tenant farmer at Singlee. In 1786 he went to work for Mr. Laidlaw of Ellibank, staying with him for eighteen months. In 1788 he was given his first job as a shepherd by Laidlaw's father, a farmer at Willenslee. He stayed here for two years, learning to read while tending sheep, and being given newspapers and theological works by his employer's wife.<ref>Duncan (2004) pp. xlvi\u2013xlvii</ref>\n[[File:Farmhouse at Blackhouse - geograph.org.uk - 2921.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The farmhouse at Blackhouse, where Hogg worked as a young man]]\n\nIn 1790 he began ten years of service to James Laidlaw of Blackhouse in the [[Yarrow Water|Yarrow]] valley. Hogg later said that Laidlaw was more like a father to him than an employer. Seeing how hard he was working to improve himself, Laidlaw offered to help by making books available for Hogg from his own library, and through a local lending library. Hogg also began composing songs to be sung by local girls. He became a lifelong friend of his master's son, William Laidlaw, himself a minor writer and later the [[amanuensis]] of Walter Scott. It was at this time that Hogg, his eldest brother, and several cousins, formed a literary society of shepherds.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\">Duncan (2004) p. xlvii</ref>\n\nHogg first became familiar with the work of the recently deceased [[Robert Burns]] in 1797, after having the poem ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'' read to him. During this period Hogg wrote plays and pastorals, and continued producing songs. His work as a sheep drover stimulated an interest in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. In 1800 he left Blackhouse to help take care of his parents at Ettrickhouse. His collection ''Scottish Pastorals'' was published early in 1801 to favourable reviews. His patriotic song \"Donald Macdonald\" also achieved popularity.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\"/>\n\n===Career===\nIn 1801 Hogg was recruited to collect ballads for [[Walter Scott]]'s collection ''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''. He met Scott himself the following year and began working for the ''Edinburgh Magazine''.<ref>Batho (1927) pp. 18\u201322</ref> In the summer of 1802 he embarked on the first of three tours of the Highlands with a view to securing a farm of his own.<ref>Gilkison, Bruce (2016), ''Walking with James Hogg'', Edinburgh University Press</ref> He eventually found a farm on Harris but due to trouble with his finances and a legal issue he was unable to secure a lease by 1804. His experiences on his Highland tours were described in letters to Scott which were published in the ''Scots Magazine''.<ref>Laughlan, William F. (Ed.)

(Ed.), ''Highland Journeys'', The Collected Works of James Hogg, Stirling /South Carolina Edition, Edinburgh University Press</ref> On his way back to Ettrickhouse in 1803 he dined with the novelist [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] in Greenock. In 1805\u201306 he worked as a shepherd, meeting the poet [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] and becoming friends with him and his family. In October 1806 he became the lover of a young woman named Catherine Henderson.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlviii\">Duncan (2004) p. xlviii</ref>\n\nHis first collection, ''[[The Mountain Bard]]'', was published in February 1807 by [[Constable & Robinson|Constable]]. At the end of summer 1807 his daughter by Catherine Henderson was born, baptized on 13 December as Catherine Hogg. In 1837 she married David Lauder<ref>Old Parish Registers for St.Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, marriage took place on 20 November 1837</ref> and they named their son James Hogg Lauder.<ref>Informant on his mother's Death Certificate 17 August 1857.</ref> Catherine Henderson herself went on to marry David Laidlaw in 1812.<ref>Old Parish Registers for Ettrick, Roxburghshire</ref> Hogg continued working as a sheep-grazer for other farmers, but his debts began to grow throughout 1808\u20131809. At the end of 1809 he began an affair with Elizabeth Beattie, and soon after absconded from his creditors, returning in disgrace to Ettrick.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlviii\"/>\n\nIn 1810 he moved to [[Edinburgh]] to start a literary career. In March 1810 his daughter by Elizabeth Beattie was born, christened Elizabeth Hogg in June. At the end of 1810 he met his future wife Margaret Phillips. His magazine ''[[The Spy (periodical by James Hogg)|The Spy]]'', begun in 1810, ended after a year. At this time he became a member of a debate society called ''The Forum'', eventually serving as its secretary. In 1812 he started planning a long poetical work. ''The Queen's Wake'' (the setting of which was the return to Scotland of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in 1561 after her exile in France), was published in 1813 and was a success. It was, in the guise of a competition, a collection of verse tales, of which ''Kilmeny'' became and remained the best known.  At the end of 1813 he began writing what would later become his well-known poem ''[[Mador of the Moor]]''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlix</ref>\n\nIn Summer of 1813 Hogg's mother died. In 1814 he met [[William Wordsworth]] and made a visit to the Lake District to see Wordsworth and other poets. In 1815 the Duke of Buccleuch granted him a small farm at Eltrive Moss, where he could live rent-free for his lifetime. He continued to write songs and poems, including \"The Field of Waterloo\" and \"To the Ancient Banner of Buccleuch\". His poem ''Mador of the Moor'' was published in 1816. Later in the year he published his collection of parodies ''The Poetic Mirror'', achieving a marked success.<ref>Duncan (2004) pp. xlix\u2013l</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg by W. Nicholson.jpg|thumb|James Hogg, detail of an oil painting by W. Nicholson]]\n\nHogg first met the publisher [[William Blackwood]] in the aftermath of his own publisher John Goldie's 1814 bankruptcy, and in 1817 he helped with the start of Blackwood's  ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Edinburgh Monthly Magazine]]''.<ref>Batho (1927) pp. 69, 93\u201394</ref> He published his two volume collection ''Dramatic Tales'' in May. In 1818 his collection ''The Brownie of Bodsbeck and Other Tales'' was published by Blackwood. At this time Hogg was busy with his work ''[[Jacobite Relics]]''. In 1819 he proposed marriage to Margaret Phillips. At the end of the year he published the first volume of ''Jacobite Relics''. He married Margaret Phillips on 28 April 1820. His second tales collection ''[[Winter Evening Tales]]'' was published a month later. At the end of the year his father died. The second volume of ''Jacobite Relics'' was published in February 1821, and his son James Robert Hogg was born in March 1821. Around this time, Hogg began having serious financial problems.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. li</ref>\n\nIt was through the ''Edinburgh Monthly Magazine'', soon renamed ''Blackwood's Magazine'', that Hogg found fame, although it was not the sort that he wanted. Launched as a counter-blast to the Whig ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', Blackwood wanted punchy content in his new publication. He found his ideal contributors in [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (who wrote as Christopher North) and [[John Gibson Lockhart]] (later Walter Scott's son-in-law and biographer). Their first published article, \"The Chaldee Manuscript\", a thinly disguised satire of Edinburgh society in biblical language which Hogg started and Wilson and Lockhart elaborated, was so controversial<ref>Duncan (2004) p. l</ref> that Wilson fled and Blackwood was forced to apologise. Soon Blackwood's Tory views and reviews \u2013 often scurrilous attacks on other writers \u2013 were notorious, and the magazine, or \"Maga\" as it came to be known, had become one of the best-selling journals of its day.\n\nBut Hogg quickly found himself forced out of the inner circle. As other writers such as Walter Maginn and [[Thomas de Quincey]] joined, he became not merely excluded from the lion's share of publication in Maga, but a figure of fun in its pages. Wilson and Lockhart were dangerous friends. Hogg's ''Memoirs of the Author's Life'' were savagely attacked by an anonymous reviewer, causing Hogg to temporarily break with ''Blackwood's'', and go to work for Constable's smaller ''Edinburgh Magazine''.<ref name=\"Duncan\">Duncan (2004) p. lii</ref>\n\nIn 1822 the ''Maga'' launched the ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'' or \"Nights at Ambrose's\", imaginary conversations in a drinking-den between semi-fictional characters such as North, O'Doherty, The Opium Eater and the Ettrick Shepherd. The Shepherd was Hogg.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/> The ''Noctes'' continued until 1834, and were written after 1825 mostly by Wilson, although other writers, including Hogg himself, had a hand in them. The Shepherd of the ''Noctes'' is a part-animal, part-rural simpleton, and part-savant. He became one of the best-known figures in topical literary affairs, famous throughout Britain and its colonies. Quite what the real James Hogg made of this is mostly unknown, although some of his letters to Blackwood and others express outrage and anguish.\n\nHogg's ''Poetical Works'' in four volumes were published in 1822, as was his novel ''The Three Perils of Man''. In 1823, in debt to Blackwood, Hogg began publishing his work the ''Shepherd's Calendar'' in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Hogg's daughter Jessie was born in April, and later in the year he published his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman''. In June 1824 he published his best known work, the novel ''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner''. His epic poem ''[[Queen Hynde]]'' was published at the end of the year. In 1825 he found a new and lucrative market for his works as he began publishing in a literary annual called the ''Literary Souvenir''.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/>\n\nIn 1825 Hogg's daughter Maggie was born, and he began writing a new prose work, later titled ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose''.  In 1826 Hogg was in serious trouble with his debts, while the firm of Constable collapsed, involving Walter Scott and Hogg's friend John Aiken. In 1827 his debts began to lighten as his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' pieces were being published, and he was getting more and more applications to contribute to annuals. The death of his father-in-law, whose family Hogg had been supporting, gave him relief. His third daughter Harriet was born at the end of the year. Hogg's collection ''Select and Rare Scottish Melodies'' was published in 1828, and he continued to write songs and contribute to annuals throughout 1828\u201329, while his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' was published in book form in Spring, 1829.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liii</ref>\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Ettrick Parish Church - geograph.org.uk - 902352.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ettrick Parish Church, where Hogg is buried]]\n[[File:James Hogg as depicted on the Scott Monument.JPG|thumb|240px|James Hogg as depicted on the [[Scott Monument]]]]\nIn 1830 he started publishing in the new ''Fraser's Magazine'', and at the end of the year he met with Walter Scott for the last time. In early 1831 Hogg's ''Songs by the Ettrick Shepherd'' was published, but the publishing of the companion volume ''A Queer Book'' was held up by Blackwood. Hogg's last child, his daughter Mary, was born in August. At the end of the year he quarrelled with Blackwood, and decided to publish his works in [[London]]. In 1832 his ''Altrive Tales'' was published in London, while Blackwood finally published ''A Queer Book'' in April. Hogg was offered a large sum to edit a collection of the works of Robert Burns, but the bankruptcy of his London publisher stopped the publication of his ''Altrive Tales''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liv</ref>\n\nIn 1833 Hogg had an accident while [[curling]], falling through the ice, causing a serious illness. In 1834 his biographical work ''Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott'' was published in the United States, while a pirated version published in Edinburgh led to a break with Lockhart. Hogg mended his relationship with Blackwood in May, but Blackwood died at the end of the year. Hogg published ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose'' at the beginning of 1835.\n\n===Death===\n\nJames Hogg died on 21 November 1835 and was buried in Ettrick Churchyard, close to his childhood home.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. lv</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg death mask.JPG|thumb|140px|Hogg's death mask on display in [[Selkirk, Scotland|Selkirk]]]]\n[[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] 1835 \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\", written in the year of his death, includes the lines:\n\n<poem>The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,\n'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;\nAnd death upon the braes of Yarrow,\nHas closed the Shepherd-poet's eyes.</poem> \n\nThis [[eulogy]] notwithstanding, Wordsworth's notes state \"He was undoubtedly a man of original genius, but of coarse manners and low and offensive opinions.\"<ref>Wordsworth, William (1835) [http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519184531/http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html |date=19 May 2009 }} Virginia University.

Now his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman'' is also considered a classic and all his work, including his letters, is undergoing major publication in the Stirling/South Carolina editions.  However, ''Justified Sinner'' remains his most important work and is now seen as one of the major Scottish novels of its time, and absolutely crucial in terms of exploring one of the key themes of [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish culture]] and identity: [[Calvinism]].  In a 2006 interview with [[Melvyn Bragg]] for [[ITV1]], Scottish novelist [[Irvine Welsh]] cited Hogg, especially ''The Confessions'' as a major influence on his writing.

As a young man he worked as a shepherd and farmhand, and was largely self-educated through reading. He was a friend of many of the great writers of his day, including [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], of whom he later wrote an [[unauthorized biography]]. He became widely known as the \"'''Ettrick Shepherd'''\", a nickname under which some of his works were published, and the character name he was given in the widely read series ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'', published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. He is best known today for his novel ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]''. His other works include the long poem ''[[The Queen's Wake]]'' (1813), his collection of songs ''[[Jacobite Relics]]'' (1819), and his two novels ''[[The Three Perils of Man]]'' (1822), and ''[[The Three Perils of Woman]]'' (1823).\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nJames Hogg was born on a small farm near [[Ettrick, Scotland]] in 1770 and was [[baptized]] there on 9 December, his actual date of birth having never been recorded.<ref name=\"literary\">{{Cite web| last=Hughes | first=Gillian | title=James Hogg | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2168 | date=5 November 2001 | publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia | accessdate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> His father, Robert Hogg (1729\u20131820), was a tenant farmer while his mother, Margaret Hogg (n\u00e9e Laidlaw) (1730\u20131813), was noted for collecting native Scottish [[ballad]]s.<ref name=\"literary\"/><ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Cite web | last=Gilbert | first=Suzanne | title=Hogg, Traditional Culture, and The Mountain Bard | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | date=19 May 2006 | publisher=University of Stirling | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212803/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=78&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Margaret Laidlaw's father, known as Will o' Phawhope, was said to have been the last man in the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Border country]] to speak with the [[Fairy|fairies]].<ref name=\"Buchan\">{{cite book |title=Sir Walter Scott |last=Buchan |first=John |year=1961 |publisher=Cassell |page=62 }}</ref> James was the second eldest of four brothers, his siblings being William, David, and Robert (from eldest to youngest).<ref name=\"stirling\">{{Cite web | title=Sketch of the Life of the Ettrick Shepherd | url=http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | publisher=[[University of Stirling]] | accessdate=1 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721212825/http://www.jameshogg.stir.ac.uk/showrecord.php?id=23&fulltext=1 | archivedate=21 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Robert and David later emigrated to the United States, while James and William remained in Scotland for their entire lives.<ref name=\"stirling\"/>\n\nJames attended a parish school for a few months before his education was stopped due to his father's bankruptcy as a stock-farmer and sheep-dealer. Robert Hogg was then given the position of shepherd at Ettrickhouse farm by one of his neighbours. James worked as a farm servant throughout his childhood, tending cows, doing general farm work, and acting as a shepherd's assistant. His early experiences of literature and story telling came from the Bible and his mother's and uncle's stories.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlvi</ref> In 1784 he purchased a fiddle with money that he had saved, and taught himself how to play it. In 1785 he served a year working for a tenant farmer at Singlee. In 1786 he went to work for Mr. Laidlaw of Ellibank, staying with him for eighteen months. In 1788 he was given his first job as a shepherd by Laidlaw's father, a farmer at Willenslee. He stayed here for two years, learning to read while tending sheep, and being given newspapers and theological works by his employer's wife.<ref>Duncan (2004) pp. xlvi\u2013xlvii</ref>\n[[File:Farmhouse at Blackhouse - geograph.org.uk - 2921.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The farmhouse at Blackhouse, where Hogg worked as a young man]]\n\nIn 1790 he began ten years of service to James Laidlaw of Blackhouse in the [[Yarrow Water|Yarrow]] valley. Hogg later said that Laidlaw was more like a father to him than an employer. Seeing how hard he was working to improve himself, Laidlaw offered to help by making books available for Hogg from his own library, and through a local lending library. Hogg also began composing songs to be sung by local girls. He became a lifelong friend of his master's son, William Laidlaw, himself a minor writer and later the [[amanuensis]] of Walter Scott. It was at this time that Hogg, his eldest brother, and several cousins, formed a literary society of shepherds.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\">Duncan (2004) p. xlvii</ref>\n\nHogg first became familiar with the work of the recently deceased [[Robert Burns]] in 1797, after having the poem ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'' read to him. During this period Hogg wrote plays and pastorals, and continued producing songs. His work as a sheep drover stimulated an interest in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. In 1800 he left Blackhouse to help take care of his parents at Ettrickhouse. His collection ''Scottish Pastorals'' was published early in 1801 to favourable reviews. His patriotic song \"Donald Macdonald\" also achieved popularity.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlvii\"/>\n\n===Career===\nIn 1801 Hogg was recruited to collect ballads for [[Walter Scott]]'s collection ''[[Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''. He met Scott himself the following year and began working for the ''Edinburgh Magazine''.<ref>Batho (1927) pp. 18\u201322</ref> In the summer of 1802 he embarked on the first of three tours of the Highlands with a view to securing a farm of his own.<ref>Gilkison, Bruce (2016), ''Walking with James Hogg'', Edinburgh University Press</ref> He eventually found a farm on Harris but due to trouble with his finances and a legal issue he was unable to secure a lease by 1804.

In October 1806 he became the lover of a young woman named Catherine Henderson.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlviii\">Duncan (2004) p. xlviii</ref>\n\nHis first collection, ''[[The Mountain Bard]]'', was published in February 1807 by [[Constable & Robinson|Constable]]. At the end of summer 1807 his daughter by Catherine Henderson was born, baptized on 13 December as Catherine Hogg.

At the end of 1809 he began an affair with Elizabeth Beattie, and soon after absconded from his creditors, returning in disgrace to Ettrick.<ref name=\"Duncan 2004 p. xlviii\"/>\n\nIn 1810 he moved to [[Edinburgh]] to start a literary career. In March 1810 his daughter by Elizabeth Beattie was born, christened Elizabeth Hogg in June. At the end of 1810 he met his future wife Margaret Phillips. His magazine ''[[The Spy (periodical by James Hogg)|The Spy]]'', begun in 1810, ended after a year. At this time he became a member of a debate society called ''The Forum'', eventually serving as its secretary. In 1812 he started planning a long poetical work. ''The Queen's Wake'' (the setting of which was the return to Scotland of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in 1561 after her exile in France), was published in 1813 and was a success. It was, in the guise of a competition, a collection of verse tales, of which ''Kilmeny'' became and remained the best known.  At the end of 1813 he began writing what would later become his well-known poem ''[[Mador of the Moor]]''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. xlix</ref>\n\nIn Summer of 1813 Hogg's mother died. In 1814 he met [[William Wordsworth]] and made a visit to the Lake District to see Wordsworth and other poets. In 1815 the Duke of Buccleuch granted him a small farm at Eltrive Moss, where he could live rent-free for his lifetime. He continued to write songs and poems, including \"The Field of Waterloo\" and \"To the Ancient Banner of Buccleuch\". His poem ''Mador of the Moor'' was published in 1816. Later in the year he published his collection of parodies ''The Poetic Mirror'', achieving a marked success.<ref>Duncan (2004) pp. xlix\u2013l</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg by W. Nicholson.jpg|thumb|James Hogg, detail of an oil painting by W. Nicholson]]\n\nHogg first met the publisher [[William Blackwood]] in the aftermath of his own publisher John Goldie's 1814 bankruptcy, and in 1817 he helped with the start of Blackwood's  ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Edinburgh Monthly Magazine]]''.<ref>Batho (1927) pp. 69, 93\u201394</ref> He published his two volume collection ''Dramatic Tales'' in May. In 1818 his collection ''The Brownie of Bodsbeck and Other Tales'' was published by Blackwood. At this time Hogg was busy with his work ''[[Jacobite Relics]]''. In 1819 he proposed marriage to Margaret Phillips. At the end of the year he published the first volume of ''Jacobite Relics''. He married Margaret Phillips on 28 April 1820. His second tales collection ''[[Winter Evening Tales]]'' was published a month later. At the end of the year his father died. The second volume of ''Jacobite Relics'' was published in February 1821, and his son James Robert Hogg was born in March 1821. Around this time, Hogg began having serious financial problems.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. li</ref>\n\nIt was through the ''Edinburgh Monthly Magazine'', soon renamed ''Blackwood's Magazine'', that Hogg found fame, although it was not the sort that he wanted. Launched as a counter-blast to the Whig ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', Blackwood wanted punchy content in his new publication. He found his ideal contributors in [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] (who wrote as Christopher North) and [[John Gibson Lockhart]] (later Walter Scott's son-in-law and biographer). Their first published article, \"The Chaldee Manuscript\", a thinly disguised satire of Edinburgh society in biblical language which Hogg started and Wilson and Lockhart elaborated, was so controversial<ref>Duncan (2004) p. l</ref> that Wilson fled and Blackwood was forced to apologise. Soon Blackwood's Tory views and reviews \u2013 often scurrilous attacks on other writers \u2013 were notorious, and the magazine, or \"Maga\" as it came to be known, had become one of the best-selling journals of its day.\n\nBut Hogg quickly found himself forced out of the inner circle. As other writers such as Walter Maginn and [[Thomas de Quincey]] joined, he became not merely excluded from the lion's share of publication in Maga, but a figure of fun in its pages. Wilson and Lockhart were dangerous friends. Hogg's ''Memoirs of the Author's Life'' were savagely attacked by an anonymous reviewer, causing Hogg to temporarily break with ''Blackwood's'', and go to work for Constable's smaller ''Edinburgh Magazine''.<ref name=\"Duncan\">Duncan (2004) p. lii</ref>\n\nIn 1822 the ''Maga'' launched the ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'' or \"Nights at Ambrose's\", imaginary conversations in a drinking-den between semi-fictional characters such as North, O'Doherty, The Opium Eater and the Ettrick Shepherd. The Shepherd was Hogg.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/> The ''Noctes'' continued until 1834, and were written after 1825 mostly by Wilson, although other writers, including Hogg himself, had a hand in them. The Shepherd of the ''Noctes'' is a part-animal, part-rural simpleton, and part-savant. He became one of the best-known figures in topical literary affairs, famous throughout Britain and its colonies. Quite what the real James Hogg made of this is mostly unknown, although some of his letters to Blackwood and others express outrage and anguish.\n\nHogg's ''Poetical Works'' in four volumes were published in 1822, as was his novel ''The Three Perils of Man''. In 1823, in debt to Blackwood, Hogg began publishing his work the ''Shepherd's Calendar'' in ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Hogg's daughter Jessie was born in April, and later in the year he published his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman''. In June 1824 he published his best known work, the novel ''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner''. His epic poem ''Queen Hynde'' was published at the end of the year. In 1825 he found a new and lucrative market for his works as he began publishing in a literary annual called the ''Literary Souvenir''.<ref name=\"Duncan\"/>\n\nIn 1825 Hogg's daughter Maggie was born, and he began writing a new prose work, later titled ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose''.  In 1826 Hogg was in serious trouble with his debts, while the firm of Constable collapsed, involving Walter Scott and Hogg's friend John Aiken. In 1827 his debts began to lighten as his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' pieces were being published, and he was getting more and more applications to contribute to annuals. The death of his father-in-law, whose family Hogg had been supporting, gave him relief. His third daughter Harriet was born at the end of the year. Hogg's collection ''Select and Rare Scottish Melodies'' was published in 1828, and he continued to write songs and contribute to annuals throughout 1828\u201329, while his ''Shepherd's Calendar'' was published in book form in Spring, 1829.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liii</ref>\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Ettrick Parish Church - geograph.org.uk - 902352.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ettrick Parish Church, where Hogg is buried]]\n[[File:James Hogg as depicted on the Scott Monument.JPG|thumb|240px|James Hogg as depicted on the [[Scott Monument]]]]\nIn 1830 he started publishing in the new ''Fraser's Magazine'', and at the end of the year he met with Walter Scott for the last time. In early 1831 Hogg's ''Songs by the Ettrick Shepherd'' was published, but the publishing of the companion volume ''A Queer Book'' was held up by Blackwood. Hogg's last child, his daughter Mary, was born in August. At the end of the year he quarrelled with Blackwood, and decided to publish his works in [[London]]. In 1832 his ''Altrive Tales'' was published in London, while Blackwood finally published ''A Queer Book'' in April. Hogg was offered a large sum to edit a collection of the works of Robert Burns, but the bankruptcy of his London publisher stopped the publication of his ''Altrive Tales''.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. liv</ref>\n\nIn 1833 Hogg had an accident while [[curling]], falling through the ice, causing a serious illness. In 1834 his biographical work ''Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott'' was published in the United States, while a pirated version published in Edinburgh led to a break with Lockhart. Hogg mended his relationship with Blackwood in May, but Blackwood died at the end of the year. Hogg published ''Tales of the Wars of Montrose'' at the beginning of 1835.\n\n===Death===\n\nJames Hogg died on 21 November 1835 and was buried in Ettrick Churchyard, close to his childhood home.<ref>Duncan (2004) p. lv</ref>\n[[File:James Hogg death mask.JPG|thumb|140px|Hogg's death mask on display in [[Selkirk, Scotland|Selkirk]]]]\n[[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] 1835 \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\", written in the year of his death, includes the lines:\n\n<poem>The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,\n'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;\nAnd death upon the braes of Yarrow,\nHas closed the Shepherd-poet's eyes.</poem> \n\nThis [[eulogy]] notwithstanding, Wordsworth's notes state \"He was undoubtedly a man of original genius, but of coarse manners and low and offensive opinions.\"<ref>Wordsworth, William (1835) [http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html \"Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519184531/http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Wordsworth/poems/Extemp_Effusion_on_Death.html |date=19 May 2009 }} Virginia University. Retrieved 25 July 209.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nAmong the reading public at large Hogg was, during his lifetime, one of the most admired writers of the day, but this admiration was largely for his success in overcoming the disadvantages of his peasant birth and lack of education.  He was considered a man of great natural genius whose uncouth style and subject-matter, so natural for the clownish figure depicted in the ''Noctes Ambrosianae'', should not be held against him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anecdotes of Scott |first=James |last=Hogg |year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn= 0-7486-2085-0 |pages=v\u2013vi }}</ref> A collected edition of his works was published in the 1830s, after Hogg's death, pruned of some passages which offended the increasing delicacy of the age, and another ''Works of the Ettrick Shepherd'' was prepared in the 1860s which took the process even further; some works, for example ''The Three Perils of Woman'', were excluded altogether.  Victorian readers of these emasculated texts naturally came to the conclusion that Hogg had been overrated, and that he was notable mainly as an example of triumph over adverse circumstances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anecdotes of Scott |first=James |last=Hogg |year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh, UK |isbn= 0-7486-2085-0 |page=vi }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13470 | year=2004 | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=19 March 2012 | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/13470 | last1=Mack | first1=Douglas S. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature | url=http://www.bartleby.com/221/1026.html | date=1907\u20131921| publisher=Bartleby | accessdate=19 March 2012 }}</ref> Apart from ''Justified Sinner'', which even his detractors acknowledged as unusually powerful (and often attributed to someone else, usually Lockhart), his novels were regarded as turgid, his verse as light, his short tales and articles as ephemera.\n[[File:Monument to James Hogg - geograph.org.uk - 1524995.jpg|thumb|right|200px|James Hogg monument at [[St Mary's Loch]] by [[Andrew Currie (sculptor)|Andrew Currie]]]]\nThis situation only began to change in 1924, when the French writer [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] was loaned ''Justified Sinner'' by [[Raymond Mortimer]].

Growing interest in ''The Confessions'' led to the rediscovery and reconsideration of his other work in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Now his novel ''The Three Perils of Woman'' is also considered a classic and all his work, including his letters, is undergoing major publication in the Stirling/South Carolina editions.  However, ''Justified Sinner'' remains his most important work and is now seen as one of the major Scottish novels of its time, and absolutely crucial in terms of exploring one of the key themes of [[Culture of Scotland|Scottish culture]] and identity: [[Calvinism]].  In a 2006 interview with [[Melvyn Bragg]] for [[ITV1]], Scottish novelist [[Irvine Welsh]] cited Hogg, especially ''The Confessions'' as a major influence on his writing.  A James Hogg Society was founded in 1981 to encourage the study of his life and writings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=The James Hogg Society | url=http://www.english.stir.ac.uk/research/profile/hogg-society/jameshogghome-page.php | publisher=[[University of Stirling]] | accessdate=19 March 2012 }}</ref> Hogg's story \"The Brownie of the Black Haggs\" was dramatised for BBC radio 4 in 2003 by Scottish playwright Marty Ross as part of his \"Darker Side of the Border\" series.

The county executive is elected in a countywide vote. The County Executive is [[Joe Parisi]]. The Board of Supervisors consists of 37 members, each elected from single member districts. As the policy-making body of the county government, the Board of Supervisors enacts county ordinances, levies taxes, and appropriates money for services.\n\n==Politics==\nDane County has supported the Democratic nominee for president all but five times since 1912, and in every election since 1960. In that time, Republicans have only crossed the 40 percent mark four times. Historically, it has been the second-strongest Democratic bastion in the state; only the rural and heavily Native American [[Menominee County]] is more Democratic.\n\nDane County was one of the few counties in the United States to elect a member of the Green Party into county-level office; that official was [[Leland Pan]].\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
