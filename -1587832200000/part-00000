Their early releases (''Moon Alert'', ''[[Hunchback (video game)|Hunchback]]'', ''[[High Noon (computer game)|High Noon]]'', ''Gilligan's Gold'', ''Daley Thompson's Decathlon'' etc.) were developed in-house, but later in 1984 Ocean Software acquired its former [[Liverpool]] rival, the defunct software developer [[Imagine Software|Imagine]], and focus shifted from development to publication of games.

These bending seams are printed in a state of stress but do not deform until exposed to light. The active agent that induces bending in the material is heat transmitted by intense light. The material itself is made of chemical photo-reactive polymers. These compounds use a polymer mixture combined with a [[photoinitiator]] to create an amorphous, covalently cross-linked polymer. This material is formed into sheets and loaded in tension perpendicular to the desired bending crease. The material is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light, as the [[photoinitiator]] is consumed it polymerizes the remaining mixture, inducing photoinitiated stress relaxation. The portion of material exposed to the light can be controlled with stencils to create specific bending patterns. It is also possible to run multiple iterations of this process using the same material sample with different loading conditions or stencil masks for each iteration. The final form will depend on the order and resulting form of each iteration.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Current applications ==\n[[File:4D printed soy resin.jpg|thumb|Miao et al.

This resin is made of a renewable soybean-oil epoxidized acrylate compound that is also biocompatible.

A laser 3D-printed sample of this resin was subjected to temperature fluctuations from -18&nbsp;\u00b0C to 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and exhibited full recovery of its original shape. Printed scaffolds of this material proved to be successful foundations for human bone marrow [[mesenchymal stem cell]] (hMSCs) growth. This material's strong qualities of shape memory effect and biocompatibility lead researchers to believe that it will strongly advance the development of biomedical scaffolds. This research article is one of the first that explores the use of plant oil polymers as liquid resins for [[stereolithography]] production in biomedical applications.\n\nResearch team of Leonid Ionov (University of Bayreuth) has developed novel approach to print shape-morphing biocompatible/biodegradable hydrogels with living cells. The approach allows fabrication of hollow self-folding tubes with unprecedented control over their diameters and architectures at high resolution. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by employing two different biopolymers (alginate and hyaluronic acid) and mouse bone marrow stromal cells. Harnessing the printing and post-printing parameters allows attaining average internal tube diameters as low as 20&nbsp;\u03bcm, which is not yet achievable by other existing bioprinting approaches and is comparable to the diameters of the smallest blood vessels. The proposed 4D bioprinting process does not pose any negative effect on the viability of the printed cells, and the self-folded hydrogel-based tubes support cell survival for at least 7 days without any decrease in cell viability. Consequently, the presented 4D bioprinting strategy allows the fabrication of dynamically reconfigurable architectures with tunable functionality and responsiveness, governed by the selection of suitable materials and cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kirillova|first=Alina|last2=Maxson|first2=Ridge|last3=Stoychev|first3=Georgi|last4=Gomillion|first4=Cheryl T.|last5=Ionov|first5=Leonid|title=4D Biofabrication Using Shape-Morphing Hydrogels|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=29|issue=46|language=en|pages=n/a|doi=10.1002/adma.201703443|pmid=29024044|issn=1521-4095|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n== Possible Applications ==\nThere are some existing techniques/technologies that could potentially be applied and adjusted for 4D printing.\n\n=== Cell Traction Force ===\nCell Traction Force (CTF) is a technique wherein living cells fold and move microstructures into their designed shape. This is possible through the contraction that occurs from [[actin]] polymerization and [[actomyosin]] interactions within the cell. In natural processes, CTF regulates wound healing, [[angiogenesis]], [[metastasis]], and [[inflammation]]. Takeuchi et al. seeded cells across two microplates, and when the glass structure was removed the cells would bridge the gap across the microplate and thus initiate self-folding. The team was able to create vessel-like geometries and even high throughput dodecahedrons with this method. There is speculation that utilizing this technique of cell origami will lead to designing and printing a cell-laden structure that can mimic their non-synthetic counterparts after the printing process has completed.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Electrical and Magnetic Smart Materials ===\nThe electrical responsive materials that exist today change their size and shape depending on the intensity and/or direction of an external electric field. [[Polyaniline]] and [[polypyrrole]] (PPy) are, in particular, good conducting materials and can be doped with [[tetrafluoroborate]] to contract and expand under an electric stimulus. A robot made of these materials was made to move using an electric pulse of 3V for 5 seconds, causing one leg to extend, then removing the stimulus for 10 seconds, causing the other leg to move forward. Research on [[carbon nanotube]]s, which are [[biocompatible]] and highly conductive, indicates that a composite made of carbon nanotube and a shape memory specimen has a higher [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] and speed of electro-active response than either specimen alone. Magnetically responsive ferrogels contract in the presence of a strong magnetic field and thus have applications in drug and cell delivery. The combination of [[carbon nanotube]]s and magnetically responsive particles has been bioprinted for use in promoting cell growth and adhesion, while still maintaining a strong conductivity.\n\n=== Commerce and transportation ===\nSkylar Tibbits elaborates on future applications of 4D-printed materials as programmable products that can be tailored to specific environments and respond to factors such as the temperature, humidity, pressure, and sound of one's body or environment. Tibbits also mentions the advantage of 4D-printing for shipping applications - it will allow products to be packaged flat to later have their designed shape activated on site by a simple stimulus. There is also the possibility of 4D-printed shipping containers that react to forces in transit to uniformly distribute loads. It is very likely that 4D-printed materials will be able to repair themselves after failure. These materials will be able to self-disassemble, making their constituent parts easy to recycle.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Four-dimensional product]]\n* [[Responsive architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:3D printing]]\n", "text_old": "{{overly detailed|date=November 2018}}\n'''4-dimensional printing''' ('''4D printing'''; also known as '''4D bioprinting''', '''active origami''', or '''shape-morphing systems''') uses the same techniques of [[3D printing]] through computer-programmed deposition of material in successive layers to create a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] object.

This stress can later be released, causing an overall material shape change.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal |last=Ryu |first=Jennie |last2=D'Amato |first2=Matteo |last3=Cui|first3=Xiaodong|last4=Long |first4= Kevin N. |last5=Qi |first5=H.

These bending seams are printed in a state of stress but do not deform until exposed to light. The active agent that induces bending in the material is heat transmitted by intense light. The material itself is made of chemical photo-reactive polymers. These compounds use a polymer mixture combined with a [[photoinitiator]] to create an amorphous, covalently cross-linked polymer. This material is formed into sheets and loaded in tension perpendicular to the desired bending crease. The material is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light, as the [[photoinitiator]] is consumed it polymerizes the remaining mixture, inducing photoinitiated stress relaxation. The portion of material exposed to the light can be controlled with stencils to create specific bending patterns. It is also possible to run multiple iterations of this process using the same material sample with different loading conditions or stencil masks for each iteration. The final form will depend on the order and resulting form of each iteration.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Current applications ==\n[[File:4D printed soy resin.jpg|thumb|Miao et al.

This resin is made of a renewable soybean-oil epoxidized acrylate compound that is also biocompatible. This resin adds to the small group of 3D-printable resins and is one of the few that are biocompatible. A laser 3D-printed sample of this resin was subjected to temperature fluctuations from -18&nbsp;\u00b0C to 37&nbsp;\u00b0C and exhibited full recovery of its original shape. Printed scaffolds of this material proved to be successful foundations for human bone marrow [[mesenchymal stem cell]] (hMSCs) growth. This material's strong qualities of shape memory effect and biocompatibility lead researchers to believe that it will strongly advance the development of biomedical scaffolds. This research article is one of the first that explores the use of plant oil polymers as liquid resins for [[stereolithography]] production in biomedical applications.\n\nResearch team of Leonid Ionov (University of Bayreuth) has developed novel approach to print shape-morphing biocompatible/biodegradable hydrogels with living cells. The approach allows fabrication of hollow self-folding tubes with unprecedented control over their diameters and architectures at high resolution. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by employing two different biopolymers (alginate and hyaluronic acid) and mouse bone marrow stromal cells. Harnessing the printing and post-printing parameters allows attaining average internal tube diameters as low as 20&nbsp;\u03bcm, which is not yet achievable by other existing bioprinting approaches and is comparable to the diameters of the smallest blood vessels. The proposed 4D bioprinting process does not pose any negative effect on the viability of the printed cells, and the self-folded hydrogel-based tubes support cell survival for at least 7 days without any decrease in cell viability. Consequently, the presented 4D bioprinting strategy allows the fabrication of dynamically reconfigurable architectures with tunable functionality and responsiveness, governed by the selection of suitable materials and cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kirillova|first=Alina|last2=Maxson|first2=Ridge|last3=Stoychev|first3=Georgi|last4=Gomillion|first4=Cheryl T.|last5=Ionov|first5=Leonid|title=4D Biofabrication Using Shape-Morphing Hydrogels|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=29|issue=46|language=en|pages=n/a|doi=10.1002/adma.201703443|pmid=29024044|issn=1521-4095|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n== Possible Applications ==\nThere are some existing techniques/technologies that could potentially be applied and adjusted for 4D printing.\n\n=== Cell Traction Force ===\nCell Traction Force (CTF) is a technique wherein living cells fold and move microstructures into their designed shape. This is possible through the contraction that occurs from [[actin]] polymerization and [[actomyosin]] interactions within the cell. In natural processes, CTF regulates wound healing, [[angiogenesis]], [[metastasis]], and [[inflammation]]. Takeuchi et al. seeded cells across two microplates, and when the glass structure was removed the cells would bridge the gap across the microplate and thus initiate self-folding. The team was able to create vessel-like geometries and even high throughput dodecahedrons with this method. There is speculation that utilizing this technique of cell origami will lead to designing and printing a cell-laden structure that can mimic their non-synthetic counterparts after the printing process has completed.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Electrical and Magnetic Smart Materials ===\nThe electrical responsive materials that exist today change their size and shape depending on the intensity and/or direction of an external electric field. [[Polyaniline]] and [[polypyrrole]] (PPy) are, in particular, good conducting materials and can be doped with [[tetrafluoroborate]] to contract and expand under an electric stimulus. A robot made of these materials was made to move using an electric pulse of 3V for 5 seconds, causing one leg to extend, then removing the stimulus for 10 seconds, causing the other leg to move forward. Research on [[carbon nanotube]]s, which are [[biocompatible]] and highly conductive, indicates that a composite made of carbon nanotube and a shape memory specimen has a higher [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] and speed of electro-active response than either specimen alone. Magnetically responsive ferrogels contract in the presence of a strong magnetic field and thus have applications in drug and cell delivery. The combination of [[carbon nanotube]]s and magnetically responsive particles has been bioprinted for use in promoting cell growth and adhesion, while still maintaining a strong conductivity.\n\n=== Commerce and transportation ===\nSkylar Tibbits elaborates on future applications of 4D-printed materials as programmable products that can be tailored to specific environments and respond to factors such as the temperature, humidity, pressure, and sound of one's body or environment. Tibbits also mentions the advantage of 4D-printing for shipping applications - it will allow products to be packaged flat to later have their designed shape activated on site by a simple stimulus. There is also the possibility of 4D-printed shipping containers that react to forces in transit to uniformly distribute loads. It is very likely that 4D-printed materials will be able to repair themselves after failure. These materials will be able to self-disassemble, making their constituent parts easy to recycle.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Four-dimensional product]]\n* [[Responsive architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:3D printing]]\n", "name_user": "NadineRin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Tibbets \u2192 Tibbits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4D_printing"}
