Nevertheless, prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge.

The witnesses said after the pogrom that they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014 functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well.

It was well preplanned, initiated by the Germans, and utterly lacked any pogrom-like spontaneity.\" Chodakiewicz good arguments, Wr\u00f3bel wrote, are \"overshadowed by numerous flaws\", lack a sense of proportion, and make selective use of information from sources that support Chodakiewicz's view.

Nevertheless, prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge. The Jews anticipated a pogrom, but the local priest and rabbi stepped in, addressing the matter together.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=39}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by National Democracy's far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews.

He alleged that the Polish collaborators had included \"''Volksdeutsche'' (Polish citizens of German origin) and petty criminals\".{{sfn|Stachura|2007}} In response, [[Joanna Michlic]] and [[Antony Polonsky]] wrote a letter in 2008 to the editor of ''History'', expressing their strong disagreement with the \"content and tone\" of Stachura's review. According to Michlic and Polonsky, Chodakiewicz's and Stachura's conclusions were \"very far from those reached by most historians\", including Poland's [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. They wrote that Chodakiewicz and Stachura \"uphold a view of the Polish past which seeks to return to an untenable vision of modern Poland as solely victim and hero&nbsp;... It is a matter of considerable regret to us that you have allowed your journal to be used to advance this neo-nationalist agenda.\"{{sfn|Michlic|Polonsky|2008}} Stachura took exception to their letter. ''History'' declined to publish his reply; instead, it was posted on the website of ''Glaukopis'', a Polish journal.{{sfn|Stachura|2008}}\n\n===''Our Class'' (2009)===\nA 2009 play, ''Our Class'' by Polish [[playwright]] Tadeusz S\u0142obodzianek, dealing with a massacre of Jews by Poles in a small town during the Holocaust, was performed in London.<ref>Nathan, John (11 September 2009).

It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use [[smokeless powder]] ammunition. The new propellant powder, \"''[[Poudre B]]'',\" was [[nitrocellulose]]-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist [[Paul Vieille]].  Lieutenant Colonel [[Nicolas Lebel]] contributed a flat nosed 8&nbsp;mm [[full metal jacket bullet]] (\"''Balle M'',\" or \"''Balle Lebel''\"). Twelve years later, in 1898, a solid [[brass]] pointed ([[spitzer (bullet)|spitzer]]) and [[boat-tail bullet]] called \"''Balle D''\" was retained for all 8mm Lebel ammunition.  Each case was protected against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a primer cover and by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of [[8mm Lebel]] rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French infantry during World War I (1914\u20131918). Altogether, 3.45 million Lebel rifles were produced by the three French state factories between 1887 and 1916.<ref name=nra>{{harvnb|James|2014|pp=67\u201371&108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\n==Operation, features, and accessories==\nIn operation, the bolt is turned up to the vertical position until the two opposed front locking lugs are released from the receiver. At the end of the bolt's opening phase, a ramp on the receiver bridge forces the bolt to the rear thus providing leveraged extraction of the fired case. The rifle is fitted with a two-piece wood stock, and features a spring-loaded tubular magazine in the fore-end. Taking aim at intermediate distances is done with a ramp sight graduated between 400 and 800 meters. The ladder rear sight is adjustable from 850 to 2,400 meters. Flipping forward that ladder sight reveals the commonly used fixed combat sight up to 400 meters.<ref name=nra/> The Mle 1886 rifle has a 10-round capacity (eight in the under barrel tube magazine, one in the transporter, and one in the chamber). The Lebel rifle features a magazine cutoff on the right side of the receiver. When activated it prevents feeding cartridges from the magazine.<ref name=nra/>\n\nThe Mle 1886 Lebel rifle was issued with a long needle-like quadrangular [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]] [[bayonet]], the ''\u00c9p\u00e9e-Ba\u00efonnette Mod\u00e8le 1886'', with a length of 52&nbsp;cm. (20 in.). With its X-shaped cross section, the \u00e9p\u00e9e bayonet was optimized for thrusting, designed to readily penetrate thick clothing and leather. The bayonet was dubbed \"Rosalie\" by French soldiers who were issued it during World War I.<ref name=nra/>\n\n==Origins and development==\nHistorically, the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle was the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition.  This new  propellant powder,  made of stabilized nitrocellulose, was called \"''Poudre B''\" (\"Powder B\") and had just been invented in 1884 by [[Paul Vieille]] (1854-1934).  ''Poudre B'' was  three times as powerful as [[black powder]], for the same weight, and left virtually no residues of combustion.<ref name=nra/> For this last reason, the new powder enabled the reduction of the caliber. The increase of the bullet speed in the barrel required a stronger bullet than the older lead bullet. New cartridges were designed where the lead was placed in deformable metal.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=26}}\n\nShortly thereafter, in January 1886, the French war minister, General [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], requested the urgent application of these two technical breakthroughs to the design of a new infantry rifle.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=27}} He appointed General Tramond in charge of the project which had to be completed within one year. Firstly the 11mm Gras cartridge case was redesigned into an 8mm case, a transformation carried out by Gras and Lt. Colonel Desaleux. The repeating mechanism,  derived from the French Mle 1884 Gras-Kropatschek repeating rifle, was implemented by Albert Close and Louis Verdin at the Chatellerault arsenal. The bolt's two opposed front locking lugs, inspired from the two rear locking  lugs on the bolt of the earlier Swiss [[Vetterli rifle]], were designed by Colonel Bonnet. The  8mm flat nosed FMJ \"''Balle M''\" bullet was suggested by Tramond and designed by [[lieutenant-colonel|Lt. Colonel]] [[Nicolas Lebel]] after whom the rifle (and the caliber) are named. However, Lebel did not lead the team responsible for creating the new rifle. He amicably protested during his lifetime that Tramond and Gras were the two superior officers who jointly deserved that credit. Nevertheless, his name, which only designated the ''Balle M'' bullet as the \"''Balle Lebel'',\" informally stuck to the entire weapon.<ref name=nra/>\n\n[[File:Lebel 8mm round.jpg|thumb|left|The [[8mm Lebel]] ammunition, developed in 1886, the first [[smokeless powder]] cartridge to be made and adopted by any country. This round features the solid brass boat-tailed \"Balle D\" bullet introduced in 1901.]]\nThe Lebel followed the [[bolt action]] '''11mm Mle 1874''' [[Gras rifle|Gras]] and the '''Mle 1878''' French naval [[Kropatschek]] rifle designed by an Austrian, [[Alfred von Kropatschek]], and shared the latter's tubular magazine in the fore-end. Two transitional repeating infantry bolt-action rifles, still chambered for the 11mm Gras black-powder cartridge, followed the '''Mle 1878''' rifle: the '''Mle 1884''' and the '''Mle 1885''' rifles. The latter had a two-piece stock and a massive steel receiver and closely resembles the''' Mle 1886''' Lebel.<ref name=nra/>\n\nIn 1893, an improved version of the M1886 Lebel was designated '''Fusil Mle 1886 M (modifi\u00e9) 93'''. The most useful improvement was a modification of the bolt head so it would divert away from the shooter's face any hot gases escaping from a ruptured cartridge case. The firing pin and its rear knob had already been modified in 1887 while the stacking rod remained unchanged.<ref name=nra/> Lastly, the fixation of the rear sight onto the barrel was substantially improved during that 1893 modification.{{sfn|Lombard|1987|p={{page needed|date=July 2019}}}}\n\n[[File:Lebel breech portion.jpg|thumb|Lebel rifle breech portion]]\n[[File:Rifles1905-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Schematic image Nos. 3 and 4]]\nThe Lebel rifle was manufactured by three government arsenals: Ch\u00e2tellerault, St-Etienne and Tulle. It featured a two-piece stock and a massive receiver designed to withstand the higher pressures developed by the new smokeless powder-based cartridges. Between 1935 and 1940, a carbine-length (17.7&nbsp;inch barrel) version of the Lebel was issued to mounted colonial troops in North Africa. This short carbine version of the Lebel, called the '''Mle 1886 M93-R35''', was assembled in large numbers (about 50,000) at Manufacture d'Armes de Tulle (MAT), beginning in 1935. It used all of the Lebel's parts except for a newly manufactured shorter barrel of carbine length.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}Since the new carbine's tube magazine had to be shortened  as well, its magazine capacity was only three rounds.\n\nThe Lebel rifle design was not without any short comings. While ammunition had to be loaded into the design one at a time, other country's service rifles were being loaded with stripper clips at a much faster rate. The tube fed magazine also greatly affected the rifle's balance when being fired which could have been another short coming.<ref>Mike Searson (20 June 2018), Breach Bang Clear, https://www.breachbangclear.com/the-1886-lebel/</ref>\n\n==Competitors and successors==\nUpon its introduction, the Lebel rifle proved to be vastly superior to the [[Mauser Model 1871|Mauser M-71/84]], the German Army's replacement of the Model 1869 Werder. France finished its rearmament program with the Lebel in 1889, just 18 months after Germany had completed its rifle replacement program with 780,000 M-71/84s. The new French rifle alarmed Bismarck. Tests at [[Spandau arsenal]] in the winter of 1887-1888 found that the Lebel could fire 43 rounds of smokeless powder ammunition per minute compared to just 26 of black-powder ammunition for the M-71/84. The inferiority of the Mauser M71/84 and its 11mm black-powder ammunition was one reason why Bismarck opposed going to war with France that winter, despite being pressed by War Minister [[Waldersee]] (another reason was that the new French [[De Bange]] field artillery, now equipped with breech loaders after the lessons of the 1870 war, both outnumbered and outperformed the [[Krupp]] [[C64 (field gun)|C64]] field guns in their rate of fire).<ref name=\"Brose2004\">{{cite book|author=Eric Dorn Brose|title=The Kaiser's Army: The Politics of Military Technology in Germany During the Machine Age, 1870-1918|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517945-3|pages=47\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe Mle 1886 rifle proved to be a sturdy and serviceable weapon, but one which became rapidly outdated by advances in military rifle and ammunition designs. As early as 1888, the German Army\u2019s Rifle Testing Commission had introduced in response a completely new turnbolt magazine rifle with a spring-loaded box magazine: the [[Gewehr 88]] \"commission\" rifle. Above all else, it had been designed around the first ever rimless military cartridge using the new smokeless powder ammunition: the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]] cartridge. The early Gewehr 88 was followed 10 years later by the highly successful [[Gewehr 98]] [[Mauser rifle]] which still fired the same cartridge but with ballistic improvements.\n\nIn response to being left behind by Germany's Mauser rifle, the French military decided in 1909 to replace the Lebel and its rimmed cartridge by more advanced designs. Consequently, while the bolt action [[Berthier rifle]] was first issued in 1907 as a stop-gap to arm colonial troops, the French defense ministry was planning to leapfrog other military forces with an advanced semi-automatic infantry rifle. This new weapon was the [[Meunier rifle]], also known as the '''Fusil A6''', which chambered a more powerful 7\u00d759mm rimless cartridge. It was adopted in 1912 after an extensive competitive process. However, its manufacture, which was to begin in 1913, was suspended because of the imminent risk of war with Germany. Instead, and during World War I, the French Army chose the easier and less expensive solution of adopting a gas-operated [[semi-automatic rifle]] which incorporated some Lebel parts: the Fusil '''[[Fusil Automatique Modele 1917|Mle 1917 RSC]]''', once again in 8mm Lebel caliber. It was manufactured in large numbers (85,000) during 1918 and issued to select soldiers in infantry regiments. However, the Mle 1917 RSC was criticized by infantrymen as being too heavy, too long, and too difficult to maintain in the trenches. Furthermore, it also needed a special five-round clip to operate. In the end, the aged M1886 Lebel and variants of the Berthier rifle remained in service until the Armistice of November 11, 1918 and beyond.\n\n==8mm Lebel cartridge==\nWhen it first appeared, the Lebel's [[8mm Lebel|8\u00d750R]] smokeless ammunition allied to its longer range and flatter trajectory brought a revolution in infantry armament. A soldier equipped with a Lebel could outrange troops carrying rifles chambered for black-powder, large-caliber lead-bullet ammunition. Using smokeless powder, he could remain virtually invisible to an enemy at longer ranges, yet locate an enemy at any range by the smoke from their rifles. He could also carry more cartridges for the same overall weight.<ref name=nra/>\n\nA new 197 gr (12.8 g) solid [[brass]] (90% copper-10% zinc) pointed (spitzer) and boat-tail bullet (\"''Balle D''\")\u2014historically the very first boat-tailed plus spitzer rifle bullet to be invented and then widely manufactured\u2014was adopted for the Lebel rifle in 1898 and placed in generalized service after 1901. Desaleux's own ''Balle D'' provided a flatter trajectory and increased the range of the Mle 1886 rifle to about 4,000 yards and its maximum effective wounding distance (when fired indirectly at massed area targets) to 1,800 yards. More importantly, due to the bullet's flatter trajectory, the realistic effective range of the 8mm Lebel was increased to approximately {{convert|457|yd|m}} using open sights. The altered ballistic trajectory of the new cartridge necessitated a replacement of the Lebel's rear sights.<ref name=nra/>\n\nFirstly, in order to avoid accidental percussion inside the Lebel tube magazine and in order to receive the pointed bullet tip of the cartridge that followed, all the French-manufactured military ''Balle D'' and ''Balle N'' ammunition had a circular groove etched around each primer pocket.  Moreover, the [[Berdan rifle|Berdan]] primer on each French-made military ''Balle D'' round was further protected  against accidental percussion by a thick, [[wikt:convex|convex]] primer cover which was crimped in after 1915, the \"Balle D a.m.\"{{sfn|Huon|1988|p={{page needed|date=July 2019}}}}\n\nThe last type of Lebel military issue ammunition to be introduced was the Cartouche Mle 1932N, using a cupro-nickel, silver-colored, jacketed spitzer boat-tailed lead-cored bullet which was only suitable for Lebel and Berthier rifles marked \"N\" on top of the receiver and barrel. This 8mm Lebel heavier Balle \"N\" ammunition had originally been designed to increase the range of the [[Hotchkiss machine gun]]. Its manufacturing ceased in France during the late 1960s.\n\n8mm Lebel ammunition was powerful for its time. It ranked slightly higher in muzzle energy than .303 British and slightly lower than the German 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser cartridge. The chief negative characteristic of 8mm Lebel ammunition was the geometry of its rimmed bottlenecked case, due to the will to reuse 11mm Gras case set of tools. This adversely affected the magazine capacity and functioning of firearms, particularly in automatic weapons such as the [[Chauchat]] machine rifle. The Lebel cartridge's heavily tapered case shape and substantial rim forced weapon designers to resort to magazines with extreme curvatures as for the Chauchat machine rifle. In contrast, rimless straight-wall cartridges such as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the 8\u00d757mm Mauser could easily be loaded in straight vertical magazines.<ref name=nra/>\n\n==M1886 in service==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Lebel rifle by the French Army, most other nations switched to small-bore infantry rifles using smokeless ammunition. [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]] adopted new 8mm infantry rifles in 1888; [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1891; and the U.S. in 1892 with the [[Krag]] rifle. The [[British Empire|British]] upgraded their .303 [[Lee\u2013Metford]] with smokeless cartridges in 1895, resulting in the .303 [[Lee\u2013Enfield]].\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the Lebel rifle was sold in the French overseas colonies for the protection of civilians or for hunting purposes.{{cn|date=July 2019}} Brand new Lebels could be purchased by authorized civilians{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=30}}{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=31}} and were featured in catalogs of the French mail-order firm [[Manufrance]] printed until 1939.{{cn|date=July 2019}} Those \"civilian market\" Lebels sold by Manufrance were strictly identical in fit and finish to the military issue Lebels,  except for the lack of a bayonet lug and no stacking rod.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=31}} Furthermore, a large game hunting version of the Lebel called the \"Lebel-Africain\" was also offered for sale by Manufrance during the pre-World War II years. This particular version featured a shorter barrel, a turned-down bolt handle and a slimmer, better finished stock. However, it had to compete as a hunting weapon against the bolt-action Mauser and [[Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer]] hunting rifles that became available on the French marketplace, in the early 1900s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===World War I usage===\nThe Lebel rifle was a hard-hitting and solidly built weapon with a reputation for reliability in adverse environments including those of trench warfare.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Lebel rifle was quite accurate up to 300 yards and still deadly at three times that distance, thanks to the spitzer and boat tail \"Balle D\" bullet. Nevertheless, the Lebel rifle was not without its flaws:\n* The slow-to-reload tube magazine was the Lebel's worst handicap when compared to other military rifles of that period.\n* The Lebel's diminutive sights, while accurate, were low and small thus not easy to align and unprotected against shocks.\n* The lack of a wooden handguard on top of the barrel led to burned hands after prolonged firings.\n\nNevertheless, the Lebel rifle was preferred by French infantrymen over the M1907-15 Berthier rifle with its limited three-round magazine capacity. The difference was the Lebel's larger magazine capacity in an emergency (eight rounds plus two extra rounds). In the words of David Fortier (in \"Standard Catalog of Military Rifles\", 2003):  \"The rifle shoulders nicely and is comfortable with a 13.5\" length of pull. Align the hard to see sights and squeeze. When the hammer drops the Lebel slaps hard on both ends. The bolt handle is a bit out of reach due to its forward placement, but the action is fairly smooth and easy to run from the shoulder. You just have to give it a bit of a tug at the end to snap the shell carrier up&nbsp;... With quality ammunition and a good bore these rifles are capable of fine accuracy.&nbsp;... A rugged and reliable design, the Lebel soldiered on far longer than it should have.\"\n\nDuring World War I (1914\u20131918), the Lebel remained the standard rifle of French infantry whereas the Berthier rifle\u2014a lengthened version of the [[Berthier carbine]]\u2014featuring a Mannlicher-style 3-round magazine was issued to colonial troops, to allied contingents in the French Army, and to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. The latter, however, demanded and obtained in 1920 being re-equipped with the Lebel rifle. The Lebel rifle could also be used with a removable VB (Viven-Bessieres) [[rifle grenade]] launcher. While the Lebel rifle was quite effective up to 300 meters with the standard ''Balle D'' boat-tail bullet ammunition, accuracy at longer distances was impaired by the existing open sights. Consequently, the APX Mle 1916 and APX Mle 1917 models of the Lebel rifle with adjustable telescopic sights were issued in numbers during WW-1, beginning in late 1916.<ref name=nra/>\n\nDuring World War I, Lebels were supplied to various [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] armies, such as [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]],<ref name=\"Balkans\">{{cite book|title=Armies in the Balkans 1914\u201318|series=Men-at-Arms 356|first1=Nigel|last1= Thomas|first2= Dusan|last2= Babac|date= 25 Jul 2001|isbn=9781841761947|pages=12,33|publisher=Osprey Publishing}}</ref> [[Belgium]]<ref name=\"Belgium\">{{cite  book|title= The Belgian Army in World War I|series=Men-at-Arms 452|first1=Ronald |last1=Pawly|first2= Pierre|last2= Lierneux |date=10 Jun 2009|isbn=9781846034480|page=42|publisher=Osprey Publishing}}</ref> or [[United States]].<ref name=USA/>\n\nThe [[German Empire]] captured many Lebels, especially after the fall of Lille during the [[Race to the Sea]]. The rifles were marked ''Deutsches Reich'' and issued to rear units.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=31}}\n\n===Post-World War I use===\nBecause of negative factors during the late 1920s and 1930s\u2014a depressed economy, reduced war budgets under the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] led by [[Leon Blum]], and neglect at high military levels, notably by then war minister, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]\u2014the French Army was slow to modernize its infantry weapons. For instance, production of the bolt-action [[MAS-36]] rifle began much too late (in 1937) although its prototype had already been approved in 1929. As a result, MAS-36 rifles to equip French infantry were in short supply when World War II broke out in September 1939. Furthermore, a thoroughly tested French semi-automatic rifle was also ready to be placed into production by 1939. But due to the German occupation of France during the Second World War, five more years had to pass before this gas-operated weapon (the MAS-1939 and MAS-40) could be issued as the MAS-44, [[MAS-49]] and MAS 1949-56  series.{{sfn|Gander|2000|p=50}} Another adverse result of all these delays is that Lebel rifles\u2014many of which had since been shortened into a carbine-length version, the Mle 1886 M93R35\u2014were still in the hands of front-line and reserve troops at the outbreak of the war.

It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine, one round in the transporter plus one round in the chamber. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use [[smokeless powder]] ammunition. The new propellant powder, \"''[[Poudre B]]'',\" was [[nitrocellulose]]-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist [[Paul Vieille]].  Lieutenant Colonel [[Nicolas Lebel]] contributed a flat nosed 8&nbsp;mm [[full metal jacket bullet]] (\"''Balle M'',\" or \"''Balle Lebel''\"). Twelve years later, in 1898, a solid [[brass]] pointed ([[spitzer (bullet)|spitzer]]) and [[boat-tail bullet]] called \"''Balle D''\" was retained for all 8mm Lebel ammunition.  Each case was protected against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a primer cover and by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of [[8mm Lebel]] rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French infantry during World War I (1914\u20131918). Altogether, 3.45 million Lebel rifles were produced by the three French state factories between 1887 and 1916.<ref name=nra>{{harvnb|James|2014|pp=67\u201371&108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\n==Operation, features, and accessories==\nIn operation, the bolt is turned up to the vertical position until the two opposed front locking lugs are released from the receiver. At the end of the bolt's opening phase, a ramp on the receiver bridge forces the bolt to the rear thus providing leveraged extraction of the fired case. The rifle is fitted with a two-piece wood stock, and features a spring-loaded tubular magazine in the fore-end. Taking aim at intermediate distances is done with a ramp sight graduated between 400 and 800 meters. The ladder rear sight is adjustable from 850 to 2,400 meters. Flipping forward that ladder sight reveals the commonly used fixed combat sight up to 400 meters.<ref name=nra/> The Mle 1886 rifle has a 10-round capacity (eight in the under barrel tube magazine, one in the transporter, and one in the chamber). The Lebel rifle features a magazine cutoff on the right side of the receiver. When activated it prevents feeding cartridges from the magazine.<ref name=nra/>\n\nThe Mle 1886 Lebel rifle was issued with a long needle-like quadrangular [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]] [[bayonet]], the ''\u00c9p\u00e9e-Ba\u00efonnette Mod\u00e8le 1886'', with a length of 52&nbsp;cm. (20 in.). With its X-shaped cross section, the \u00e9p\u00e9e bayonet was optimized for thrusting, designed to readily penetrate thick clothing and leather. The bayonet was dubbed \"Rosalie\" by French soldiers who were issued it during World War I.<ref name=nra/>\n\n==Origins and development==\nHistorically, the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle was the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition.  This new  propellant powder,  made of stabilized nitrocellulose, was called \"''Poudre B''\" (\"Powder B\") and had just been invented in 1884 by [[Paul Vieille]] (1854-1934).  ''Poudre B'' was  three times as powerful as [[black powder]], for the same weight, and left virtually no residues of combustion.<ref name=nra/> For this last reason, the new powder enabled the reduction of the caliber. The increase of the bullet speed in the barrel required a stronger bullet than the older lead bullet. New cartridges were designed where the lead was placed in deformable metal.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=26}}\n\nShortly thereafter, in January 1886, the French war minister, General [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], requested the urgent application of these two technical breakthroughs to the design of a new infantry rifle.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=27}} He appointed General Tramond in charge of the project which had to be completed within one year. Firstly the 11mm Gras cartridge case was redesigned into an 8mm case, a transformation carried out by Gras and Lt. Colonel Desaleux. The repeating mechanism,  derived from the French Mle 1884 Gras-Kropatschek repeating rifle, was implemented by Albert Close and Louis Verdin at the Chatellerault arsenal. The bolt's two opposed front locking lugs, inspired from the two rear locking  lugs on the bolt of the earlier Swiss [[Vetterli rifle]], were designed by Colonel Bonnet. The  8mm flat nosed FMJ \"''Balle M''\" bullet was suggested by Tramond and designed by [[lieutenant-colonel|Lt. Colonel]] [[Nicolas Lebel]] after whom the rifle (and the caliber) are named. However, Lebel did not lead the team responsible for creating the new rifle. He amicably protested during his lifetime that Tramond and Gras were the two superior officers who jointly deserved that credit. Nevertheless, his name, which only designated the ''Balle M'' bullet as the \"''Balle Lebel'',\" informally stuck to the entire weapon.<ref name=nra/>\n\n[[File:Lebel 8mm round.jpg|thumb|left|The [[8mm Lebel]] ammunition, developed in 1886, the first [[smokeless powder]] cartridge to be made and adopted by any country. This round features the solid brass boat-tailed \"Balle D\" bullet introduced in 1901.]]\nThe Lebel followed the [[bolt action]] '''11mm Mle 1874''' [[Gras rifle|Gras]] and the '''Mle 1878''' French naval [[Kropatschek]] rifle designed by an Austrian, [[Alfred von Kropatschek]], and shared the latter's tubular magazine in the fore-end. Two transitional repeating infantry bolt-action rifles, still chambered for the 11mm Gras black-powder cartridge, followed the '''Mle 1878''' rifle: the '''Mle 1884''' and the '''Mle 1885''' rifles. The latter had a two-piece stock and a massive steel receiver and closely resembles the''' Mle 1886''' Lebel.<ref name=nra/>\n\nIn 1893, an improved version of the M1886 Lebel was designated '''Fusil Mle 1886 M (modifi\u00e9) 93'''. The most useful improvement was a modification of the bolt head so it would divert away from the shooter's face any hot gases escaping from a ruptured cartridge case. The firing pin and its rear knob had already been modified in 1887 while the stacking rod remained unchanged.<ref name=nra/> Lastly, the fixation of the rear sight onto the barrel was substantially improved during that 1893 modification.{{sfn|Lombard|1987|p={{page needed|date=July 2019}}}}\n\n[[File:Lebel breech portion.jpg|thumb|Lebel rifle breech portion]]\n[[File:Rifles1905-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Schematic image Nos. 3 and 4]]\nThe Lebel rifle was manufactured by three government arsenals: Ch\u00e2tellerault, St-Etienne and Tulle. It featured a two-piece stock and a massive receiver designed to withstand the higher pressures developed by the new smokeless powder-based cartridges. Between 1935 and 1940, a carbine-length (17.7&nbsp;inch barrel) version of the Lebel was issued to mounted colonial troops in North Africa. This short carbine version of the Lebel, called the '''Mle 1886 M93-R35''', was assembled in large numbers (about 50,000) at Manufacture d'Armes de Tulle (MAT), beginning in 1935. It used all of the Lebel's parts except for a newly manufactured shorter barrel of carbine length.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}Since the new carbine's tube magazine had to be shortened  as well, its magazine capacity was only three rounds.\n\nThe Lebel rifle design was not without any short comings. While ammunition had to be loaded into the design one at a time, other country's service rifles were being loaded with stripper clips at a much faster rate. The tube fed magazine also greatly affected the rifle's balance when being fired which could have been another short coming.<ref>Mike Searson (20 June 2018), Breach Bang Clear, https://www.breachbangclear.com/the-1886-lebel/</ref>\n\n==Competitors and successors==\nUpon its introduction, the Lebel rifle proved to be vastly superior to the [[Mauser Model 1871|Mauser M-71/84]], the German Army's replacement of the Model 1869 Werder. France finished its rearmament program with the Lebel in 1889, just 18 months after Germany had completed its rifle replacement program with 780,000 M-71/84s. The new French rifle alarmed Bismarck. Tests at [[Spandau arsenal]] in the winter of 1887-1888 found that the Lebel could fire 43 rounds of smokeless powder ammunition per minute compared to just 26 of black-powder ammunition for the M-71/84. The inferiority of the Mauser M71/84 and its 11mm black-powder ammunition was one reason why Bismarck opposed going to war with France that winter, despite being pressed by War Minister [[Waldersee]] (another reason was that the new French [[De Bange]] field artillery, now equipped with breech loaders after the lessons of the 1870 war, both outnumbered and outperformed the [[Krupp]] [[C64 (field gun)|C64]] field guns in their rate of fire).<ref name=\"Brose2004\">{{cite book|author=Eric Dorn Brose|title=The Kaiser's Army: The Politics of Military Technology in Germany During the Machine Age, 1870-1918|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517945-3|pages=47\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe Mle 1886 rifle proved to be a sturdy and serviceable weapon, but one which became rapidly outdated by advances in military rifle and ammunition designs. As early as 1888, the German Army\u2019s Rifle Testing Commission had introduced in response a completely new turnbolt magazine rifle with a spring-loaded box magazine: the [[Gewehr 88]] \"commission\" rifle. Above all else, it had been designed around the first ever rimless military cartridge using the new smokeless powder ammunition: the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]] cartridge. The early Gewehr 88 was followed 10 years later by the highly successful [[Gewehr 98]] [[Mauser rifle]] which still fired the same cartridge but with ballistic improvements.\n\nIn response to being left behind by Germany's Mauser rifle, the French military decided in 1909 to replace the Lebel and its rimmed cartridge by more advanced designs. Consequently, while the bolt action [[Berthier rifle]] was first issued in 1907 as a stop-gap to arm colonial troops, the French defense ministry was planning to leapfrog other military forces with an advanced semi-automatic infantry rifle. This new weapon was the [[Meunier rifle]], also known as the '''Fusil A6''', which chambered a more powerful 7\u00d759mm rimless cartridge. It was adopted in 1912 after an extensive competitive process. However, its manufacture, which was to begin in 1913, was suspended because of the imminent risk of war with Germany. Instead, and during World War I, the French Army chose the easier and less expensive solution of adopting a gas-operated [[semi-automatic rifle]] which incorporated some Lebel parts: the Fusil '''[[Fusil Automatique Modele 1917|Mle 1917 RSC]]''', once again in 8mm Lebel caliber. It was manufactured in large numbers (85,000) during 1918 and issued to select soldiers in infantry regiments. However, the Mle 1917 RSC was criticized by infantrymen as being too heavy, too long, and too difficult to maintain in the trenches. Furthermore, it also needed a special five-round clip to operate. In the end, the aged M1886 Lebel and variants of the Berthier rifle remained in service until the Armistice of November 11, 1918 and beyond.\n\n==8mm Lebel cartridge==\nWhen it first appeared, the Lebel's [[8mm Lebel|8\u00d750R]] smokeless ammunition allied to its longer range and flatter trajectory brought a revolution in infantry armament. A soldier equipped with a Lebel could outrange troops carrying rifles chambered for black-powder, large-caliber lead-bullet ammunition. Using smokeless powder, he could remain virtually invisible to an enemy at longer ranges, yet locate an enemy at any range by the smoke from their rifles. He could also carry more cartridges for the same overall weight.<ref name=nra/>\n\nA new 197 gr (12.8 g) solid [[brass]] (90% copper-10% zinc) pointed (spitzer) and boat-tail bullet (\"''Balle D''\")\u2014historically the very first boat-tailed plus spitzer rifle bullet to be invented and then widely manufactured\u2014was adopted for the Lebel rifle in 1898 and placed in generalized service after 1901. Desaleux's own ''Balle D'' provided a flatter trajectory and increased the range of the Mle 1886 rifle to about 4,000 yards and its maximum effective wounding distance (when fired indirectly at massed area targets) to 1,800 yards. More importantly, due to the bullet's flatter trajectory, the realistic effective range of the 8mm Lebel was increased to approximately {{convert|457|yd|m}} using open sights. The altered ballistic trajectory of the new cartridge necessitated a replacement of the Lebel's rear sights.<ref name=nra/>\n\nFirstly, in order to avoid accidental percussion inside the Lebel tube magazine and in order to receive the pointed bullet tip of the cartridge that followed, all the French-manufactured military ''Balle D'' and ''Balle N'' ammunition had a circular groove etched around each primer pocket.  Moreover, the [[Berdan rifle|Berdan]] primer on each French-made military ''Balle D'' round was further protected  against accidental percussion by a thick, [[wikt:convex|convex]] primer cover which was crimped in after 1915, the \"Balle D a.m.\"{{sfn|Huon|1988|p={{page needed|date=July 2019}}}}\n\nThe last type of Lebel military issue ammunition to be introduced was the Cartouche Mle 1932N, using a cupro-nickel, silver-colored, jacketed spitzer boat-tailed lead-cored bullet which was only suitable for Lebel and Berthier rifles marked \"N\" on top of the receiver and barrel. This 8mm Lebel heavier Balle \"N\" ammunition had originally been designed to increase the range of the [[Hotchkiss machine gun]]. Its manufacturing ceased in France during the late 1960s.\n\n8mm Lebel ammunition was powerful for its time. It ranked slightly higher in muzzle energy than .303 British and slightly lower than the German 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser cartridge. The chief negative characteristic of 8mm Lebel ammunition was the geometry of its rimmed bottlenecked case, due to the will to reuse 11mm Gras case set of tools. This adversely affected the magazine capacity and functioning of firearms, particularly in automatic weapons such as the [[Chauchat]] machine rifle. The Lebel cartridge's heavily tapered case shape and substantial rim forced weapon designers to resort to magazines with extreme curvatures as for the Chauchat machine rifle. In contrast, rimless straight-wall cartridges such as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the 8\u00d757mm Mauser could easily be loaded in straight vertical magazines.<ref name=nra/>\n\n==M1886 in service==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Lebel rifle by the French Army, most other nations switched to small-bore infantry rifles using smokeless ammunition. [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]] adopted new 8mm infantry rifles in 1888; [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1891; and the U.S. in 1892 with the [[Krag]] rifle. The [[British Empire|British]] upgraded their .303 [[Lee\u2013Metford]] with smokeless cartridges in 1895, resulting in the .303 [[Lee\u2013Enfield]].\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the Lebel rifle was sold in the French overseas colonies for the protection of civilians or for hunting purposes.{{cn|date=July 2019}} Brand new Lebels could be purchased by authorized civilians{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=30}}{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=31}} and were featured in catalogs of the French mail-order firm [[Manufrance]] printed until 1939.{{cn|date=July 2019}} Those \"civilian market\" Lebels sold by Manufrance were strictly identical in fit and finish to the military issue Lebels,  except for the lack of a bayonet lug and no stacking rod.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=31}} Furthermore, a large game hunting version of the Lebel called the \"Lebel-Africain\" was also offered for sale by Manufrance during the pre-World War II years. This particular version featured a shorter barrel, a turned-down bolt handle and a slimmer, better finished stock. However, it had to compete as a hunting weapon against the bolt-action Mauser and [[Mannlicher\u2013Sch\u00f6nauer]] hunting rifles that became available on the French marketplace, in the early 1900s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===World War I usage===\nThe Lebel rifle was a hard-hitting and solidly built weapon with a reputation for reliability in adverse environments including those of trench warfare.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Lebel rifle was quite accurate up to 300 yards and still deadly at three times that distance, thanks to the spitzer and boat tail \"Balle D\" bullet. Nevertheless, the Lebel rifle was not without its flaws:\n* The slow-to-reload tube magazine was the Lebel's worst handicap when compared to other military rifles of that period.\n* The Lebel's diminutive sights, while accurate, were low and small thus not easy to align and unprotected against shocks.\n* The lack of a wooden handguard on top of the barrel led to burned hands after prolonged firings.\n\nNevertheless, the Lebel rifle was preferred by French infantrymen over the M1907-15 Berthier rifle with its limited three-round magazine capacity. The difference was the Lebel's larger magazine capacity in an emergency (eight rounds plus two extra rounds). In the words of David Fortier (in \"Standard Catalog of Military Rifles\", 2003):  \"The rifle shoulders nicely and is comfortable with a 13.5\" length of pull. Align the hard to see sights and squeeze. When the hammer drops the Lebel slaps hard on both ends. The bolt handle is a bit out of reach due to its forward placement, but the action is fairly smooth and easy to run from the shoulder. You just have to give it a bit of a tug at the end to snap the shell carrier up&nbsp;... With quality ammunition and a good bore these rifles are capable of fine accuracy.&nbsp;... A rugged and reliable design, the Lebel soldiered on far longer than it should have.\"\n\nDuring World War I (1914\u20131918), the Lebel remained the standard rifle of French infantry whereas the Berthier rifle\u2014a lengthened version of the [[Berthier carbine]]\u2014featuring a Mannlicher-style 3-round magazine was issued to colonial troops, to allied contingents in the French Army, and to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. The latter, however, demanded and obtained in 1920 being re-equipped with the Lebel rifle. The Lebel rifle could also be used with a removable VB (Viven-Bessieres) [[rifle grenade]] launcher. While the Lebel rifle was quite effective up to 300 meters with the standard ''Balle D'' boat-tail bullet ammunition, accuracy at longer distances was impaired by the existing open sights. Consequently, the APX Mle 1916 and APX Mle 1917 models of the Lebel rifle with adjustable telescopic sights were issued in numbers during WW-1, beginning in late 1916.<ref name=nra/>\n\nDuring World War I, Lebels were supplied to various [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] armies, such as [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]],<ref name=\"Balkans\">{{cite book|title=Armies in the Balkans 1914\u201318|series=Men-at-Arms 356|first1=Nigel|last1= Thomas|first2= Dusan|last2= Babac|date= 25 Jul 2001|isbn=9781841761947|pages=12,33|publisher=Osprey Publishing}}</ref> [[Belgium]]<ref name=\"Belgium\">{{cite  book|title= The Belgian Army in World War I|series=Men-at-Arms 452|first1=Ronald |last1=Pawly|first2= Pierre|last2= Lierneux |date=10 Jun 2009|isbn=9781846034480|page=42|publisher=Osprey Publishing}}</ref> or [[United States]].<ref name=USA/>\n\nThe [[German Empire]] captured many Lebels, especially after the fall of Lille during the [[Race to the Sea]]. The rifles were marked ''Deutsches Reich'' and issued to rear units.{{sfn|Guillou|2012|p=31}}\n\n===Post-World War I use===\nBecause of negative factors during the late 1920s and 1930s\u2014a depressed economy, reduced war budgets under the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] led by [[Leon Blum]], and neglect at high military levels, notably by then war minister, Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]\u2014the French Army was slow to modernize its infantry weapons. For instance, production of the bolt-action [[MAS-36]] rifle began much too late (in 1937) although its prototype had already been approved in 1929. As a result, MAS-36 rifles to equip French infantry were in short supply when World War II broke out in September 1939. Furthermore, a thoroughly tested French semi-automatic rifle was also ready to be placed into production by 1939. But due to the German occupation of France during the Second World War, five more years had to pass before this gas-operated weapon (the MAS-1939 and MAS-40) could be issued as the MAS-44, [[MAS-49]] and MAS 1949-56  series.{{sfn|Gander|2000|p=50}} Another adverse result of all these delays is that Lebel rifles\u2014many of which had since been shortened into a carbine-length version, the Mle 1886 M93R35\u2014were still in the hands of front-line and reserve troops at the outbreak of the war.

limit}}\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Deaf videoconference.jpg|thumb|A deaf person using a camera-equipped smartphone to communicate in sign language.]]\n*Hearing loss exists when there is diminished acuity to sounds normally heard.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.\n*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.\n*[[Speech perception]] \u2013 Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech discrimination. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech discrimination alone.  One example is [[auditory neuropathy]], a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the auditory nerve and brain properly.<ref name=\"eBook1\">eBook: ''Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery'', Lalwani, Anil K.

Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90&nbsp;dB and 115&nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.<ref>ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age</ref><ref>ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n*difficulty using the [[telephone]]\n*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]\n*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]].\n*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])\n*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated\n*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources\n\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\n*pain or pressure in the ears\n*a blocked feeling\n\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\n*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as \"[[auditory recruitment]]\"\n*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present\n*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium\n*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals\n*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with [[Bell's palsy|Bell's Palsy]]\n\n=== Complications ===\nHearing loss is associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]].

As noise damage progresses, damage spreads to affect lower and higher frequencies. On an [[audiogram]], the resulting configuration has a distinctive notch, called a 'noise' notch. As ageing and other effects contribute to higher frequency loss (6\u20138&nbsp;kHz on an audiogram), this notch may be obscured and entirely disappear.\n\nVarious governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards.<ref>In the United States, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]], and numerous state government agencies among others, set noise standards.</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has identified the level of 70&nbsp;dB(A) (40% louder to twice as loud as normal conversation; typical level of TV, radio, stereo; city street noise) for 24\u2011hour exposure as the level necessary to protect the public from hearing loss and other disruptive effects from noise, such as sleep disturbance, stress-related problems, learning detriment, etc.<ref>Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety.

Estimation of a \"safe\" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&nbsp;dB. As 3&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the \"safe\" daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the \"safe\" exposure at 91&nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.<ref>Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126</ref>\nDifferent standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.\n\nSome national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&nbsp;dB or 5&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B \u2013 GLOSSARY OF TERMS| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archive-date=2013-11-12| access-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.\n\nMany people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.\n\nIn the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.<ref name=\"kid\">{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archive-date=2009-12-21}}</ref>  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.<ref name=WHO2015Aud/>\n\nHearing loss due to noise has been described as primarily a condition of modern society.<ref name=Go2007>{{cite journal| last1=Goines| first1=Lisa| last2=Hagler| first2=Louis| name-list-format = vanc | title=Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague| journal=Southern Medical Journal| date=March 2007| volume=100| issue=3| pages=287\u2013294 | citeseerx=10.1.1.504.8717| doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3180318be5| pmid=17396733}}</ref> In preindustrial times, humans had far less exposure to loud sounds.

Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual. This accounts for around 30% of deaf individuals who are deaf from a genetic standpoint.<ref name=Harvard /> Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with an individual other than deafness. From a genetic standpoint, this accounts for the other 70% of cases, and represents the majority of hereditary hearing loss.<ref name=Harvard /> Syndromic cases occur with disorders such as [[Usher syndrome]], [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]], [[Alport's syndrome]], and [[neurofibromatosis type 2]].

Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or [[otorhinolaryngologist]].\n\n===Case history===\nA case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ.

Hearing sensitivity varies according to the [[frequency]] of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an [[audiogram]].\n\nOther method for quantifying hearing loss is a [[hearing test]] using a mobile application or [[hearing aid application]], which includes a [[hearing test]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shojaeemend H, Ayatollahi H | title = Automated Audiometry: A Review of the Implementation and Evaluation Methods | journal = Healthcare Informatics Research | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 263\u2013275 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30443414 | pmc = 6230538 | doi = 10.4258/hir.2018.24.4.263 }}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keidser G, Convery E | title = Self-Fitting Hearing Aids: Status Quo and Future Predictions | journal = Trends in Hearing | volume = 20 | pages = 233121651664328 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27072929 | pmc = 4871211 | doi = 10.1177/2331216516643284 }}</ref> Hearing diagnosis using mobile application is similar to the [[audiometry]] procedure.

As the name implies, a speech-in-noise test gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. A person with a hearing loss will often be less able to understand speech, especially in noisy conditions. This is especially true for people who have a sensorineural loss \u2013 which is by far the most common type of hearing loss. As such, speech-in-noise tests can provide valuable information about a person's hearing ability, and can be used to detect the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss. A recently developed digit-triple speech-in-noise test may be a more efficient screening test.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen S, Luts H, Dejonckere P, van Wieringen A, Wouters J | title = Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 773\u20138 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23782715 | doi = 10.1097/AUD.0b013e318297920b | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/398543/2/Jansen_Ear%26Hearing_2013.pdf }}</ref>\n\nOtoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.\n\nAuditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.\n\n===Scans===\n{{contradictory|date=August 2019}}\nMRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Classification===\nHearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.\n\n====Severity====\nThe severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&nbsp;Hz, 1000&nbsp;Hz, 2000&nbsp;Hz and 4000&nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.\n\nHearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* Slight: between 16 and 25&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild:\n** for adults: between 26 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n** for children: between 20 and 40&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderate: between 41 and 54&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Severe: between 71 and 90&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Profound: 91&nbsp;dB HL or greater<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.\n\nThe 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|access-date=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n* Moderate hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&nbsp;dB HL\n* Severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&nbsp;dB HL\n* Very severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&nbsp;dB HL\n** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&nbsp;dB HL\n* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&nbsp;dB HL\n\nHearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.\n\nFor certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized \"percentage of hearing loss\", which is suitable for legal purposes only.\n\n====Type====\nThere are three main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses are called a mixed hearing loss.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.\n\n*Conductive hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.\n\nDysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] \u2013 malleus, incus, and stapes \u2013 may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.\n\n*Sensorineural hearing loss\nSensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.<ref name=\"RussellPineYoung2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL | title = Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 841\u201363 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23905823 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 }}</ref>\n\n*Central deafness\nDamage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.\n\n*Mixed hearing loss\nMixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.\n\n*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]\n\nThis is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.\n\n====Configuration====\nThe shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.\nThere are four general configurations of hearing loss:\n\n1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.\n\n2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.\n\n3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.\n\n4. Trough-shaped (\"cookie-bite\" or \"U\" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.\n\n====Unilateral and bilateral====\nPeople with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:\n\n*hearing conversation on their impaired side\n*localizing sound\n*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.\n\nIn quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.\n\nOne reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]].

For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nMany in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as [[sign language]] or [[total communication]]. Many deaf people view cochlear implants and other hearing devices as confusing to one's identity. They feel a deaf person will never be a hearing person and therefore would be trying to fit into a way of living that is not their own. Other concerns include loss of [[deaf culture]] and identity and limitations on hearing restoration.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nJack Gannon, a professor at [[Gallaudet University]], said this about [[Deaf culture]]: \"Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences.\" Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, \"[deaf people] tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa... our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies.\"<ref>Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981)</ref> Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the \"pathological view of the deaf.\"<ref name=pathological>{{cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|access-date=14 May 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522030209/http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|archive-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers. Bill Vicars expresses the power of this bond when stating, \"if given the chance to become hearing most [deaf people] would choose to remain deaf.\"<ref name=\"deafcultureonline\">{{cite web | last=Drolsbaugh | first=Mark | name-list-format = vanc | title=Everything You've Wanted to Know About Deaf Culture (And Then Some) | url=http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | publisher=Deaf Culture Online | access-date=2011-11-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213211737/http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | archive-date=2011-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe United States-based [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] has a statement on its website regarding cochlear implants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=NAD Cochlear Implant Committee|title=NAD Position Statement on Cochlear Implants (2000)|url=http://nad.org/issues/technology/assistive-listening/cochlear-implants|website=Cochlear Implants %7c National Association of the Deaf|publisher=National Association of the Deaf|access-date=30 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205174005/http://nad.org/issues/technology/assistive-listening/cochlear-implants|archive-date=5 December 2014}}</ref> The NAD asserts that the choice to implant is up to the individual (or the parents), yet strongly advocates a fully informed decision in all aspects of a cochlear implant. Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be \"cured,\" while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.\n\nMany other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.\n\n==Sign language==\n{{Main|Sign language}}\n[[File:Drawing (sign language friend), 2008.jpg|thumb|The sign language for \"friend\".]]\nSign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. \"Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information\".<ref>{{cite web|title=American Sign Language|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|website=NIDCD|access-date=17 November 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115163913/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|archive-date=15 November 2016|date=2015-08-18}}</ref>\n\n===Government policies===\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:Texas School for the Deaf main gate.jpg|thumb|[[Texas School for the Deaf]]]]\nThose who are deaf (by either state or federal standards) have access to a free and appropriate public education.

An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.<ref name=\"SmithDD2010\" />\n\n====Family====\nThe communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.<ref name=\"FOSTER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Foster S | date = 1996 | chapter = Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. | veditors = Parasnis I | title = Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience | pages = 117\u2013136 | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Community====\n[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]\nPeople who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual's social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and \"messing around\" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nMany people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.\n\nThere are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act \"as if\" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life's meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one's inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one's communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.<ref name=\"SCHERER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Scherer MJ | date = 2004 | chapter = The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. | title = Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities | pages = 41\u201355 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Psychological Association }}</ref>\n\n====Workplace====\nIn most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person's career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nTo avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures<ref>Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.</ref> By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.\n\n====Health care====\nNot only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual's physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis.<ref name=\"Medicina\">Medicina Oral, Patolog\u00eda Oral y Cirug\u00eda Bucal. (2007, January 1).

Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual's severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.<ref name=\"Medicina\" /> Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.\n\nAlthough there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional's insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication.\nActs in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional's verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.<ref>Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter. Retrieved November 2, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |title=The Role of the Deaf Interpreter |access-date=2014-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141105190523/http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |archive-date=2014-11-05 }}</ref> They accompany a sign language interpreter and are useful for communication with deaf individuals who also have language or cognitive deficits. A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.<ref>Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., & Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.</ref>\n\nAside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient's needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.<ref name=\"Medicina\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===\nA 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | name-list-format = vanc | date=2005-02-14 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archive-date=2008-09-14 }}</ref> However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.

They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.<ref name=\"Carlson, N.

limit}}\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Deaf videoconference.jpg|thumb|A deaf person using a camera-equipped smartphone to communicate in sign language.]]\n*Hearing loss exists when there is diminished acuity to sounds normally heard.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.\n*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.\n*[[Speech perception]] \u2013 Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech discrimination. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech discrimination alone.  One example is [[auditory neuropathy]], a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the auditory nerve and brain properly.<ref name=\"eBook1\">eBook: ''Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery'', Lalwani, Anil K. (Ed.) Chapter 44: Audiologic Testing by Brady M. Klaves, PhD, Jennifer McKee Bold, AuD, Access Medicine</ref>\n\nUse of the terms \"hearing impaired\", \"deaf-mute\", or \"deaf and dumb\" to describe deaf and hard of hearing people is discouraged by many in the deaf community as well as advocacy organizations as they are offensive to many deaf and hard of hearing people.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=ReBecca |title=Time for Change |journal=The Hearing Journal |date=May 2019 |volume=72 |issue=5 |page=16 |doi=10.1097/01.HJ.0000559500.67179.7d }}</ref><ref name=NAD2016>{{cite web| title=Community and Culture - Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq| website=nad.org| publisher=National Association of the Deaf| access-date=27 Jan 2016| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227171131/http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq| archive-date=2015-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Hearing standards===\n\n{{See also| Absolute threshold of hearing| Hearing range}}\n\n{{further| Equal-loudness contour| A-weighting}}\n\nHuman hearing extends in frequency from 20\u201320,000&nbsp;Hz, and in intensity from 0&nbsp;dB to 120&nbsp;dB HL or more. 0&nbsp;dB does not represent absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to \u22125 or even \u221210&nbsp;dB.  Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90&nbsp;dB and 115&nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.<ref>ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age</ref><ref>ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n*difficulty using the [[telephone]]\n*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]\n*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]].\n*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])\n*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated\n*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources\n\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\n*pain or pressure in the ears\n*a blocked feeling\n\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\n*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as \"[[auditory recruitment]]\"\n*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present\n*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium\n*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals\n*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with [[Bell's palsy|Bell's Palsy]]\n\n=== Complications ===\nHearing loss is associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]].

Estimation of a \"safe\" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&nbsp;dB. As 3&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the \"safe\" daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the \"safe\" exposure at 91&nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.<ref>Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126</ref>\nDifferent standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.\n\nSome national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&nbsp;dB or 5&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B \u2013 GLOSSARY OF TERMS| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archive-date=2013-11-12| access-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.\n\nMany people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.\n\nIn the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.<ref name=\"kid\">{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archive-date=2009-12-21}}</ref>  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.<ref name=WHO2015Aud/>\n\nHearing loss due to noise has been described as primarily a condition of modern society.<ref name=Go2007>{{cite journal| last1=Goines| first1=Lisa| last2=Hagler| first2=Louis| name-list-format = vanc | title=Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague| journal=Southern Medical Journal| date=March 2007| volume=100| issue=3| pages=287\u2013294 | citeseerx=10.1.1.504.8717| doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3180318be5| pmid=17396733}}</ref> In preindustrial times, humans had far less exposure to loud sounds.

From a genetic standpoint, this accounts for the other 70% of cases, and represents the majority of hereditary hearing loss.<ref name=Harvard /> Syndromic cases occur with disorders such as [[Usher syndrome]], [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]], [[Alport's syndrome]], and [[neurofibromatosis type 2]]. These are diseases that have deafness as one of the symptoms or as a common feature associated with it. Many of the genetic mutations giving rise to syndromic deafness have been identified. In nonsyndromic cases, where deafness is the only finding, it is more difficult to identify the genetic mutation although some have been discovered.\n\n* Gene mapping has identified the genetic locations for several nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA#) and recessive (DFNB#) forms of deafness. The first gene mapped for non-syndromic deafness, DFNA1, involves a splice site mutation in the formin related homolog diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1). A single base change in a large [[Costa Rica]]n family was identified as causative in a rare form of low frequency onset progressive hearing loss with autosomal dominant inheritance exhibiting variable age of onset and complete penetrance by age 30.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch ED, Lee MK, Morrow JE, Welcsh PL, Le\u00f3n PE, King MC | title = Nonsyndromic deafness DFNA1 associated with mutation of a human homolog of the Drosophila gene diaphanous | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5341 | pages = 1315\u20138 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9360932 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5341.1315 | bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1315L | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d51fd6fc618b2769b79b82df451e5aace6f1f993 }}</ref> The most common type of congenital hearing loss in developed countries is DFNB1, also known as connexin 26 deafness or [[GJB2]]-related deafness.\n* The most common dominant syndromic forms of hearing loss include [[Stickler syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]].\n* The most common recessive syndromic forms of hearing loss are [[Pendred syndrome]] and [[Usher syndrome]].\n* The congenital defect [[microtia]], deformed or unformed outer ear, can be associated with partial or complete conductive deafness, depending upon the severity of the deformity and whether the middle ear is also affected.

The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.\n\nAuditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.\n\n===Scans===\n{{contradictory|date=August 2019}}\nMRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Classification===\nHearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.\n\n====Severity====\nThe severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&nbsp;Hz, 1000&nbsp;Hz, 2000&nbsp;Hz and 4000&nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.\n\nHearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* Slight: between 16 and 25&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild:\n** for adults: between 26 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n** for children: between 20 and 40&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderate: between 41 and 54&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Severe: between 71 and 90&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Profound: 91&nbsp;dB HL or greater<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.\n\nThe 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|access-date=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n* Moderate hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&nbsp;dB HL\n* Severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&nbsp;dB HL\n* Very severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&nbsp;dB HL\n** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&nbsp;dB HL\n* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&nbsp;dB HL\n\nHearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.\n\nFor certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized \"percentage of hearing loss\", which is suitable for legal purposes only.\n\n====Type====\nThere are three main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses are called a mixed hearing loss.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.\n\n*Conductive hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.\n\nDysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] \u2013 malleus, incus, and stapes \u2013 may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.\n\n*Sensorineural hearing loss\nSensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.<ref name=\"RussellPineYoung2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL | title = Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 841\u201363 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23905823 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 }}</ref>\n\n*Central deafness\nDamage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.\n\n*Mixed hearing loss\nMixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.\n\n*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]\n\nThis is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.\n\n====Configuration====\nThe shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.\nThere are four general configurations of hearing loss:\n\n1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.\n\n2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.\n\n3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.\n\n4. Trough-shaped (\"cookie-bite\" or \"U\" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.\n\n====Unilateral and bilateral====\nPeople with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:\n\n*hearing conversation on their impaired side\n*localizing sound\n*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.\n\nIn quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.\n\nOne reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]]. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.<ref name=\"pmid15148171\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieu JE | title = Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 524\u201330 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15148171 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.130.5.524 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common.

For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nMany in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as [[sign language]] or [[total communication]]. Many deaf people view cochlear implants and other hearing devices as confusing to one's identity. They feel a deaf person will never be a hearing person and therefore would be trying to fit into a way of living that is not their own. Other concerns include loss of [[deaf culture]] and identity and limitations on hearing restoration.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nJack Gannon, a professor at [[Gallaudet University]], said this about [[Deaf culture]]: \"Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences.\" Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, \"[deaf people] tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa... our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies.\"<ref>Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981)</ref> Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the \"pathological view of the deaf.\"<ref name=pathological>{{cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|access-date=14 May 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522030209/http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|archive-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers.

Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be \"cured,\" while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.\n\nMany other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.\n\n==Sign language==\n{{Main|Sign language}}\n[[File:Drawing (sign language friend), 2008.jpg|thumb|The sign language for \"friend\".]]\nSign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns.

An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.<ref name=\"SmithDD2010\" />\n\n====Family====\nThe communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.<ref name=\"FOSTER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Foster S | date = 1996 | chapter = Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. | veditors = Parasnis I | title = Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience | pages = 117\u2013136 | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Community====\n[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]\nPeople who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual's social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and \"messing around\" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nMany people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.\n\nThere are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act \"as if\" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life's meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one's inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one's communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.<ref name=\"SCHERER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Scherer MJ | date = 2004 | chapter = The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. | title = Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities | pages = 41\u201355 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Psychological Association }}</ref>\n\n====Workplace====\nIn most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person's career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nTo avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures<ref>Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.</ref> By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.\n\n====Health care====\nNot only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual's physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis.<ref name=\"Medicina\">Medicina Oral, Patolog\u00eda Oral y Cirug\u00eda Bucal.

Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual's severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.<ref name=\"Medicina\" /> Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.\n\nAlthough there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional's insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication.\nActs in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional's verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.<ref>Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter.

A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.<ref>Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., & Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.</ref>\n\nAside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient's needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.<ref name=\"Medicina\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===\nA 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | name-list-format = vanc | date=2005-02-14 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archive-date=2008-09-14 }}</ref> However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.

They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.<ref name=\"Carlson, N.

{"title_page": "Lip reading", "text_new": "'''Lip reading''' , also known as lipreading or '''speechreading''', is a technique of understanding [[speech]] by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face and tongue when normal sound is not available. It relies also on information provided by the context, knowledge of the language, and any residual hearing. Although lip reading is used most extensively by deaf and hard-of-hearing people, most people with normal hearing process some speech information from sight of the moving mouth.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = L | last2 = Hickson | first2 = L | last3 = Dodd | first3 = B | year = 2009 | title = Review of visual speech perception by hearing and hearing-impaired people: clinical implications | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 253\u201370 | doi = 10.1080/13682820802090281 | pmid = 18821117 }}</ref>\n\n== Process ==\n\nAlthough [[speech perception]] is considered to be an auditory skill, it is intrinsically multimodal, since producing speech requires the speaker to make  movements of the lips, teeth and tongue which are often visible in face-to-face communication. Information from the lips and face supports aural comprehension<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 5808871 | volume=12 | issue=2 | title=Interaction of audition and vision in the recognition of oral speech stimuli | year=1969 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=423\u20135 | last1 = Erber | first1 = NP | doi=10.1044/jshr.1202.423}}</ref> and most fluent listeners of a language are sensitive to seen speech actions (see [[McGurk effect]]).  The extent to which people make use of seen speech actions varies with the visibility of the speech action and the knowledge and skill of the perceiver.\n\n===Phonemes and visemes===\nThe [[phoneme]] is the smallest detectable unit of sound in a language that serves to distinguish words from one another. /pit/ and /pik/ differ by one phoneme and refer to different concepts. Spoken English has about 44 phonemes. For lip reading, the number of visually distinctive units - [[viseme]]s - is much smaller, thus several phonemes map onto a few visemes. This is because many phonemes are produced within the mouth and throat, and cannot be seen. These include [[glottal consonants]] and most gestures of the tongue. [[Voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] pairs look identical, such as [p] and [b], [k] and [g], [t] and [d], [f] and [v], and [s] and [z]; likewise for [[nasalisation]] (e.g. [m] vs. [b]). [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homophene Homophenes] are words that look similar when lip read, but which contain different phonemes. Because there are about three times as many phonemes as visemes in English, it is often claimed that only 30% of speech can be lip read. Homophenes are a crucial source of  [[Bad Lip Reading|mis-lip reading]].\n\n[[File:  Sam Loyd lipreading puzzle.jpg|thumb| The legend to this puzzle reads \"Here is a class of a dozen boys, who, being called up to give their names were photographed by the instantaneous process just as each one was commencing to pronounce his own name. The twelve names were Oom, Alden, Eastman, Alfred, Arthur, Luke, Fletcher, Matthew, Theodore, Richard, Shirmer, and Hisswald. Now it would not seem possible to be able to give the correct name to each of the twelve boys, but if you practice the list over to each one, you will find it not a difficult task to locate the proper name for every one of the boys.\"<ref>[[Sam Loyd|Sam Loyd's]] Cyclopedia of Puzzles, 1914</ref>\n]]\n\n===[[Co-articulation]]===\nVisemes can be captured as still images, but speech unfolds in time. The smooth articulation of speech sounds in sequence can mean that mouth patterns may be 'shaped' by an adjacent phoneme:  the 'th' sound in 'tooth' and in 'teeth' appears very different because of the [[vowel|vocalic]] context. This feature of dynamic speech-reading affects lip-reading 'beyond the viseme'.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7162162 | volume=25 | issue=4 | title=Coarticulation effects in lipreading | year=1982 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=600\u20137 | last1 = Benguerel | first1 = AP | last2 = Pichora-Fuller | first2 = MK | doi=10.1044/jshr.2504.600}}</ref>\n\n===How can it 'work' with so few visemes?===\nThe statistical distribution of phonemes within the lexicon of a language is uneven. While there are clusters of words which are phonemically similar to each other ('lexical neighbors', such as spit/sip/sit/stick...etc.), others are unlike all other words: they are 'unique' in terms of the distribution of their phonemes ('umbrella' may be an example). Skilled users of the language bring this knowledge to bear when interpreting speech, so it is generally harder to identify a heard word with many lexical neighbors than one with few neighbors. Applying this insight to seen speech, some words in the language can be unambiguously lip-read even when they contain few visemes - simply because no other words could possibly 'fit'.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | year = 2010 | title = Investigating speechreading and deafness | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Audiology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 163\u20138 | doi = 10.3766/jaaa.21.3.4 | pmid = 20211120 | pmc = 3715375 }}</ref>\n\n===Variation in readability and skill===\nMany factors affect the visibility of a speaking face, including illumination, movement of the head/camera, frame-rate of the moving image and distance from the viewer (see e.g.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = TR | last2 = Thomas | first2 = SM | year = 2011 | title = When half a face is as good as a whole: effects of simple substantial occlusion on visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = Atten Percept Psychophys | volume = 73 | issue = 7| pages = 2270\u201385 | doi = 10.3758/s13414-011-0152-4 | pmid = 21842332 | doi-access = free }}</ref>).

Systems may be based on detailed models derived from facial movements ([[motion capture]]); on anatomical modelling of actions of the jaw, mouth and tongue; or on mapping of known viseme- phoneme properties.<ref>http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rwalker/Walker/Publications_files/1996_CohenWalker%26Massaro_VisualSpeech.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A318099&dswid=2041 | title=Rule-Based Visual Speech Synthesis| pages=299\u2013302| year=1995}}</ref> Facial animation has been used in speechreading training (demonstrating how different sounds 'look').<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000006002.82367.4f | pmid=14714934 | volume=33 | issue=6 | title=Development and Evaluation of a Computer-Animated Tutor for Vocabulary and Language Learning in Children with Autism | journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | pages=653\u2013672|year = 2003|last1 = Bosseler|first1 = Alexis| last2=Massaro | first2=Dominic W. }}</ref> These systems are a subset of [[speech synthesis]] modelling which aim to deliver reliable 'text-to-(seen)-speech' outputs.

It relies also on information provided by the context, knowledge of the language, and any residual hearing. Although lip reading is used most extensively by deaf and hard-of-hearing people, most people with normal hearing process some speech information from sight of the moving mouth.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Woodhouse | first1 = L | last2 = Hickson | first2 = L | last3 = Dodd | first3 = B | year = 2009 | title = Review of visual speech perception by hearing and hearing-impaired people: clinical implications | url = | journal = International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 253\u201370 | doi = 10.1080/13682820802090281 | pmid = 18821117 }}</ref>\n\n== Process ==\n\nAlthough [[speech perception]] is considered to be an auditory skill, it is intrinsically multimodal, since producing speech requires the speaker to make  movements of the lips, teeth and tongue which are often visible in face-to-face communication. Information from the lips and face supports aural comprehension<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 5808871 | volume=12 | issue=2 | title=Interaction of audition and vision in the recognition of oral speech stimuli | year=1969 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=423\u20135 | last1 = Erber | first1 = NP | doi=10.1044/jshr.1202.423}}</ref> and most fluent listeners of a language are sensitive to seen speech actions (see [[McGurk effect]]).  The extent to which people make use of seen speech actions varies with the visibility of the speech action and the knowledge and skill of the perceiver.\n\n===Phonemes and visemes===\nThe [[phoneme]] is the smallest detectable unit of sound in a language that serves to distinguish words from one another. /pit/ and /pik/ differ by one phoneme and refer to different concepts. Spoken English has about 44 phonemes. For lip reading, the number of visually distinctive units - [[viseme]]s - is much smaller, thus several phonemes map onto a few visemes. This is because many phonemes are produced within the mouth and throat, and cannot be seen. These include [[glottal consonants]] and most gestures of the tongue. [[Voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] pairs look identical, such as [p] and [b], [k] and [g], [t] and [d], [f] and [v], and [s] and [z]; likewise for [[nasalisation]] (e.g. [m] vs. [b]). [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homophene Homophenes] are words that look similar when lip read, but which contain different phonemes. Because there are about three times as many phonemes as visemes in English, it is often claimed that only 30% of speech can be lip read. Homophenes are a crucial source of  [[Bad Lip Reading|mis-lip reading]].\n\n[[File:  Sam Loyd lipreading puzzle.jpg|thumb| The legend to this puzzle reads \"Here is a class of a dozen boys, who, being called up to give their names were photographed by the instantaneous process just as each one was commencing to pronounce his own name. The twelve names were Oom, Alden, Eastman, Alfred, Arthur, Luke, Fletcher, Matthew, Theodore, Richard, Shirmer, and Hisswald. Now it would not seem possible to be able to give the correct name to each of the twelve boys, but if you practice the list over to each one, you will find it not a difficult task to locate the proper name for every one of the boys.\"<ref>[[Sam Loyd|Sam Loyd's]] Cyclopedia of Puzzles, 1914</ref>\n]]\n\n===[[Co-articulation]]===\nVisemes can be captured as still images, but speech unfolds in time. The smooth articulation of speech sounds in sequence can mean that mouth patterns may be 'shaped' by an adjacent phoneme:  the 'th' sound in 'tooth' and in 'teeth' appears very different because of the [[vowel|vocalic]] context. This feature of dynamic speech-reading affects lip-reading 'beyond the viseme'.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7162162 | volume=25 | issue=4 | title=Coarticulation effects in lipreading | year=1982 | journal=J Speech Hear Res | pages=600\u20137 | last1 = Benguerel | first1 = AP | last2 = Pichora-Fuller | first2 = MK | doi=10.1044/jshr.2504.600}}</ref>\n\n===How can it 'work' with so few visemes?===\nThe statistical distribution of phonemes within the lexicon of a language is uneven. While there are clusters of words which are phonemically similar to each other ('lexical neighbors', such as spit/sip/sit/stick...etc.), others are unlike all other words: they are 'unique' in terms of the distribution of their phonemes ('umbrella' may be an example). Skilled users of the language bring this knowledge to bear when interpreting speech, so it is generally harder to identify a heard word with many lexical neighbors than one with few neighbors. Applying this insight to seen speech, some words in the language can be unambiguously lip-read even when they contain few visemes - simply because no other words could possibly 'fit'.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Auer | first1 = ET | year = 2010 | title = Investigating speechreading and deafness | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Audiology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 163\u20138 | doi = 10.3766/jaaa.21.3.4 | pmid = 20211120 | pmc = 3715375 }}</ref>\n\n===Variation in readability and skill===\nMany factors affect the visibility of a speaking face, including illumination, movement of the head/camera, frame-rate of the moving image and distance from the viewer (see e.g.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = TR | last2 = Thomas | first2 = SM | year = 2011 | title = When half a face is as good as a whole: effects of simple substantial occlusion on visual and audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = Atten Percept Psychophys | volume = 73 | issue = 7| pages = 2270\u201385 | doi = 10.3758/s13414-011-0152-4 | pmid = 21842332 | doi-access = free }}</ref>).

Each language uses [[phonetic]] combinations of [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., \"role\" or \"hotel\"), and using those words in their semantic character as  words in the [[lexicon]] of a [[language]] according to the [[Syntax|syntactic]] constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional [[speech act]]s, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use [[Elocution|enunciation]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], degrees of [[loudness]], [[tempo]], and other non-representational or [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] aspects of vocalization to convey meaning.  In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]], normal consciousness and [[trance]] states), education or experience, and the like.\n\nAlthough people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people [[Profanity|swear]] they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something.  There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People [[Talking to oneself|talk to themselves]] sometimes in acts that are a development of what some [[psychologist]]s (e.g., [[Lev Vygotsky]]) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|interior monologue]] to vivify and organize [[cognition]], sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  Solo speech can be used [[Memorization|to memorize]] or to test one's memorization of things, and in [[prayer]] or in [[meditation]] (e.g., the use of a [[mantra]]).\n\nResearchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and [[speech perception]] of the [[Sound|sounds]] used in a [[language]], [[speech repetition]], [[speech error]]s, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in [[children]]'s enlargement of their [[vocabulary]], and what different areas of the [[human brain]], such as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication studies]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[speech pathology]], [[otolaryngology]], and [[acoustics]]. \nSpeech compares with [[written language]],<ref>{{American Heritage Dictionary|https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=speech|Speech}}</ref> which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called [[diglossia]].\n\nThe evolutionary [[origin of language|origins of speech]] are unknown and subject to much debate and [[speculation]]. While [[Animal language|animals also communicate]] using vocalizations, and trained [[apes]] such as [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] and [[Kanzi]] can use simple [[sign language]], no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.\n\n== Production ==\n{{main|Speech production|Linguistics}}\n\nSpeech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem J. M.|year=1999|title=Models of word production|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223\u201332|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01319-4|pmid=10354575}}</ref>\n\nIn [[linguistics]] ([[articulatory phonetics]]), [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by [[manner of articulation]] and [[place of articulation]]. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. [[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]], implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics|last=Catford|first=J.C.|last2=Esling|first2=J.H.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Keith|edition=2nd|location=Amsteram|pages=425\u201342|chapter=Articulatory Phonetics}}</ref> The concept is primarily used for the production of [[consonant]]s, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as [[Voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[nasalization]]. For any [[place of articulation]], there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several [[homorganic]] consonants.\n\nNormal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the [[lung]]s, which creates [[phonation]] in the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]], which is then modified by the [[vocal tract]] and mouth into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]], of which there are three types: [[esophageal speech]], pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as [[Donald Duck talk]]).\n\n=== Speech errors ===\n{{main|Speech error}}\n\nSpeech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Mouton|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=11\u201346|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and [[Language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Kim|last2=Juola|first2=Patrick|year=1999|title=A connectionist model of english past tense and plural morphology|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463\u201390|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2304_4|citeseerx=10.1.1.545.3746}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170\u201397|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x|year=2012}}</ref> Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of [[expressive aphasia]] patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Michael T.|display-authors=etal|year=2005|title=Neural correlates of lexicon and grammar: Evidence from the production, reading, and judgement of inflection in aphasia.|url=|journal=Brain and Language|volume=93|issue=2|pages=185\u2013238|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.10.001|pmid=15781306}}</ref>\n\n==Perception==\n{{main|Speech perception}}\n\nSpeech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand [[spoken language]]. Research into speech perception also has applications in building [[speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to Language Development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}</ref>\n\nSpeech perception is [[Categorical perception|categorical]], in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is [[Voice-onset time|voice onset time]] (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kishon-Rabin|first=Liat|last2=Rotshtein|first2=Shira|last3=Taitelbaum|first3=Riki|year=2002|title=Underlying Mechanism for Categorical Perception: Tone-Onset Time and Voice-Onset Time Evidence of Hebrew Voicing|url=|journal=Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117\u201334|doi=10.1515/jbcpp.2002.13.2.117|pmid=16411426}}</ref>\n\n==Repetition==\n{{main|Speech repetition}}\n\nIn speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]]). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masur|first=Elise|year=1995|title=Infants' Early Verbal Imitation and Their Later Lexical Development|url=|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286\u2013306|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Problems involving speech==\n{{See also|Speech-language pathology}}\n\nThere are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:\n\n# Diseases and disorders of the [[lung]]s or the [[vocal cords]], including [[paralysis]], respiratory infections (bronchitis), [[vocal fold nodules]] and [[cancer]]s of the lungs and throat.\n# Diseases and disorders of the [[brain]], including [[alogia]], [[aphasia]]s, [[dysarthria]], [[dystonia]] and [[speech processing]] disorders, where impaired [[motor planning]], nerve transmission, phonological processing or perception of the message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.\n# Hearing problems, such as [[otitis media|otitis media with effusion]], and listening problems, [[auditory processing disorder]]s, can lead to phonological problems.\n# Articulatory problems, such as [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisping]], [[cleft palate]], [[ataxia]], or [[nerve]] damage leading to problems in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]]. [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic]]s can also affect speech. Various [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired [[tongue disease]]s can affect speech as can [[motor neuron disease]].\n# In addition to [[dysphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]] and [[auditory processing disorder]] can impede the quality of auditory perception, and therefore, expression.  Those who are [[deafness|Hard of Hearing]] or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.\n\n==Brain physiology==\n\n=== The classical model ===\n[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|180x180px|Broca's and Wernicke's areas.]]\n\nThe classical or [[Wernicke\u2013Geschwind model|Wernicke-Geschwind model]] of the language system in the brain focuses on [[Broca's area]] in the inferior [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[Wernicke's area]] in the posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] on the [[Lateralization of brain function|dominant hemisphere]] of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the [[auditory cortex]] to Wernicke's area. The [[lexicon]] is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the [[arcuate fasciculus]] to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the [[motor cortex]] for articulation.<ref>Kertesz, A. (2005). \"Wernicke\u2013Geschwind Model\". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.</ref>\n\n[[Paul Broca]] identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or [[expressive aphasia]], is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in [[telegraphic speech]]. In expressive aphasia, speech comprehension is generally less affected except in the comprehension of grammatically complex sentences.<ref name=\":0\">Hillis, A.E., & Caramazza, A.

Each language uses [[phonetic]] combinations of [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., \"role\" or \"hotel\"), and using those words in their semantic character as  words in the [[lexicon]] of a [[language]] according to the [[Syntax|syntactic]] constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional [[speech act]]s, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use [[Elocution|enunciation]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], degrees of [[loudness]], [[tempo]], and other non-representational or [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] aspects of vocalization to convey meaning.  In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]], normal consciousness and [[trance]] states), education or experience, and the like.\n\nAlthough people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people [[Profanity|swear]] they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something.  There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People [[Talking to oneself|talk to themselves]] sometimes in acts that are a development of what some [[psychologist]]s (e.g., [[Lev Vygotsky]]) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|interior monologue]] to vivify and organize [[cognition]], sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  Solo speech can be used [[Memorization|to memorize]] or to test one's memorization of things, and in [[prayer]] or in [[meditation]] (e.g., the use of a [[mantra]]).\n\nResearchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and [[speech perception]] of the [[Sound|sounds]] used in a [[language]], [[speech repetition]], [[speech error]]s, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in [[children]]'s enlargement of their [[vocabulary]], and what different areas of the [[human brain]], such as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication studies]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[speech pathology]], [[otolaryngology]], and [[acoustics]]. \nSpeech compares with [[written language]],<ref>{{American Heritage Dictionary|https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=speech|Speech}}</ref> which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called [[diglossia]].\n\nThe evolutionary [[origin of language|origins of speech]] are unknown and subject to much debate and [[speculation]]. While [[Animal language|animals also communicate]] using vocalizations, and trained [[apes]] such as [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] and [[Kanzi]] can use simple [[sign language]], no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.\n\n== Production ==\n{{main|Speech production|Linguistics}}\n\nSpeech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem J. M.|year=1999|title=Models of word production|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223\u201332|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01319-4|pmid=10354575}}</ref>\n\nIn [[linguistics]] ([[articulatory phonetics]]), [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by [[manner of articulation]] and [[place of articulation]]. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. [[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]], implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics|last=Catford|first=J.C.|last2=Esling|first2=J.H.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Keith|edition=2nd|location=Amsteram|pages=425\u201342|chapter=Articulatory Phonetics}}</ref> The concept is primarily used for the production of [[consonant]]s, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as [[Voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[nasalization]]. For any [[place of articulation]], there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several [[homorganic]] consonants.\n\nNormal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the [[lung]]s, which creates [[phonation]] in the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]], which is then modified by the [[vocal tract]] and mouth into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]], of which there are three types: [[esophageal speech]], pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as [[Donald Duck talk]]).\n\n=== Speech errors ===\n{{main|Speech error}}\n\nSpeech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Mouton|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=11\u201346|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and [[Language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Kim|last2=Juola|first2=Patrick|year=1999|title=A connectionist model of english past tense and plural morphology|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463\u201390|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2304_4|citeseerx=10.1.1.545.3746}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170\u201397|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x|year=2012}}</ref> Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of [[expressive aphasia]] patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Michael T.|display-authors=etal|year=2005|title=Neural correlates of lexicon and grammar: Evidence from the production, reading, and judgement of inflection in aphasia.|url=|journal=Brain and Language|volume=93|issue=2|pages=185\u2013238|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.10.001|pmid=15781306}}</ref>\n\n==Perception==\n{{main|Speech perception}}\n\nSpeech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand [[spoken language]]. Research into speech perception also has applications in building [[speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to Language Development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}</ref>\n\nSpeech perception is [[Categorical perception|categorical]], in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is [[Voice-onset time|voice onset time]] (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kishon-Rabin|first=Liat|last2=Rotshtein|first2=Shira|last3=Taitelbaum|first3=Riki|year=2002|title=Underlying Mechanism for Categorical Perception: Tone-Onset Time and Voice-Onset Time Evidence of Hebrew Voicing|url=|journal=Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117\u201334|doi=10.1515/jbcpp.2002.13.2.117|pmid=16411426}}</ref>\n\n==Repetition==\n{{main|Speech repetition}}\n\nIn speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]]). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masur|first=Elise|year=1995|title=Infants' Early Verbal Imitation and Their Later Lexical Development|url=|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286\u2013306|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Problems involving speech==\n{{See also|Speech-language pathology}}\n\nThere are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:\n\n# Diseases and disorders of the [[lung]]s or the [[vocal cords]], including [[paralysis]], respiratory infections (bronchitis), [[vocal fold nodules]] and [[cancer]]s of the lungs and throat.\n# Diseases and disorders of the [[brain]], including [[alogia]], [[aphasia]]s, [[dysarthria]], [[dystonia]] and [[speech processing]] disorders, where impaired [[motor planning]], nerve transmission, phonological processing or perception of the message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.\n# Hearing problems, such as [[otitis media|otitis media with effusion]], and listening problems, [[auditory processing disorder]]s, can lead to phonological problems.\n# Articulatory problems, such as [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisping]], [[cleft palate]], [[ataxia]], or [[nerve]] damage leading to problems in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]]. [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic]]s can also affect speech. Various [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired [[tongue disease]]s can affect speech as can [[motor neuron disease]].\n# In addition to [[dysphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]] and [[auditory processing disorder]] can impede the quality of auditory perception, and therefore, expression.  Those who are [[deafness|Hard of Hearing]] or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.\n\n==Brain physiology==\n\n=== The classical model ===\n[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|180x180px|Broca's and Wernicke's areas.]]\n\nThe classical or [[Wernicke\u2013Geschwind model|Wernicke-Geschwind model]] of the language system in the brain focuses on [[Broca's area]] in the inferior [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[Wernicke's area]] in the posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] on the [[Lateralization of brain function|dominant hemisphere]] of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the [[auditory cortex]] to Wernicke's area. The [[lexicon]] is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the [[arcuate fasciculus]] to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the [[motor cortex]] for articulation.<ref>Kertesz, A. (2005). \"Wernicke\u2013Geschwind Model\". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.</ref>\n\n[[Paul Broca]] identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or [[expressive aphasia]], is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in [[telegraphic speech]]. In expressive aphasia, speech comprehension is generally less affected except in the comprehension of grammatically complex sentences.<ref name=\":0\">Hillis, A.E., & Caramazza, A.

They are different topics. -->\nThe term '''''man''''' (from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*mannaz'' or ''*manwaz'' \"man, person\") and words derived from it can designate any or even all of the [[human race]] regardless of their sex or age. In traditional usage, ''man'' (without an article) itself refers to the species or to humanity (mankind) as a whole.\n\nThe Germanic word developed into [[Old English]] ''man, mann'' meaning primarily \"adult male human\" but secondarily capable of designating a person of unspecified gender, \"someone, one\" or humanity at large (see also [[Old Norse]] ''ma\u00f0r'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''manna'' \"man\"). ''*Mannaz'' or ''*Manwaz'' is also the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed name of the [[Mannaz rune|''m''-rune]] {{runic|\u16d7}}.\nMore restricted English terms for an adult male were ''wer'' (cognate: Latin ''vir''; survives as the first element in \"werewolf\") and ''guma'' (cognate: Latin ''homo''; survives as the second element in \"bridegroom\").\n\nAdopting the [[Names_for_the_human_species|term for the human species]] to refer to males is a common feature of  Romance and Germanic languages, but  is not found in most [[Names_for_the_human_species#In_the_world's_languages|other European languages]] (Slavic ''\u010delov\u011bk\u044a'' vs. ''m\u01eb\u017e\u044c'', Greek \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 vs. \u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, Finnish ''[[:wikt:ihminen#Finnish|ihminen]]'' vs. ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Finnic/mees|mies]]''   etc.). \n\n==Etymology==\nIt is derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*man-'' (see [[Sanskrit]]/[[Avestan]] ''manu-'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''m\u01eb\u017e'' \"man, male\").<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary'', Appendix I: Indo-European Roots.

The hypothetically reconstructed Proto-Indo-European form ''*Manus'' may also have played a role in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] based on this, if there is any connection with the figure of ''[[Mannus]]'' &mdash; reported by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] in ca. AD 70 to be the name of a traditional ancestor of the Germanic peoples and son of [[Tuisto]]; modern sources other than Tacitus have reinterpreted this as \"first man\".<ref>Annihilating Difference: The Anthropology of Genocide, p. 12, Alexander Laban Hinton, University of California Press, 2002</ref>\n\nIn Old English the words ''{{lang|ang|wer}}'' and ''{{lang|ang|w\u012bf}}'' (and ''{{lang|ang|w\u012bfmann}}'') were used to refer to \"a man\" and \"a woman\" respectively, while ''{{lang|ang|mann}}'' had the primary meaning of \"adult male human\" but could also be used for gender neutral purposes (as is the case with modern German ''{{lang|de|man}}'', corresponding to the pronoun in the English utterance \"one does what one must\").\n\nSome etymologies treat the root as an independent one, as does the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''. Of the etymologies that do make connections with other Indo-European roots, man \"the thinker\" is the most traditional \u2014 that is, the word is connected with the root *''{{PIE|men-}}'' \"to think\" ([[cognate]] to ''mind''). This etymology relies on humans describing themselves as \"those who think\" (see [[Human self-reflection]]). This etymology, however, is not generally accepted. A second potential etymology connects with [[Latin]] ''{{Lang|la|manus}}'' (\"hand\"), which has the same form as [[Sanskrit]] ''manus''.<ref>George Hempl, \"Etymologies\", The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 22, No. 4 (1901), pp. 426-431, The Johns Hopkins University Press [https://www.jstor.org/stable/288335]</ref>\n\nAnother speculative etymology postulates the reduction of the ancestor of \"human\" to the ancestor of \"man\". Human is from *''{{PIE|dhghem-}}'', \"earth\", thus implying *''{{PIE|(dh)ghom-on-}}'' would be an \"earthdweller\". The latter word, when reduced to just its final syllable, would be merely *''m-on-''{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. This is the view of [[Eric Partridge]], ''Origins'', under ''man''. Such a derivation might be credible if only the Germanic form was known, but the attested Indo-Iranian ''manu'' virtually excludes the possibility. Moreover, *''{{PIE|(dh)ghom-on-}}'' is known to have survived in Old English not as ''{{lang|ang|mann}}'' but as ''{{lang|ang|guma}}'', the ancestor of the second element of the Modern English word ''bridegroom''.<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary s.v.

That article is about adult males, this article is about the history and use of the word man to refer exclusively to adult males, versus using it gender neutrally. They are different topics. -->\nThe term '''''man''''' (from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*mannaz'' or ''*manwaz'' \"man, person\") and words derived from it can designate any or even all of the [[human race]] regardless of their sex or age. In traditional usage, ''man'' (without an article) itself refers to the species or to humanity (mankind) as a whole.\n\nThe Germanic word developed into [[Old English]] ''man, mann'' meaning primarily \"adult male human\" but secondarily capable of designating a person of unspecified gender, \"someone, one\" or humanity at large (see also [[Old Norse]] ''ma\u00f0r'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''manna'' \"man\"). ''*Mannaz'' or ''*Manwaz'' is also the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed name of the [[Mannaz rune|''m''-rune]] {{runic|\u16d7}}.\nMore restricted English terms for an adult male were ''wer'' (cognate: Latin ''vir''; survives as the first element in \"werewolf\") and ''guma'' (cognate: Latin ''homo''; survives as the second element in \"bridegroom\").\n\nAdopting the [[Names_for_the_human_species|term for the human species]] to refer to males is a common feature of  Romance and Germanic languages, but  is not found in most [[Names_for_the_human_species#In_the_world's_languages|other European languages]] (Slavic ''\u010delov\u011bk\u044a'' vs. ''m\u01eb\u017e\u044c'', Greek \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 vs. \u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, Finnish ''[[:wikt:ihminen#Finnish|ihminen]]'' vs. ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Finnic/mees|mies]]''   etc.). \n\n==Etymology==\nIt is derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*man-'' (see [[Sanskrit]]/[[Avestan]] ''manu-'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''m\u01eb\u017e'' \"man, male\").<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary'', Appendix I: Indo-European Roots.

Accessed 2007-07-22.</ref> The Slavic forms ([[Russian language|Russian]] ''muzh'' \"man, male\" etc.) are derived from a suffixed stem ''*man-gyo-''.{{cn|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn [[Hindu mythology]], ''[[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'' is the name of the traditional [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|progenitor of humankind]] who survives a deluge and gives mankind laws. The hypothetically reconstructed Proto-Indo-European form ''*Manus'' may also have played a role in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] based on this, if there is any connection with the figure of ''[[Mannus]]'' &mdash; reported by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] in ca. AD 70 to be the name of a traditional ancestor of the Germanic peoples and son of [[Tuisto]]; modern sources other than Tacitus have reinterpreted this as \"first man\".<ref>Annihilating Difference: The Anthropology of Genocide, p. 12, Alexander Laban Hinton, University of California Press, 2002</ref>\n\nIn Old English the words ''{{lang|ang|wer}}'' and ''{{lang|ang|w\u012bf}}'' (and ''{{lang|ang|w\u012bfmann}}'') were used to refer to \"a man\" and \"a woman\" respectively, while ''{{lang|ang|mann}}'' had the primary meaning of \"adult male human\" but could also be used for gender neutral purposes (as is the case with modern German ''{{lang|de|man}}'', corresponding to the pronoun in the English utterance \"one does what one must\").\n\nSome etymologies treat the root as an independent one, as does the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''. Of the etymologies that do make connections with other Indo-European roots, man \"the thinker\" is the most traditional \u2014 that is, the word is connected with the root *''{{PIE|men-}}'' \"to think\" ([[cognate]] to ''mind''). This etymology relies on humans describing themselves as \"those who think\" (see [[Human self-reflection]]). This etymology, however, is not generally accepted. A second potential etymology connects with [[Latin]] ''{{Lang|la|manus}}'' (\"hand\"), which has the same form as [[Sanskrit]] ''manus''.<ref>George Hempl, \"Etymologies\", The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 22, No. 4 (1901), pp. 426-431, The Johns Hopkins University Press [https://www.jstor.org/stable/288335]</ref>\n\nAnother speculative etymology postulates the reduction of the ancestor of \"human\" to the ancestor of \"man\". Human is from *''{{PIE|dhghem-}}'', \"earth\", thus implying *''{{PIE|(dh)ghom-on-}}'' would be an \"earthdweller\". The latter word, when reduced to just its final syllable, would be merely *''m-on-''{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. This is the view of [[Eric Partridge]], ''Origins'', under ''man''. Such a derivation might be credible if only the Germanic form was known, but the attested Indo-Iranian ''manu'' virtually excludes the possibility. Moreover, *''{{PIE|(dh)ghom-on-}}'' is known to have survived in Old English not as ''{{lang|ang|mann}}'' but as ''{{lang|ang|guma}}'', the ancestor of the second element of the Modern English word ''bridegroom''.<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary s.v.
