It operates [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft for [[airlift]] and [[airdrop]] operations.\n\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated in June 1942 as the '''53d Troop Carrier Squadron'''.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], where it participated in the airborne assault on Sicily, for which it earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).  It moved to England, where it participated in the [[D Day]] airborne assault, for which it earned a second DUC, and in [[Operation Market Garden]], the attempt to secure a bridgehead across the [[Rhine River]] in the Netherlands.  Following [[V-E Day]], it participated in the movement of American troops back to the United States before inactivating in July 1945.\n\nThe squadron was reactivated in France in 1946, moving to Germany, where it participated in the [[Berlin Airlift]].  It returned to the United States in 1950, but soon deployed to Japan, where it provided [[airlift]] during the [[Korean War]].  The squadron was inactivated in 1966, but reactivated as the '''53d Military Airlift Squadron''' in 1972.  Except for a brief period of inactivation in 1993, it has been a strategic airlift unit since then.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nConstituted as 53 Transport Squadron on 30 May 1942 and activated on 1 June 1942 with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]s at [[Pope Field]], [[North Carolina|NC]]. 2 Lt Glen A.

Prepared for the [[invasion]] of [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. In June 1944, subordinate units dropped paratroops in [[Normandy]], subsequently flying numerous missions to bring in reinforcements and needed supplies. During the airborne attack on The Netherlands ([[Operation Market Garden]], September 1944), the squadron dropped paratroops, towed gliders, and flew resupply missions. Several of its subordinate units also participated in the invasion of southern France in August 1944. The 50th supported the 101st Airborne Division in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] by towing gliders full of supplies near [[Bastogne]] on 27 December 1944.  \n\nWhen the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] made the air assault across the [[Rhine River]] in March 1945, each aircraft towed two gliders with troops of the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]] and released them near [[Wesel]]. The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals.\n\nIn late May 1945, after [[V-E Day]], the squadron was moved to [[Waller Field]], Trinidad and attached to [[Air Transport Command]].   From Trinidad, the squadron ferried returning military personnel to Morrison Field, Florida, where they were sent on to other bases or prepared for separation after the war.

It operates [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft for [[airlift]] and [[airdrop]] operations.\n\nThe [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated in June 1942 as the '''53d Troop Carrier Squadron'''.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], where it participated in the airborne assault on Sicily, for which it earned a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).  It moved to England, where it participated in the [[D Day]] airborne assault, for which it earned a second DUC, and in [[Operation Market Garden]], the attempt to secure a bridgehead across the [[Rhine River]] in the Netherlands.  Following [[V-E Day]], it participated in the movement of American troops back to the United States before inactivating in July 1945.\n\nThe squadron was reactivated in France in 1946, moving to Germany, where it participated in the [[Berlin Airlift]].  It returned to the United States in 1950, but soon deployed to Japan, where it provided [[airlift]] during the [[Korean War]].  The squadron was inactivated in 1966, but reactivated as the '''53d Military Airlift Squadron''' in 1972.  Except for a brief period of inactivation in 1993, it has been a strategic airlift unit since then.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nConstituted as 53 Transport Squadron on 30 May 1942 and activated on 1 June 1942 with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]s at [[Pope Field]], [[NC]]. 2 Lt Glen A. Myers was the unit's first commanding officer.<ref name=53ASfacts/>\n\nAssigned to [[I Troop Carrier Command]] as a troop carrier squadron, trained in the United States.  Assigned to [[Twelfth Air Force]] and deployed North Africa during May 1943.<ref name=53ASfacts/>  The squadron's aircraft flew supplies to front-line units in Algeria and Tunisia during the [[North African Campaign]] as soon as suitable landing strips were available and evacuated casualties back to rear area field hospitals. Redesignated 53 Troop Carrier Squadron on 4 July 1942.<ref name=53ASfacts/> \n\nSquadron engaged in combat operations, dropping airborne units into Sicily during the [[Operation Husky]] invasion and later into areas around [[Anzio]], Italy as part of [[Operation Shingle]], the invasion of mainland Italy and the initiation of the Italian Campaign, January 1944.  Moved north though Italy, in 1943 in support of Allied ground forces, evacuated wounded personnel and flew missions behind enemy lines in Italy and the Balkans to haul guns, ammunition, food, clothing, medical supplies, and other materials to the partisans and to drop propaganda leaflets.\n\nWas moved to England in February 1944, assigned to [[IX Troop Carrier Command]].  Prepared for the [[invasion]] of [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. In June 1944, subordinate units dropped paratroops in [[Normandy]], subsequently flying numerous missions to bring in reinforcements and needed supplies. During the airborne attack on The Netherlands ([[Operation Market Garden]], September 1944), the squadron dropped paratroops, towed gliders, and flew resupply missions. Several of its subordinate units also participated in the invasion of southern France in August 1944. The 50th supported the 101st Airborne Division in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] by towing gliders full of supplies near [[Bastogne]] on 27 December 1944.  \n\nWhen the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] made the air assault across the [[Rhine River]] in March 1945, each aircraft towed two gliders with troops of the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]] and released them near [[Wesel]]. The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals.\n\nIn late May 1945, after [[V-E Day]], the squadron was moved to [[Waller Field]], Trinidad and attached to [[Air Transport Command]].   From Trinidad, the squadron ferried returning military personnel to Morrison Field, Florida, where they were sent on to other bases or prepared for separation after the war. Redesignated 53 Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium, on 1st July 1948 and 53 Troop Carrier Squadron, Heavy, on 15 Aug 1948.<ref name=53ASfacts/>\n\n===Berlin airlift===\nThe squadron participated in the [[Berlin Airlift]], 1948\u20131949.<ref name=53ASfacts/>\n\n===Korean war===\nIt conducted aerial transportation from the U.S. to Japan from August\u2013December 1950, and between Japan and Korea from 13 December 1950 \u2013 November 1952.  \n\n===Airlift operations===\nIt conducted worldwide airlift operations from 1953 to 1966, including resupply to Antarctica from 1957 to 1958, and missions to Southeast Asia during the [[Vietnam War]].

As part of his duties Shadow Ministers had to clear the timing of their announcements with Lansley. He fitted them into a timetable known as the 'Stalingrid'. The 2001 election was not a success for the Conservative Party and party leader, [[William Hague]], resigned in its wake. [[Iain Duncan Smith]], the new leader, offered Lansley a position after the election but he turned this down and, until [[Michael Howard]] became Leader, Lansley was a backbencher.\n\nLansley was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] on 13 May 2010.<ref name=\"pc-13may2010\">{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/other/13th%20May2010%20List.doc |publisher=Privy Council Office |title=Orders for 13 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611044054/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/other/13th%20May2010%20List.doc |archivedate=11 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Shadow Cabinet==\nAfter Howard's election as party leader, Lansley soon returned to the Conservative frontbench.
