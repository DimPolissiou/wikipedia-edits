He was the son of Abraham Falch Muus, and his grandfather was Isach Muus, the owner of \u00c5sen and Ullev\u00e5l farms. Rudolf grew up at \u00c5sen farm, close to the working class districts of [[Sagene]] and [[Torshov]].

When he was about 7\u20138 years old, he was the [[theatre director]] for Aasen Theater and instructed young actors in little plays he had written himself. At the age of 12, he finished off a book on [[fairy tales]], but it was never published. In 1881 he completed the [[examen artium]] (the [[entrance examination]] required for acceptance to university level studies) in one year, and after further studies at the [[University of Oslo]] he earned the title of Cand. Philos.\n\nMuus was married to Olga Erikka J\u00f8rgine, with whom he had ten children. His wife a musician and had performed at [[Kristiania]] Theater. Their home became a meeting place for artists and musicians. Muus enjoyed outdoor life, and particularly picked up an interest in fishing and picking mushrooms.\n\n==Literary work==\nMuus wrote about 50 novels, many of them very long. Many of these were [[crime fiction]] characterized by [[chase scene]]s and some light romance. In many of his stories, the plot took place in [[Kristiania]] (the former name of [[Oslo]]). Many of Muus\u2019 stories were descriptions of city environments long gone from the present city of [[Oslo]]. In addition he also translated several [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] novels.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/Rudolf_Muus|title= Rudolf Muus|publisher = Norsk biografisk leksikon\t|author=    Willy Bakken|accessdate= February 1, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nMuus\u2019 first published work was printed in [[Morgenbladet]] in 1881, under the title ''En myr''. According to Muus this was a \u201cpoetic-political idyll\u201d, where he compares certain political conditions with [[moss]] swamps. His first fictional work that was publicly well-known was the comedy ''Ole H\u00f8iland'', which was written in 1883 and performed the same year at M\u00f8llergatens Theater. The following year he wrote the story ''Smedens datter'', which was published under the name \u201cR.M\u201d. Later came ''Kongemordet i Bergen'' and ''Svenskene p\u00e5 Norderhov'', under the [[pseudonym]] Rollo. In 1885 he started writing Kristiania novels, the first one being ''Gardistens kj\u00e6reste''.\n\nIn addition to Kristiania novels Muus later on wrote [[crime fiction]] and stories about rural districts. Muus was interested in [[Norway|Norwegian]] history, and studied the topic throughout his life. On his 25th anniversary as a writer, he stated that the historical stories ''Ravn den fredl\u00f8se'' and ''Olaf Trygvess\u00f8n'' were his favourites in his writing career up till that point. Muus also wrote [[cookbooks]] and a [[sex education]] book under the name \u201cProfessor J. Souris\u201d. Throughout his career he wrote under some 40 different names, including Sigmund Tofte, Bj\u00f8rn Farmann, Gaston Ring, Rolf Ragnvalds\u00f8n, Herman Brage, Spectator, Diogenes, Maximos and Rollo. The [[pseudonyms]] was used for different reasons. At one point he wrote for two competing publishers, and to prevent the publishers from finding out, he used the name Wilhelm at one publisher and Julius at the other.\n\nIn his books, Muus often let the [[underclass]] represent the villains, while the financially strong [[upper class]] represented the heroes. Several of his comedies were performed in Arbeidersamfunnet (a labor community), where he often visited as a guest. A few times he stepped in as an actor when the original cast could not perform.\n\nA normal fee for writers of fiction at the time was about 10-15 [[Norwegian kroner]] per 16 page piece, regardless of the size of [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]]. Handing in scripts at a steady pace therefore became a necessity in order to keep food on the table. The majority of the profits from Muus\u2019 books and booklets fell into the hands of the publishing companies. One publisher made 50-60 thousand [[Norwegian kroner]] in one year on Muus\u2019 books alone. Converted into today\u2019s currency value, this number can be multiplied by one hundred.\n\nThe total production of Muus\u2019 books is difficult to estimate. Due to his fascination with disguises and fake names, Muus operated with many [[pseudonym]]s. An estimate is complicated by the many obscure publishing companies that released his books. His works sold millions of copied, and at his time he was more read than [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Several of his books were also sold as translated pirated editions abroad.\n\n== Miscellaneous==\nThough it was not mentioned in the opening credits, the movie ''[[Trysil-Knut]]'' was based on Muus\u2019 book about the skilled [[cross-country skier]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muus, Rudolf}}\n[[Category:1862 births]]\n[[Category:1935 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Akershus]]\n[[Category:Norwegian male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}\n'''Rudolf Muus''' (February 19, 1862 &ndash; November 9, 1935) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] author of popular literature.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=   https://snl.no/Rudolf_Muus|title= Rudolf Muus|publisher = Store norske leksikon|author=   Hans H.
