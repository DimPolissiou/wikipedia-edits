Accidental forks on the bitcoin network regularly occur as part of the mining process. They happen when two miners find a block at a similar point in time. As a result, the network briefly forks. This fork is subsequently resolved by the software which automatically chooses the longest chain, thereby orphaning the extra blocks added to the shorter chain (that were dropped by the longer chain).\n\n===March 2013===\nOn 12 March 2013, a bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 of the bitcoin software created a large block that was considered invalid in version 0.7 (due to an undiscovered inconsistency between the two versions).\nThis created a split or \"fork\" in the blockchain since computers with the recent version of the software accepted the invalid block and continued to build on the diverging chain, whereas older versions of the software rejected it and continued extending the blockchain without the offending block.\nThis split resulted in two separate transaction logs being formed without clear consensus, which allowed for the same funds to be spent differently on each chain.

Accidental forks on the bitcoin network regularly occur as part of the mining process. They happen when two miners find a block at a similar point in time. As a result, the network briefly forks. This fork is subsequently resolved by the software which automatically chooses the longest chain, thereby orphaning the extra blocks added to the shorter chain (that were dropped by the longer chain).\n\n===March 2013===\nOn 12 March 2013, a bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 of the bitcoin software created a large block that was considered invalid in version 0.7 (due to an undiscovered inconsistency between the two versions).\nThis created a split or \"fork\" in the blockchain since computers with the recent version of the software accepted the invalid block and continued to build on the diverging chain, whereas older versions of the software rejected it and continued extending the blockchain without the offending block.\nThis split resulted in two separate transaction logs being formed without clear consensus, which allowed for the same funds to be spent differently on each chain.

A regular player, he was nicknamed \"The All-American Out\" by [[Babe Ruth]].<ref>Joe Niese, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mjAMLYylcasC&pg=PA189&dq=%22leo+durocher%22+ruth+%22all+american+out%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Az0BU6-5HoTJygGsnoH4Dw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22leo%20durocher%22%20ruth%20%22all%20american%20out%22&f=false Burleigh Grimes: Baseball's Last Legal Spitballer], 2013, page 189</ref> Durocher was a favorite of Yankee manager [[Miller Huggins]], who saw in him the seeds of a great manager \u2014 the competitiveness, the passion, the ego, the facility for remembering situations. Durocher's outspokenness did not endear him to Yankee ownership, however, and his habit of passing bad checks to finance his expensive tastes in clothes and nightlife annoyed Yankee general manager [[Ed Barrow]].\n\n[[File:LeoDurocherGoudeycard.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Durocher's 1933 [[Goudey]] baseball card]]\nDurocher helped the team win their second consecutive [[World Series]] title in [[1928 World Series|1928]] then demanded a raise and was later sold to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] on February 5, 1930. Durocher spent the remainder of his professional career in the [[National League]].\n\nAfter playing three seasons with the Reds, Durocher was traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in mid-1933. Upon joining the Cardinals he was assigned uniform number 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/durocle01.php|title=Leo Durocher Baseball Stats, facts, biography, images and video|publisher=The Baseball Page|date=|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> which he wore for the rest of his career, as player, coach and manager. That team, whose famous nickname \"[[Gashouse Gang]]\" was supposedly inspired by Durocher, were a far more appropriate match for him; in St. Louis, Durocher's characteristics as a fiery player and vicious bench jockey were given full rein. Durocher remained with the Cardinals through the 1937 season, captaining the team and winning the [[1934 World Series]] (their third title in nine years) before being traded to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].\n\nPrimarily a [[shortstop]], Durocher played through 1945, though his last year as a regular was 1939; after that year he never played more than 62 games in a season. He was known as a solid fielder but a poor hitter. In 5,350 career at bats, he [[batting average (baseball)|batted]] .247, hit 24 [[home run]]s and had 567 [[run batted in|runs batted in]].\n\nDurocher was named to the NL's [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team three times, once with St. Louis and twice with the Dodgers. In the [[1938 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1938 game in Cincinnati]], Durocher hit the only [[Little League Home Run]] in All-Star Game history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XHRHZx5X6tR1ScLK3MCvuFctBQq_JHPYJQKdnJGoqJQ/edit#gid=64175734|title=Little League Home Runs Database|publisher=SABR|date=|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1938, Durocher made history of a sort by making the final out in [[Johnny Vander Meer]]'s second consecutive no-hitter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records|page=[https://archive.org/details/baseballstop100g0000bank/page/55 55]|first=Kerry|last=Banks|year=2010|publisher=Greystone Books|location=Vancouver, BC|isbn=978-1-55365-507-7|url=https://archive.org/details/baseballstop100g0000bank/page/55}}</ref>\n\n==Managing==\n\n===Managerial career===\nAfter the 1938 season \u2014 Durocher's first year as Brooklyn's starting shortstop \u2014 he was appointed player-manager by the Dodgers' new president and [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]], [[Larry MacPhail]]. The two were a successful and combustible combination. MacPhail spared no expense in purchasing and trading for useful players (and sometimes outright stars), such as [[Dolph Camilli]], [[Billy Herman]] and [[Kirby Higbe]]. He also purchased [[shortstop]] [[Pee Wee Reese]] from the [[Boston Red Sox]]. By the end of the 1941 season, Reese impressed Durocher enough that he gave up his spot as the regular shortstop so Reese could get a chance to play, though Durocher would make \"cameo\" appearances in the lineup in 1943 and 1945. Other major purchases by MacPhail included another young star, [[Pete Reiser]], when he was ruled a [[free agent]] from the Cardinals' [[farm system]]; and MacPhail found stalwarts such as American League veterans [[Dixie Walker]] and [[Whitlow Wyatt]] off the waiver wire.\n\nIn his first season as player-manager, Durocher came into his own. The most enduring image of Durocher is of him standing toe-to-toe with an umpire, vehemently arguing his case until his inevitable ejection from the game. Durocher's fiery temper and willingness to scrap came to epitomize the position for which he was to become most famous. As manager he valued these same traits in his players. His philosophy was best expressed in the phrase for which he is best, albeit inaccurately, remembered: \"[[nice guy|Nice guys finish last]]\" (Durocher's actual phrasing \"Nice guys, finish last\" was a pair of clause fragments describing a team). Durocher once said, \"Look at [[Mel Ott]] over there. He's a nice guy, and he finishes second. Now look at the Brat ([[Eddie Stanky]]). He can't hit, can't run, can't field. He's no nice guy, but all the little son-of-a-bitch can do is win.\"\n\nDurocher was also notorious for ordering his pitchers to hit batters. Whenever he wanted a batter hit, he would yell, \"Stick it in his ear!\"\n\nIn 1939 the Dodgers were coming off six straight losing seasons, but Durocher led a quick turnaround. In 1941, his third season as manager, he led the Dodgers to a 100\u201354 record and the National League pennant, their first in 21 years. In the [[1941 World Series]] the Dodgers lost to the Yankees in five games. They bettered their record in 1942, winning 104 games but just missing out on winning a second consecutive pennant.\n\nDespite all the success of his first three years, Durocher and MacPhail had a tempestuous relationship. MacPhail was a notorious drinker, and he was as hot-tempered as his manager. He often fired Durocher in the midst of a night of drinking. The following morning, however, MacPhail inevitably hired Durocher back. Finally, at the end of the 1942 season, MacPhail's tenure with the Dodgers came to an end when he resigned to rejoin the [[United States Army]]. His replacement, former Cardinal boss [[Branch Rickey]], retained Durocher as skipper. Durocher managed the Dodgers continuously through 1946 (having ceased as a player during the 1945 season), and led Brooklyn to the first postseason NL playoff series in history, where they lost to the Cardinals, two games to none.\n\nDurocher also clashed regularly with Commissioner [[Happy Chandler|Albert \"Happy\" Chandler]]. Chandler, who had been named to the post in 1945, warned Durocher to stay away from some of his old friends who were gamblers, bookmakers, or had mob connections, and who had a free rein at [[Ebbets Field]]. Durocher was particularly close with actor [[George Raft]], with whom he shared a Los Angeles house, and he admitted to a nodding acquaintance with [[Bugsy Siegel]].\n\nDurocher, who encouraged and participated in card schools within the clubhouse, was something of a pool shark himself and a friend to many pool hustlers. He also followed horse racing closely. Matters came to a head when Durocher's affair with married actress [[Laraine Day]] became public knowledge, drawing criticism from Brooklyn's influential [[Catholic Youth Organization]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Catholics Quit Dodgers Knothole Club In Protest Over the Conduct of Durocher|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/03/01/88763303.html?pageNumber=17|accessdate=March 4, 2016|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 1, 1947|page=17}}</ref> The two later eloped and married in Texas in 1947.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laraine Day and Durocher Are Married In El Paso After She Gets Mexican Divorce|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/01/22/88740360.html?pageNumber=25|accessdate=March 4, 2016|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 22, 1947|page=25}}</ref> In the 1950s, Day hosted a radio program called ''Day with the Giants'', and later authored a book by the same title describing the life of a manager's wife.\n\n===Managerial record===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center;font-size:100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"| From\n! rowspan=\"2\"| To\n! colspan=\"3\"| Regular season record\n! colspan=\"3\"| Post\u2013season record\n! rowspan=\"2\"| {{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n! {{Tooltip|W|Games won}}\n! {{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}\n! {{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n! {{Tooltip|W|Games won}}\n! {{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}\n! {{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n| [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]\n| 1939\n| 1946\n| {{WinLossPct|703|528}}\n| {{WinLossPct|1|4}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\">{{cite web|title=Leo Durocher|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/durocle01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| Brooklyn Dodgers\n| 1948\n| 1948\n| {{WinLossPct|35|37}}\n| colspan=\"3\"| \u2014\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]\n| 1948\n| 1955\n| {{WinLossPct|637|523}}\n| {{WinLossPct|6|4}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| [[Chicago Cubs]]\n| 1966\n| 1972\n| {{WinLossPct|535|526}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\"| \u2014\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| [[Houston Astros]]\n| 1972\n| 1973\n| {{WinLossPct|98|95}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| Total\n! {{WinLossPct|2008|1709}}\n! {{WinLossPct|7|8}}\n! \u2014\n|}\n\n==Nice guys finish last==\n{{further|Nice guy}}\nThe saying \"[[wikt:nice guys finish last|nice guys finish last]]\" is a condensation by journalists of a quotation by Durocher<ref>{{cite news|first=Ray|last=Robinson|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D71639F937A35757C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=A Bad Guy Who Finished First|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 4, 1993}}</ref>\u2014he did not originally say this, himself, though it has often been [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations|attributed to him]], and he did appropriate it as his own.

Journal American'', 1946 July 7</ref><ref name=yale>''The Yale Book of Quotations'', Fred R.

This was shortly afterwards rendered as \"'Nice Guys' Wind Up in Last Place, Scoffs Lippy\",<ref>''Sporting News'', 1946 July 17</ref> thence its present form.<ref name=yale/> Durocher is also credited with popularizing the metaphorical use of the phrase \"capture [[wikt:lightning in a bottle|lightning in a bottle]]\" in a baseball context\u2014it had previously been used to literally refer to [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s [[kite experiment]].\n\nIn his autobiography, ''Nice Guys Finish Last'' (1975), Durocher quoted himself incorrectly, 29 years afterward, as his sayings were contradicted by the contemporary records (see references above), although they show his philosophy, as epitomized in this maxim:\n\n{{quote|The Giants, led by Mel Ott, began to come out of their dugout to take their warm-up. Without missing a beat, I said, \"Take a look at that Number Four there. A nicer guy never drew breath than that man there.\" I called off his players' names as they came marching up the steps behind him, \"Walker Cooper, Mize, Marshall, Kerr, Gordon, Thomson. Take a look at them. All nice guys. They'll finish last. Nice guys. Finish last.\" I said, \"They lose a ball game, they go home, they have a nice dinner, they put their heads down on the pillow and go to sleep. Poor Mel Ott, he can't sleep at night. He wants to win, he's got a job to do for the owner of the ball club. But that doesn't concern the players, they're all getting good money.\" I said, \"you surround yourself with this type of player, they're real nice guys, sure\u2014'Howarya, Howarya' and you're going to finish down in the cellar with them. Because they think they're giving you one hundred percent on the ball field and they're not. Give me some scratching, diving, hungry ballplayers who come to kill you. Now, Stanky's the nicest gentleman who ever drew breath, but when the bell rings you're his mortal enemy. That's the kind of a guy I want playing for me.\" That was the context. To explain why Eddie Stanky was so valuable to me by comparing him to a group of far more talented players who were\u2014in fact\u2014in last place. Frankie Graham did write it up that way. In that respect, Graham was the most remarkable reporter I ever met. He would sit there and never take a note, and then you'd pick up the paper and find yourself quoted word for word. But the other writers who picked it up ran two sentences together to make it sound as if I were saying that you couldn't be a decent person and succeed.}}\n\n==Suspension==\nDuring spring training 1947, Durocher became involved in a very unpleasant feud with Larry MacPhail, who had become a new co-owner of the Yankees. The Yankee boss had hired away two coaches from Durocher's 1946 staff ([[Chuck Dressen]] and [[Red Corriden]]) during the off-season, causing friction. Then, matters got worse.\n\nIn person, Durocher and MacPhail exchanged a series of accusations and counter-accusations, with each suggesting the other invited gamblers into their clubhouses. In the press, a ghostwritten article appeared under Durocher's name in the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'', seeking to stir the rivalry between their respective clubs and accusing baseball of a double standard for Chandler's warning him against his associations but not MacPhail or other baseball executives.\n[[File:Baseball. Durocher BAnQ P48S1P12826.jpg|thumb|Durocher in the dressing room of [[Delorimier Stadium]] in Montreal in July 1946.]]\nChandler was pressured by MacPhail, a close friend who was pivotal in having him appointed commissioner, but the commissioner also discovered Durocher and Raft might have run a rigged crap game that took an active ballplayer for a large sum of money. (The player's identity was never confirmed officially, but a former [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit Tiger]] pitcher, [[Elden Auker]], wrote in his 2002 memoir that it was a then-current Tiger pitcher, [[Dizzy Trout]].) Chandler suspended Durocher for the 1947 season for \"association with known gamblers\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Effrat|first1=Louis|title=Chandler Bars Durocher For 1947 Baseball Season|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/04/10/88777421.html?pageNumber=1|accessdate=March 4, 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=April 10, 1947|page=1}}</ref>\n\nBefore being suspended, however, Durocher played a noteworthy role in erasing baseball's [[Baseball color line|color line]]. In the spring of 1947, he let it be known that he would not tolerate the dissent of those players on the team who opposed [[Jackie Robinson]]'s joining the club, saying:\n\n<blockquote>I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded.</blockquote>\n\nHe greatly admired Robinson for his hustle and aggression, calling him \"a Durocher with talent.\"\n\nWhile Durocher sat out his suspension, the Dodgers went on to win the NL pennant under an interim skipper, scout [[Burt Shotton]]. They then went on to lose the [[1947 World Series]] to MacPhail's Yankees in seven games.\n\n==Move to New York Giants==\n[[File:Leo Durocher 1948.png|thumb|180px|Durocher with the Giants in 1948.]]\nDurocher returned for the 1948 season, but his outspoken personality and poor results on the field again caused friction with Rickey, and on July 16 Durocher, Rickey and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] owner [[Horace Stoneham]] negotiated a deal whereby Durocher was let out of his Brooklyn contract to take over the Dodgers' cross-town rivals. He enjoyed perhaps his greatest success with the Giants, and possibly a measure of sweet revenge against the Dodgers, as the Giants won the 1951 NL pennant in a playoff against Brooklyn, ultimately triumphing on [[Bobby Thomson]]'s historic game-winning  [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|\"Shot 'Heard 'Round The World\"]] home run.\n\nLater with the Giants in 1954, Durocher won his only [[1954 World Series|World Series]] championship as a manager by sweeping the heavily favored [[Cleveland Indians]], who posted the highest American League winning percentage of all time (111\u201343) during the regular season.\n\nAfter leaving the Giants following the 1955 season, Durocher worked at [[NBC]], where he was a color commentator on the ''[[Major League Baseball on NBC]]'' and host of ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour|The NBC Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]''. He later served as a coach for the Dodgers, by then relocated to Los Angeles, from 1961 to 1964.\n\nDuring this period, Durocher, who had made his screen debut in the 1943 [[Red Skelton]] comedy ''[[Whistling in Brooklyn]]'', played himself in many television shows. In an April 10, 1963 airing of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', Durocher plays golf with Jed Clampett ([[Buddy Ebsen]]) and Jethro Bodine ([[Max Baer, Jr.]]) and tries to sign Jethro to a baseball contract after discovering Jethro has a strong pitching arm. In an episode of ''[[The Munsters]]'' titled \"Herman the Rookie,\" on April 8, 1965, Durocher believes Herman ([[Fred Gwynne]]) is the next [[Mickey Mantle]] when he sees the towering Munster hit long home runs. Football great [[Elroy Hirsch]] also appears with Durocher. Three years earlier, he also appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[Mr. Ed]]'', when the talking horse gave batting tips to the Los Angeles Dodgers, helping them win the pennant. Durocher also appeared on television in the early 1950s on the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[game show]] ''[[What's My Line?]]'' twice as a mystery guest (January 28, 1951 and May 31, 1953), the latter when his wife Day was a guest panelist.\n\n==Chicago Cubs==\nDurocher returned to the managerial ranks in 1966 with the [[Chicago Cubs]]. In several previous seasons, the Cubs had tried an experiment called the \"[[College of Coaches]]\", in which they were led by a \"head coach\" rather than a manager. However, at his first press conference, Durocher formally announced an end to the experiment by saying:\n\n{{quote|If no announcement has been made about what my title is, I'm making it here and now. I'm the manager. I'm not a head coach. I'm the manager.<ref>Munzel, Edgar. \"Bruins Give 3-Year Pact to Durocher.\" ''[[The Sporting News]]'', 1965-11-06.</ref>}}\n\nAt the same press conference, Durocher declared, \"I am not the manager of an eighth place team.\" He was right; the Cubs finished tenth in his first season, becoming the first team to finish behind the previously hapless [[New York Mets]]. In 1967, however, the Cubs started strongly and had only their second winning season since 1946. The team steadily improved, but in [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|1969]], Durocher suffered one of his most remembered failures. The Cubs started the season on a tear, and led the newly created National League East for 105 days. By mid-August they had a seemingly insurmountable {{frac|9|1|2}} game cushion, and they appeared to be a shoo-in for their first postseason appearance in 25 years. However, they floundered down the stretch, and finished eight games behind the \"[[1969 New York Mets season|Miracle Mets]]\".\n\nIn a mid-July series against the Mets, the Cubs were beaten in the first two games at [[Shea Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1969/VCHN01969.htm |title=The 1969 Chicago Cubs Game Log |publisher=Retrosheet.org |date= |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> but finally managed to salvage the third game, after which Durocher was asked if those were the real Cubs.\n\n'\"No\", Durocher answered, \"those are the real Mets.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWhile with the Cubs, Durocher encountered a difficult dilemma in regard to aging superstar [[Ernie Banks]]. While Banks' bad knees made him a liability, his legendary status made benching him impossible. Durocher also nearly came to blows with Cubs star [[Ron Santo]] during an infamous clubhouse near-riot. The problems were symbolic of Durocher's difficulty in managing the new breed of wealthier, more outspoken players who had come up during his long career. With a mediocre record of 46-44, Durocher was fired midway through the [[1972 in baseball|1972 season]], later stating that his greatest regret in baseball was not being able to win a pennant for longtime Cubs owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]].\n\n==Houston Astros and beyond==\nDurocher managed the [[Houston Astros]] for the final 31 games of the 1972 season (posting a 16\u201315 record in that span) and the entire 1973 season (posting an 82\u201380 record) before retiring.\n\nHe made a brief comeback in 1976 in the Japanese [[Pacific League]] with the [[Taiheiyo Club Lions]], but he retired due to illness ([[hepatitis]]) before the beginning of the season.<ref>Markus, Robert.

He posted a winning record with each of the four teams he led, and was the first manager to win 500 games with three different clubs.\n\nDurocher, with Ed Linn, wrote a memoir titled ''Nice Guys Finish Last'', a book that was recently re-published by the [[University of Chicago Press]].\n\nLeo Durocher died in 1991 in [[Palm Springs, California]] at the age of 86, and is buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

July 27, 1905 \u2013 October 7, 1991), nicknamed '''Leo the Lip''' and '''Lippy''', was an American professional [[baseball]] player, [[manager (baseball)|manager]] and [[coach (baseball)|coach]]. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] as an [[infielder]]. Upon his retirement, he ranked fifth all-time among managers with 2,008 [[MLB All-time Managerial wins|career victories]], second only to [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]] in [[National League]] history. Durocher still ranks tenth in career wins by a manager. A controversial and outspoken character, Durocher had a stormy career dogged by clashes with authority, the baseball commissioner, the press, and umpires; his 95 career ejections as a manager trailed only McGraw when he retired, and still rank fourth on the all-time list.\n\nDurocher was posthumously elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nLeo Durocher was born in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]], on July 27, 1905, the youngest of four sons born to [[French Canadian]] parents.<ref name=\"NEHS\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/leo-durocher-springfield-boy/ |title=In Springfield, Leo Durocher Learned How Not To Be Nice |website=New England Historical Society.com |publisher=New England Historical Society |location=Stonington, ME |access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref>  His mother was a hotel maid and his father was a railroad engineer who died of a heart attack soon after Durocher's birth.<ref name=\"NEHS\"/>  His parents were immigrants from [[Quebec]] and both they and Durocher's older brothers spoke only [[French language|French]]; Durocher began attending elementary school without knowing how to speak [[English language|English]].<ref name=\"NEHS\"/>\n\nThe Durochers lived only two blocks from [[Rabbit Maranville]], who taught Durocher the game of baseball and gave him a glove.<ref name=\"NEHS\"/>  Durocher became a good athlete while in high school, and was offered a scholarship to [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]], but was suspended from school after he hit a teacher, and never returned.<ref name=\"NEHS\"/>  Durocher became a prominent semi-professional athlete, with several Springfield-area employers competing to have him play on their company teams.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Spatz | editor-first=Lyle | title=The Team That Forever Changed Baseball and America: The 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers | date=2012 | publisher=University of Nebraska Press and the Society for American Baseball Research | location=Lincoln, Neb. | isbn=978-0-8032-3992-0 | page=23 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ3-FxuViDUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate=March 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nAfter being scouted by the [[New York Yankees]], Durocher broke into professional baseball with the [[Hartford Senators]] of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] in 1925. He was called up to the Yankees and played in two games. Durocher spent two more seasons in the minors, playing for the [[Atlanta Crackers]] of the [[Southern Association]] in 1926 and [[St. Paul Saints (1901\u201360)|St. Paul Saints]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] in 1927.<ref>H.

Durocher's outspokenness did not endear him to Yankee ownership, however, and his habit of passing bad checks to finance his expensive tastes in clothes and nightlife annoyed Yankee general manager [[Ed Barrow]].\n\n[[File:LeoDurocherGoudeycard.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Durocher's 1933 [[Goudey]] baseball card]]\nDurocher helped the team win their second consecutive [[World Series]] title in [[1928 World Series|1928]] then demanded a raise and was later sold to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] on February 5, 1930. Durocher spent the remainder of his professional career in the [[National League]].\n\nAfter playing three seasons with the Reds, Durocher was traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in mid-1933. Upon joining the Cardinals he was assigned uniform number 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/durocle01.php|title=Leo Durocher Baseball Stats, facts, biography, images and video|publisher=The Baseball Page|date=|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> which he wore for the rest of his career, as player, coach and manager. That team, whose famous nickname \"[[Gashouse Gang]]\" was supposedly inspired by Durocher, were a far more appropriate match for him; in St. Louis, Durocher's characteristics as a fiery player and vicious bench jockey were given full rein. Durocher remained with the Cardinals through the 1937 season, captaining the team and winning the [[1934 World Series]] (their third title in nine years) before being traded to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].\n\nPrimarily a [[shortstop]], Durocher played through 1945, though his last year as a regular was 1939; after that year he never played more than 62 games in a season. He was known as a solid fielder but a poor hitter. In 5,350 career at bats, he [[batting average (baseball)|batted]] .247, hit 24 [[home run]]s and had 567 [[run batted in|runs batted in]].\n\nDurocher was named to the NL's [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team three times, once with St. Louis and twice with the Dodgers. In the [[1938 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1938 game in Cincinnati]], Durocher hit the only [[Little League Home Run]] in All-Star Game history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XHRHZx5X6tR1ScLK3MCvuFctBQq_JHPYJQKdnJGoqJQ/edit#gid=64175734|title=Little League Home Runs Database|publisher=SABR|date=|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1938, Durocher made history of a sort by making the final out in [[Johnny Vander Meer]]'s second consecutive no-hitter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records|page=[https://archive.org/details/baseballstop100g0000bank/page/55 55]|first=Kerry|last=Banks|year=2010|publisher=Greystone Books|location=Vancouver, BC|isbn=978-1-55365-507-7|url=https://archive.org/details/baseballstop100g0000bank/page/55}}</ref>\n\n==Managing==\n\n===Managerial career===\nAfter the 1938 season \u2014 Durocher's first year as Brooklyn's starting shortstop \u2014 he was appointed player-manager by the Dodgers' new president and [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]], [[Larry MacPhail]]. The two were a successful and combustible combination. MacPhail spared no expense in purchasing and trading for useful players (and sometimes outright stars), such as [[Dolph Camilli]], [[Billy Herman]] and [[Kirby Higbe]]. He also purchased [[shortstop]] [[Pee Wee Reese]] from the [[Boston Red Sox]]. By the end of the 1941 season, Reese impressed Durocher enough that he gave up his spot as the regular shortstop so Reese could get a chance to play, though Durocher would make \"cameo\" appearances in the lineup in 1943 and 1945. Other major purchases by MacPhail included another young star, [[Pete Reiser]], when he was ruled a [[free agent]] from the Cardinals' [[farm system]]; and MacPhail found stalwarts such as American League veterans [[Dixie Walker]] and [[Whitlow Wyatt]] off the waiver wire.\n\nIn his first season as player-manager, Durocher came into his own. The most enduring image of Durocher is of him standing toe-to-toe with an umpire, vehemently arguing his case until his inevitable ejection from the game. Durocher's fiery temper and willingness to scrap came to epitomize the position for which he was to become most famous. As manager he valued these same traits in his players. His philosophy was best expressed in the phrase for which he is best, albeit inaccurately, remembered: \"[[nice guy|Nice guys finish last]]\" (Durocher's actual phrasing \"Nice guys, finish last\" was a pair of clause fragments describing a team). Durocher once said, \"Look at [[Mel Ott]] over there. He's a nice guy, and he finishes second. Now look at the Brat ([[Eddie Stanky]]). He can't hit, can't run, can't field. He's no nice guy, but all the little son-of-a-bitch can do is win.\"\n\nDurocher was also notorious for ordering his pitchers to hit batters. Whenever he wanted a batter hit, he would yell, \"Stick it in his ear!\"\n\nIn 1939 the Dodgers were coming off six straight losing seasons, but Durocher led a quick turnaround. In 1941, his third season as manager, he led the Dodgers to a 100\u201354 record and the National League pennant, their first in 21 years. In the [[1941 World Series]] the Dodgers lost to the Yankees in five games. They bettered their record in 1942, winning 104 games but just missing out on winning a second consecutive pennant.\n\nDespite all the success of his first three years, Durocher and MacPhail had a tempestuous relationship. MacPhail was a notorious drinker, and he was as hot-tempered as his manager. He often fired Durocher in the midst of a night of drinking. The following morning, however, MacPhail inevitably hired Durocher back. Finally, at the end of the 1942 season, MacPhail's tenure with the Dodgers came to an end when he resigned to rejoin the [[United States Army]]. His replacement, former Cardinal boss [[Branch Rickey]], retained Durocher as skipper. Durocher managed the Dodgers continuously through 1946 (having ceased as a player during the 1945 season), and led Brooklyn to the first postseason NL playoff series in history, where they lost to the Cardinals, two games to none.\n\nDurocher also clashed regularly with Commissioner [[Happy Chandler|Albert \"Happy\" Chandler]]. Chandler, who had been named to the post in 1945, warned Durocher to stay away from some of his old friends who were gamblers, bookmakers, or had mob connections, and who had a free rein at [[Ebbets Field]]. Durocher was particularly close with actor [[George Raft]], with whom he shared a Los Angeles house, and he admitted to a nodding acquaintance with [[Bugsy Siegel]].\n\nDurocher, who encouraged and participated in card schools within the clubhouse, was something of a pool shark himself and a friend to many pool hustlers. He also followed horse racing closely. Matters came to a head when Durocher's affair with married actress [[Laraine Day]] became public knowledge, drawing criticism from Brooklyn's influential [[Catholic Youth Organization]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Catholics Quit Dodgers Knothole Club In Protest Over the Conduct of Durocher|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/03/01/88763303.html?pageNumber=17|accessdate=March 4, 2016|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 1, 1947|page=17}}</ref> The two later eloped and married in Texas in 1947.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laraine Day and Durocher Are Married In El Paso After She Gets Mexican Divorce|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/01/22/88740360.html?pageNumber=25|accessdate=March 4, 2016|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 22, 1947|page=25}}</ref> In the 1950s, Day hosted a radio program called ''Day with the Giants'', and later authored a book by the same title describing the life of a manager's wife.\n\n===Managerial record===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center;font-size:100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"| From\n! rowspan=\"2\"| To\n! colspan=\"3\"| Regular season record\n! colspan=\"3\"| Post\u2013season record\n! rowspan=\"2\"| {{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n! {{Tooltip|W|Games won}}\n! {{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}\n! {{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n! {{Tooltip|W|Games won}}\n! {{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}\n! {{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n| [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]\n| 1939\n| 1946\n| {{WinLossPct|703|528}}\n| {{WinLossPct|1|4}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\">{{cite web|title=Leo Durocher|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/durocle01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| Brooklyn Dodgers\n| 1948\n| 1948\n| {{WinLossPct|35|37}}\n| colspan=\"3\"| \u2014\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]\n| 1948\n| 1955\n| {{WinLossPct|637|523}}\n| {{WinLossPct|6|4}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| [[Chicago Cubs]]\n| 1966\n| 1972\n| {{WinLossPct|535|526}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\"| \u2014\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| [[Houston Astros]]\n| 1972\n| 1973\n| {{WinLossPct|98|95}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| Total\n! {{WinLossPct|2008|1709}}\n! {{WinLossPct|7|8}}\n! \u2014\n|}\n\n==Nice guys finish last==\n{{further|Nice guy}}\nThe saying \"[[wikt:nice guys finish last|nice guys finish last]]\" is a condensation by journalists of a quotation by Durocher<ref>{{cite news|first=Ray|last=Robinson|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D71639F937A35757C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=A Bad Guy Who Finished First|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 4, 1993}}</ref>\u2014he did not originally say this, himself, though it has often been [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations|attributed to him]], and he did appropriate it as his own.

But that doesn't concern the players, they're all getting good money.\" I said, \"you surround yourself with this type of player, they're real nice guys, sure\u2014'Howarya, Howarya' and you're going to finish down in the cellar with them. Because they think they're giving you one hundred percent on the ball field and they're not. Give me some scratching, diving, hungry ballplayers who come to kill you. Now, Stanky's the nicest gentleman who ever drew breath, but when the bell rings you're his mortal enemy. That's the kind of a guy I want playing for me.\" That was the context. To explain why Eddie Stanky was so valuable to me by comparing him to a group of far more talented players who were\u2014in fact\u2014in last place. Frankie Graham did write it up that way. In that respect, Graham was the most remarkable reporter I ever met. He would sit there and never take a note, and then you'd pick up the paper and find yourself quoted word for word. But the other writers who picked it up ran two sentences together to make it sound as if I were saying that you couldn't be a decent person and succeed.}}\n\n==Suspension==\nDuring spring training 1947, Durocher became involved in a very unpleasant feud with Larry MacPhail, who had become a new co-owner of the Yankees. The Yankee boss had hired away two coaches from Durocher's 1946 staff ([[Chuck Dressen]] and [[Red Corriden]]) during the off-season, causing friction. Then, matters got worse.\n\nIn person, Durocher and MacPhail exchanged a series of accusations and counter-accusations, with each suggesting the other invited gamblers into their clubhouses. In the press, a ghostwritten article appeared under Durocher's name in the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]'', seeking to stir the rivalry between their respective clubs and accusing baseball of a double standard for Chandler's warning him against his associations but not MacPhail or other baseball executives.\n[[File:Baseball. Durocher BAnQ P48S1P12826.jpg|thumb|Durocher in the dressing room of [[Delorimier Stadium]] in Montreal in July 1946.]]\nChandler was pressured by MacPhail, a close friend who was pivotal in having him appointed commissioner, but the commissioner also discovered Durocher and Raft might have run a rigged crap game that took an active ballplayer for a large sum of money. (The player's identity was never confirmed officially, but a former [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit Tiger]] pitcher, [[Elden Auker]], wrote in his 2002 memoir that it was a then-current Tiger pitcher, [[Dizzy Trout]].) Chandler suspended Durocher for the 1947 season for \"association with known gamblers\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Effrat|first1=Louis|title=Chandler Bars Durocher For 1947 Baseball Season|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/04/10/88777421.html?pageNumber=1|accessdate=March 4, 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=April 10, 1947|page=1}}</ref>\n\nBefore being suspended, however, Durocher played a noteworthy role in erasing baseball's [[Baseball color line|color line]]. In the spring of 1947, he let it be known that he would not tolerate the dissent of those players on the team who opposed [[Jackie Robinson]]'s joining the club, saying:\n\n<blockquote>I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded.</blockquote>\n\nHe greatly admired Robinson for his hustle and aggression, calling him \"a Durocher with talent.\"\n\nWhile Durocher sat out his suspension, the Dodgers went on to win the NL pennant under an interim skipper, scout [[Burt Shotton]]. They then went on to lose the [[1947 World Series]] to MacPhail's Yankees in seven games.\n\n==Move to New York Giants==\n[[File:Leo Durocher 1948.png|thumb|180px|Durocher with the Giants in 1948.]]\nDurocher returned for the 1948 season, but his outspoken personality and poor results on the field again caused friction with Rickey, and on July 16 Durocher, Rickey and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] owner [[Horace Stoneham]] negotiated a deal whereby Durocher was let out of his Brooklyn contract to take over the Dodgers' cross-town rivals. He enjoyed perhaps his greatest success with the Giants, and possibly a measure of sweet revenge against the Dodgers, as the Giants won the 1951 NL pennant in a playoff against Brooklyn, ultimately triumphing on [[Bobby Thomson]]'s historic game-winning  [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|\"Shot 'Heard 'Round The World\"]] home run.\n\nLater with the Giants in 1954, Durocher won his only [[1954 World Series|World Series]] championship as a manager by sweeping the heavily favored [[Cleveland Indians]], who posted the highest American League winning percentage of all time (111\u201343) during the regular season.\n\nAfter leaving the Giants following the 1955 season, Durocher worked at [[NBC]], where he was a color commentator on the ''[[Major League Baseball on NBC]]'' and host of ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour|The NBC Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[Jackpot Bowling]]''. He later served as a coach for the Dodgers, by then relocated to Los Angeles, from 1961 to 1964.\n\nDuring this period, Durocher, who had made his screen debut in the 1943 [[Red Skelton]] comedy ''[[Whistling in Brooklyn]]'', played himself in many television shows. In an April 10, 1963 airing of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', Durocher plays golf with Jed Clampett ([[Buddy Ebsen]]) and Jethro Bodine ([[Max Baer, Jr.]]) and tries to sign Jethro to a baseball contract after discovering Jethro has a strong pitching arm. In an episode of ''[[The Munsters]]'' titled \"Herman the Rookie,\" on April 8, 1965, Durocher believes Herman ([[Fred Gwynne]]) is the next [[Mickey Mantle]] when he sees the towering Munster hit long home runs. Football great [[Elroy Hirsch]] also appears with Durocher. Three years earlier, he also appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[Mr. Ed]]'', when the talking horse gave batting tips to the Los Angeles Dodgers, helping them win the pennant. Durocher also appeared on television in the early 1950s on the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[game show]] ''[[What's My Line?]]'' twice as a mystery guest (January 28, 1951 and May 31, 1953), the latter when his wife Day was a guest panelist.\n\n==Chicago Cubs==\nDurocher returned to the managerial ranks in 1966 with the [[Chicago Cubs]]. In several previous seasons, the Cubs had tried an experiment called the \"[[College of Coaches]]\", in which they were led by a \"head coach\" rather than a manager. However, at his first press conference, Durocher formally announced an end to the experiment by saying:\n\n{{quote|If no announcement has been made about what my title is, I'm making it here and now. I'm the manager. I'm not a head coach. I'm the manager.<ref>Munzel, Edgar. \"Bruins Give 3-Year Pact to Durocher.\" ''[[The Sporting News]]'', 1965-11-06.</ref>}}\n\nAt the same press conference, Durocher declared, \"I am not the manager of an eighth place team.\" He was right; the Cubs finished tenth in his first season, becoming the first team to finish behind the previously hapless [[New York Mets]]. In 1967, however, the Cubs started strongly and had only their second winning season since 1946. The team steadily improved, but in [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|1969]], Durocher suffered one of his most remembered failures. The Cubs started the season on a tear, and led the newly created National League East for 105 days. By mid-August they had a seemingly insurmountable {{frac|9|1|2}} game cushion, and they appeared to be a shoo-in for their first postseason appearance in 25 years. However, they floundered down the stretch, and finished eight games behind the \"[[1969 New York Mets season|Miracle Mets]]\".\n\nIn a mid-July series against the Mets, the Cubs were beaten in the first two games at [[Shea Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1969/VCHN01969.htm |title=The 1969 Chicago Cubs Game Log |publisher=Retrosheet.org |date= |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> but finally managed to salvage the third game, after which Durocher was asked if those were the real Cubs.\n\n'\"No\", Durocher answered, \"those are the real Mets.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWhile with the Cubs, Durocher encountered a difficult dilemma in regard to aging superstar [[Ernie Banks]]. While Banks' bad knees made him a liability, his legendary status made benching him impossible. Durocher also nearly came to blows with Cubs star [[Ron Santo]] during an infamous clubhouse near-riot. The problems were symbolic of Durocher's difficulty in managing the new breed of wealthier, more outspoken players who had come up during his long career. With a mediocre record of 46-44, Durocher was fired midway through the [[1972 in baseball|1972 season]], later stating that his greatest regret in baseball was not being able to win a pennant for longtime Cubs owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]].\n\n==Houston Astros and beyond==\nDurocher managed the [[Houston Astros]] for the final 31 games of the 1972 season (posting a 16\u201315 record in that span) and the entire 1973 season (posting an 82\u201380 record) before retiring.\n\nHe made a brief comeback in 1976 in the Japanese [[Pacific League]] with the [[Taiheiyo Club Lions]], but he retired due to illness ([[hepatitis]]) before the beginning of the season.<ref>Markus, Robert.

He posted a winning record with each of the four teams he led, and was the first manager to win 500 games with three different clubs.\n\nDurocher, with Ed Linn, wrote a memoir titled ''Nice Guys Finish Last'', a book that was recently re-published by the [[University of Chicago Press]].\n\nLeo Durocher died in 1991 in [[Palm Springs, California]] at the age of 86, and is buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. He was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\n==Personal life==\nDurocher was married four times. He was married to Ruby Hartley from 1930 to 1934. He was married to [[St. Louis]] socialite Grace Dozier from 1934 to 1943. In 1947 he married actress [[Laraine Day]], and they divorced in 1960. His fourth wife was Lynne Walker Goldblatt, to whom he was married from 1969 to 1980.<ref>{{cite news | title=Durocher, 62, Is Married To Prominent Chicagoan, 40 | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/06/20/78352383.html?pageNumber=46 | accessdate=March 5, 2016 | agency=United Press International | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 20, 1969 | page=46}}</ref><ref>Oxford University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wnMRAQAAMAAJ&q=leo+durocher+divorce+goldblatt&dq=leo+durocher+divorce+goldblatt&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LjYBU8rCC8blyAG9vYH4DQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg American National Biography: Dubuque-Fishbein], 1999, page 158.</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Durocher was deemed ineligible for service in [[World War II]] due to a [[punctured eardrum]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dickson |first1=Paul |title=Leo Durocher: Baseball's Prodigal Son |date=2017 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-63286-312-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQRRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT97&lpg=PT97#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=25 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWith Ruby Hartley, Durocher had a daughter named Barbara (born 1931).<ref>Doug Feldmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u1I3hJOIuo8C&pg=PA200&dq=leo+durocher+daughter+barbara&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nzYBU-iFB8PmyQGSiYHwDg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=leo%20durocher%20daughter%20barbara&f=false ''Dizzy and the Gas House Gang: The 1934 St. Louis Cardinals and Depression-Era Baseball''], 2000, page 51</ref>\n\nHe adopted two children with Day, daughter Melinda Michele (1944\u20132012)<ref>Coeur d'Alene Press, [http://www.cdapress.com/obituaries/article_24ac19fa-df2c-5f37-8c2a-b2e4b6a6349a.html Obituary, Melinda Michele Thompson-Durocher], May 30, 2012</ref> and son Chris (born 1945).<ref>LIFE Magazine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6E4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=%22leo+durocher%22+son+christopher&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rDkBU_fPKai9yAH4mIG4Ag&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22leo%20durocher%22%20son%20christopher&f=false Lippy's Loaded], April 2, 1951, page 45</ref><ref>Tim McCarver, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EYukP2zp56gC&q=%22leo+durocher%22+adopted+chris&dq=%22leo+durocher%22+adopted+chris&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7DoBU4G-PMqCygG--4CYBQ&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAQ Tim McCarver's Diamond Gems], 2008</ref> [[Willie Mays]] used to babysit Chris on Giants' roadtrips\u2014the two would room together and go see movies as well.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mays|first=Willie|title=Say Hey: The Autobiography of Willie Mays|location=New York|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1988|isbn=0671632922|page=77}}</ref>\n\nDurocher had real comedic talent, and portrayed himself on episodes of ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'', ''[[Mister Ed]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'', and other shows''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244266/|title=Leo Durocher|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> \n\nIn the 2013 film ''[[42 (film)|42]]'' about [[Jackie Robinson]], Durocher is played by [[Christopher Meloni]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/meloni-plays-hard-fiery-manager-durocher-42-article-1.1313826 | title=Christopher Meloni channels his inner loudmouth as Dodgers skipper Leo Durocher in '42' | first=Bruce | last=Fretts | date=April 12, 2013 | work=[[New York Daily News]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Leo Durocher}}\n* [[List of Major League Baseball player\u2013managers]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball managers by wins]]\n* [[The Victory Season: The End of World War II and the Birth of Baseball's Golden Age]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Nice Guys Finish Last'', by Leo Durocher with Ed Linn.

Both types of trading blocs are related to internal arrangements which parties conclude in order to liberalize and facilitate trade among themselves. The crucial difference between customs unions and free-trade areas is their approach to third parties.

In other words, the establishment of a free-trade area to grant preferential treatment among its member is legitimate under WTO law, but the parties to a free-trade area are not permitted to treat non-parties less favorably than before the area is established. A second requirement stipulated by Article XXIV is that tariffs and other barriers to trade must be eliminated to substantially all the trade within the free-trade are.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade |url=https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47.pdf |website=WTO |accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nFree trade agreements forming free-trade areas generally lie outside the realm of the multilateral trading system.

Whereas, ''trade creation'' implies that a free-trade area creates trade which may not have otherwise existed. In all cases trade creation will raise a country's national welfare.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Trade Theory and Policy |url=http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch110/T110-2A.php |website=Internationalecon |publisher=Steven Suvanovic |accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBoth trade creation and trade diversion are crucial effects found upon the establishment of a free-trade area. Trade creation will cause consumption to shift from a high-cost producer to a low-cost one, and trade will thus expand. In contrast, trade diversion will lead to trade shifting from a lower-cost producer outside the area to a higher-cost one inside the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanandres.esc.edu.ar/secondary/economics%20packs/international_economics/page_35.htm|title=Trade creation and trade diversion|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Such a shift will not benefit consumers within the free-trade area as they are deprived the opportunity to purchase cheaper imported goods. However, economists find that trade diversion does not always harm aggregate national welfare: it can even improve aggregate national welfare if the volume of diverted trade is small.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheong|first=Juyoung|date=2010|title=Free Trade Area and Welfare:Is A Bigger Trade Diversion More Detrimental?|url=http://www.etsg.org/ETSG2010/papers/Cheong.pdf|journal=ETSG 2010 Lausanne Twelfh Annual Conference|volume=|pages=|via=ETSG}}</ref>\n\n'''Free-trade areas as [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s'''\n\nEconomist have made attempts to evaluate the extent to which free-trade areas can be considered public goods. They firstly address one key element of free-trade areas, which is the system of embedded tribunals which act as arbitrators in international trade disputes. This system as a force of clarification for existing statutes and international economic policies as affirmed in the trade treaties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mavroidis|first=Petros C.|date=2012-08-01|title=Free Lunches? WTO as Public Good, and the WTO's View of Public Goods|journal=European Journal of International Law|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=731\u2013742|doi=10.1093/ejil/chs055|issn=0938-5428}}</ref>\n\nThe second way in which free-trade areas are considered public goods is tied to the evolving trend of them becoming \u201cdeeper\u201d. The depth of a free-trade area refers to the added types of structural policies that it covers. While older trade deals are deemed \u201cshallower\u201d as they cover fewer areas (such as tariffs and quotas), more recently concluded agreements address a number of other fields, from services to e-commerce and data localization. Since transactions among parties to a free-trade area are relatively cheaper as compared to those with non-parties, free-trade areas are conventionally found to be excludable. Now that deep trade deals will enhance regulatory harmonization and increase trade flows with non-parties, thus reduce the excludability of FTA benefits, new generation free-trade areas are obtaining essential characteristics public goods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/trade-effects-deep-agreements|title=Deep trade agreements as public goods|last=Mattoo|first=Aaditya|last2=Mulabdic|first2=Alen|date=2017-10-12|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2019-03-12|last3=Ruta|first3=Michele}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifying for preferences under a free-trade area==\n\n{{Further|Rules of origin}}\n\nUnlike a [[customs union]], parties to a free-trade area do not maintain common external tariffs, which means they apply different customs duties, as well as other policies with respect to non-members. This feature creates the possibility of non-parties may free-riding preferences under a free-trade area by penetrating the market with the lowest external tariffs.

Both types of trading blocs are related to internal arrangements which parties conclude in order to liberalize and facilitate trade among themselves. The crucial difference between customs unions and free-trade areas is their approach to third parties. While a customs union requires all parties to establish and maintain identical external tariffs with regard to trade with non-parties, parties to a free-trade area are not subject to such requirement. Instead, they may establish and maintain whatever tariff regime applying to imports from non-parties as deemed necessary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Anne|date=1995|title=Free Trade Agreements versus Customs Unions|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w5084.pdf|journal=NBER Working Paper No. 5084|volume=|pages=|via=NBER}}</ref> In a free-trade area without harmonized external tariffs, to eliminate the risk of trade deflection, parties will adopt a system of preferential [[rules of origin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://findrulesoforigin.org/glossary/glossary_roo|title=Rules of Origin Facilitator|last=|first=|date=|website=ITC|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the term ''free-trade area'', it is originally meant by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) to include only trade in goods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/regatt_e.htm|title=The basic rules for goods|last=|first=|date=|website=WTO|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> An agreement with a similar purpose, i.e., to enhance liberalization of trade in services, is named under Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Service (GATS) as an \"economic integration agreement\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/26-gats_01_e.htm#articleV|title=General Agreement on Trade in Services|last=|first=|date=|website=WTO|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, in practice, the term is now widely used to refer to agreements covering not only goods but also services and even investment.\n\n== Legal aspects of free-trade areas ==\n\n'''The''' formation of free-trade areas is considered an exception to the [[Most favoured nation|most favored nation]] (MFN) principle in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) because the preferences that parties to a free-trade area exclusively grant each other go beyond their accession commitments.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most-Favored-Nation Treatment Principle |url=https://www.meti.go.jp/english/report/data/2015WTO/02_01.pdf |website=METI |accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref> Although Article XXIV of the GATT allows WTO members to establish free-trade areas or to adopt interim agreements necessary for the establishment thereof, there are several conditions with respect to free-trade areas, or interim agreements leading to the formation of free-trade areas.\n\nFirstly, duties and other regulations maintained in each of the signatory parties to a free-trade area, which are applicable at the time such free-trade area is formed, to the trade with non-parties to such free-trade area shall not be higher or more restrictive than the corresponding duties and other regulations existing in the same signatory parties prior to the formation of the free-trade area. In other words, the establishment of a free-trade area to grant preferential treatment among its member is legitimate under WTO law, but the parties to a free-trade area are not permitted to treat non-parties less favorably than before the area is established.

Whereas, ''trade creation'' implies that a free-trade area creates trade which may not have otherwise existed. In all cases trade creation will raise a country's national welfare.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Trade Theory and Policy |url=http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch110/T110-2A.php |website=Internationalecon |publisher=Steven Suvanovic |accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBoth trade creation and trade diversion are crucial effects found upon the establishment of a free-trade area. Trade creation will cause consumption to shift from a high-cost producer to a low-cost one, and trade will thus expand. In contrast, trade diversion will lead to trade shifting from a lower-cost producer outside the area to a higher-cost one inside the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanandres.esc.edu.ar/secondary/economics%20packs/international_economics/page_35.htm|title=Trade creation and trade diversion|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Such a shift will not benefit consumers within the free-trade area as they are deprived the opportunity to purchase cheaper imported goods. However, economists find that trade diversion does not always harm aggregate national welfare: it can even improve aggregate national welfare if the volume of diverted trade is small.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheong|first=Juyoung|date=2010|title=Free Trade Area and Welfare:Is A Bigger Trade Diversion More Detrimental?|url=http://www.etsg.org/ETSG2010/papers/Cheong.pdf|journal=ETSG 2010 Lausanne Twelfh Annual Conference|volume=|pages=|via=ETSG}}</ref>\n\n'''Free-trade areas as [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s'''\n\nEconomist have made attempts to evaluate the extent to which free-trade areas can be considered public goods. They firstly address one key element of free-trade areas, which is the system of embedded tribunals which act as arbitrators in international trade disputes. This system as a force of clarification for existing statutes and international economic policies as affirmed in the trade treaties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mavroidis|first=Petros C.|date=2012-08-01|title=Free Lunches?

The depth of a free-trade area refers to the added types of structural policies that it covers. While older trade deals are deemed \u201cshallower\u201d as they cover fewer areas (such as tariffs and quotas), more recently concluded agreements address a number of other fields, from services to e-commerce and data localization. Since transactions among parties to a free-trade area are relatively cheaper as compared to those with non-parties, free-trade areas are conventionally found to be excludable. Now that deep trade deals will enhance regulatory harmonization and increase trade flows with non-parties, thus reduce the excludability of FTA benefits, new generation free-trade areas are obtaining essential characteristics public goods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/trade-effects-deep-agreements|title=Deep trade agreements as public goods|last=Mattoo|first=Aaditya|last2=Mulabdic|first2=Alen|date=2017-10-12|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2019-03-12|last3=Ruta|first3=Michele}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifying for preferences under a free-trade area==\n\n{{Further|Rules of origin}}\n\nUnlike a [[customs union]], parties to a free-trade area do not maintain common external tariffs, which means they apply different customs duties, as well as other policies with respect to non-members. This feature creates the possibility of non-parties may free-riding preferences under a free-trade area by penetrating the market with the lowest external tariffs. Such risk necessitates the introduction of rules to determine originating goods eligible for preferences under a free-trade area, a need that does not arise upon the formation of a customs union.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/rules-origin|title=Rules of origin|last=|first=|date=|website=Institute for Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Basically, there is a requirement for a minimum extent of processing that results in \"substantial transformation\" to the goods so that they can be considered originating.
