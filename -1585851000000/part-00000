and symptoms==\nEpisodes of vasovagal syncope are typically recurrent and usually occur when the predisposed person is exposed to a specific trigger. Before losing consciousness, the individual frequently experiences early signs or symptoms such as [[lightheadedness]], nausea, the feeling of being extremely hot or cold (accompanied by sweating), [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], an uncomfortable feeling in the heart, fuzzy thoughts, confusion, a slight inability to speak or form words (sometimes combined with mild stuttering), weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright, fuzzy or tunnel vision, black cloud-like spots in vision, and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well. The symptoms may become more intense over several seconds to several minutes before the loss of consciousness (if it is lost). Onset usually occurs when a person is sitting up or standing. Another possible cause is excessively quick consumption of ice cream, such as the McFlurry.\n\nWhen people lose consciousness, they fall down (unless prevented from doing so) and, when in this position, effective blood flow to the brain is immediately restored, allowing the person to regain consciousness. If the person does not fall into a fully flat, supine position, and the head remains elevated above the trunk, a state similar to a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] may result from the blood's inability to return quickly to the brain, and the neurons in the body will fire off and generally cause muscles to twitch very slightly but mostly remain very tense.\n\nThe [[autonomic nervous system]]'s physiological state (see below) leading to loss of consciousness may persist for several minutes, so\n* If sufferers try to sit or stand when they wake up, they may pass out again\n* The person may be nauseated, pale, and sweaty for several minutes or hours\n\n==Cause==\nReflex syncope occurs in response to a trigger due to dysfunction of the heart rate and blood pressure regulating mechanism. When heart rate slows or blood pressure drops, the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/dxc-20184778 |title=Vasovagal syncope: Causes |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=7 August 2010  |url-status=live |access-date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Vasovagal syncope===\nTypical triggers include:\n* Prolonged standing<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Emotional stress<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Pain<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* The sight of blood<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Time varying magnetic field<ref name=Rossi>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rossi S, Hallett M, Rossini PM, Pascual-Leone A |title=Safety, ethical considerations, and application guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=120 |issue=12 |pages=2008\u20132039 |year=2009 |pmid=19833552 |pmc=3260536 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016|hdl=11572/145680 }}</ref> (i.e. [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]])\n\n===Situational syncope===\n* After or during urination ([[micturition syncope]])<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Straining, such as to have a bowel movement<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Coughing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Swallowing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Lifting a heavy weight<ref name=Ad2017/>\n\n===Carotid sinus syncope===\nPressing upon a certain spot in the neck.<ref name=NIH2017/> This may happen when wearing a tight collar, shaving, or turning the head.<ref name=NIH2017/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nRegardless of the trigger, the mechanism of syncope is similar in the various vasovagal syncope syndromes. The [[nucleus tractus solitarii]] of the [[brainstem]] is activated directly or indirectly by the triggering stimulus, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of [[parasympathetic nervous system]] ([[vagal]]) tone and withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n\nThis results in a spectrum of hemodynamic responses:\n# On one end of the spectrum is the cardioinhibitory response, characterized by a drop in heart rate (negative [[chronotropic]] effect) and in contractility (negative [[inotropic]] effect) leading to a decrease in cardiac output that is significant enough to result in a loss of consciousness. It is thought that this response results primarily from enhancement in [[parasympathetic tone]].\n# On the other end of the spectrum is the vasodepressor response, caused by a drop in blood pressure (to as low as 80/20) without much change in heart rate. This phenomenon occurs due to [[vasodilation|dilation of the blood vessels]], probably as a result of withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n# The majority of people with vasovagal syncope have a mixed response somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum.\n\nOne account for these physiological responses is the [[Bezold-Jarisch reflex]].\n\nVasovagal syncope may be an evolution response, specifically the [[fight-or-flight response]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal syncope in humans and protective reactions in animals|date=2015|vauthors=Blanc JJ, Alboni P, Benditt DG|pmid=25662986|doi=10.1093/europace/euu367|volume=17|issue=3|journal=Europace|pages=345\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal Syncope As A Manifestation Of An Evolutionary Selected Trait|journal=Journal of Atrial Fibrillation|date=2014|vauthors=Alboni P, Alboni M|pmc=5135249|pmid=27957092|doi=10.4022/jafib.1035|volume=7|issue=2|page=1035|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIn addition to the mechanism described above, a number of other medical conditions may cause [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].

Sports drinks or drinks with electrolytes may be helpful.\n* People should be educated on how to respond to further episodes of syncope, especially if they experience [[prodrome|prodromal]] warning signs: they should lie down and raise their legs, or at least lower their head to increase blood flow to the brain. At the very least, upon the onset of initial symptoms the patient should try to relocate to a 'safe', perhaps cushioned, location in case of losing consciousness. Positioning themselves in a way where the impact from falling or collapsing would be minimized is ideal. The 'safe' area should be within close proximity, since, time is of the essence and these symptoms usually climax to loss of consciousness within a matter of minutes. If the individual has lost consciousness, he or she should be laid down with his or her head turned to the side. Tight clothing should be loosened. If the inciting factor is known, it should be removed if possible (for instance, the cause of pain).\n* Wearing graded compression stockings may be helpful.\n\n===Medications===\n* Certain [[medications]] may  also be helpful:\n** [[Beta blocker]]s (\u03b2-adrenergic antagonists) were once the most common medication given; however, they have been shown to be ineffective in a variety of studies and are thus no longer prescribed.

syncope affects at least 1 per 1,000 people a year.<ref name=Ay2010/> It is the most common type of [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], making up more than 50% of all cases.<ref name=Ad2017/>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nEpisodes of vasovagal syncope are typically recurrent and usually occur when the predisposed person is exposed to a specific trigger. Before losing consciousness, the individual frequently experiences early signs or symptoms such as [[lightheadedness]], nausea, the feeling of being extremely hot or cold (accompanied by sweating), [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], an uncomfortable feeling in the heart, fuzzy thoughts, confusion, a slight inability to speak or form words (sometimes combined with mild stuttering), weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright, fuzzy or tunnel vision, black cloud-like spots in vision, and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well. The symptoms may become more intense over several seconds to several minutes before the loss of consciousness (if it is lost). Onset usually occurs when a person is sitting up or standing.\n\nWhen people lose consciousness, they fall down (unless prevented from doing so) and, when in this position, effective blood flow to the brain is immediately restored, allowing the person to regain consciousness. If the person does not fall into a fully flat, supine position, and the head remains elevated above the trunk, a state similar to a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] may result from the blood's inability to return quickly to the brain, and the neurons in the body will fire off and generally cause muscles to twitch very slightly but mostly remain very tense.\n\nThe [[autonomic nervous system]]'s physiological state (see below) leading to loss of consciousness may persist for several minutes, so\n* If sufferers try to sit or stand when they wake up, they may pass out again\n* The person may be nauseated, pale, and sweaty for several minutes or hours\n\n==Cause==\nReflex syncope occurs in response to a trigger due to dysfunction of the heart rate and blood pressure regulating mechanism. When heart rate slows or blood pressure drops, the resulting lack of blood to the brain causes fainting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/dxc-20184778 |title=Vasovagal syncope: Causes |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=7 August 2010  |url-status=live |access-date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Vasovagal syncope===\nTypical triggers include:\n* Prolonged standing<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Emotional stress<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Pain<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* The sight of blood<ref name=NIH2017/>\n* Time varying magnetic field<ref name=Rossi>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rossi S, Hallett M, Rossini PM, Pascual-Leone A |title=Safety, ethical considerations, and application guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=120 |issue=12 |pages=2008\u20132039 |year=2009 |pmid=19833552 |pmc=3260536 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016|hdl=11572/145680 }}</ref> (i.e. [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]])\n\n===Situational syncope===\n* After or during urination ([[micturition syncope]])<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Straining, such as to have a bowel movement<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Coughing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Swallowing<ref name=Ad2017/>\n* Lifting a heavy weight<ref name=Ad2017/>\n\n===Carotid sinus syncope===\nPressing upon a certain spot in the neck.<ref name=NIH2017/> This may happen when wearing a tight collar, shaving, or turning the head.<ref name=NIH2017/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nRegardless of the trigger, the mechanism of syncope is similar in the various vasovagal syncope syndromes. The [[nucleus tractus solitarii]] of the [[brainstem]] is activated directly or indirectly by the triggering stimulus, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of [[parasympathetic nervous system]] ([[vagal]]) tone and withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n\nThis results in a spectrum of hemodynamic responses:\n# On one end of the spectrum is the cardioinhibitory response, characterized by a drop in heart rate (negative [[chronotropic]] effect) and in contractility (negative [[inotropic]] effect) leading to a decrease in cardiac output that is significant enough to result in a loss of consciousness. It is thought that this response results primarily from enhancement in [[parasympathetic tone]].\n# On the other end of the spectrum is the vasodepressor response, caused by a drop in blood pressure (to as low as 80/20) without much change in heart rate. This phenomenon occurs due to [[vasodilation|dilation of the blood vessels]], probably as a result of withdrawal of [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone.\n# The majority of people with vasovagal syncope have a mixed response somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum.\n\nOne account for these physiological responses is the [[Bezold-Jarisch reflex]].\n\nVasovagal syncope may be an evolution response, specifically the [[fight-or-flight response]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal syncope in humans and protective reactions in animals|date=2015|vauthors=Blanc JJ, Alboni P, Benditt DG|pmid=25662986|doi=10.1093/europace/euu367|volume=17|issue=3|journal=Europace|pages=345\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Vasovagal Syncope As A Manifestation Of An Evolutionary Selected Trait|journal=Journal of Atrial Fibrillation|date=2014|vauthors=Alboni P, Alboni M|pmc=5135249|pmid=27957092|doi=10.4022/jafib.1035|volume=7|issue=2|page=1035|doi-broken-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIn addition to the mechanism described above, a number of other medical conditions may cause [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].

Sports drinks or drinks with electrolytes may be helpful.\n* People should be educated on how to respond to further episodes of syncope, especially if they experience [[prodrome|prodromal]] warning signs: they should lie down and raise their legs, or at least lower their head to increase blood flow to the brain. At the very least, upon the onset of initial symptoms the patient should try to relocate to a 'safe', perhaps cushioned, location in case of losing consciousness. Positioning themselves in a way where the impact from falling or collapsing would be minimized is ideal. The 'safe' area should be within close proximity, since, time is of the essence and these symptoms usually climax to loss of consciousness within a matter of minutes. If the individual has lost consciousness, he or she should be laid down with his or her head turned to the side. Tight clothing should be loosened. If the inciting factor is known, it should be removed if possible (for instance, the cause of pain).\n* Wearing graded compression stockings may be helpful.\n\n===Medications===\n* Certain [[medications]] may  also be helpful:\n** [[Beta blocker]]s (\u03b2-adrenergic antagonists) were once the most common medication given; however, they have been shown to be ineffective in a variety of studies and are thus no longer prescribed.

The departure of a trusted staff member with access to sensitive information can become a data breach if the staff member retains access to the data after termination of the trust relationship.  In distributed systems, this can also occur with a breakdown in a [[web of trust]].

Loss of corporate information such as [[trade secret]]s, sensitive corporate information, and details of [[contract]]s, or of government information is frequently unreported, as there is no compelling reason to do so in the absence of potential damage to private citizens, and the publicity around such an event may be more damaging than the loss of the data itself.\n\n==Insider versus external threats==\nThose working inside an organization are a major cause of data breaches.

Initiated by architect [[L\u00e9on Krier]] in the spirit of the [[New Urbanism|urban village]], it enjoys the keen endorsement of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], on whose land it is built ([[Duchy of Cornwall]]). Due for completion in 2025, it is expected to house a population of 6,000. Poundbury currently provides employment for over 2,000 people in over 180 businesses.\n\nPoundbury has been praised for reviving the low-rise streetscape built to the human scale, and for echoing traditional local design features. But it has also been criticised as artificially nostalgic, and it has not succeeded in reducing car dependence.\n\n==Mission==\nPoundbury has been built according to the principles of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], who is known for holding strong views challenging the [[post-war]] trends in [[town planning]] that were suburban in character. Since starting in 1993, the town has received both criticism and praise from architects and design critics.\n\nThe development is built to a traditional high-density urban pattern, rather than a suburban one, focused on creating an integrated community of shops, businesses, and private and [[social housing]]. There is no [[zoning]]. The planners say they are designing the development around people rather than the car, and they aim to provide a high-quality environment, from the architecture to the selection of materials, to the signposts, and the [[landscaping]]. To avoid constant construction, utilities are buried in [[common utility duct]]s under the town. Common areas are maintained by a management company to which all residents belong. It consists of 35 percent social housing and is designed for [[sustainable development]],<ref>{{cite news |title=About Poundbury |url=http://www.poundburycommercial.com/about-poundbury/ |accessdate=15 July 2018 |publisher=www.poundburycommercial.com}}</ref> which includes [[carbon neutrality]].<ref>Pentreath, Ben, ''[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/94e6c310-3c8f-11e3-a8c4-00144feab7de.html How the Poundbury project became a model for innovation]'', ''Financial Times'', 1 November 2013</ref>\n\nTo some degree, the project shows similarities with the contemporary [[New Urbanism]] movement.

Initiated by architect [[L\u00e9on Krier]] in the spirit of the [[New Urbanism|urban village]], it enjoys the keen endorsement of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], on whose land it is built ([[Duchy of Cornwall]]). Due for completion in 2025, it is expected to house a population of 6,000. Poundbury currently provides employment for over 2,000 people in over 180 businesses.\n\nPoundbury has been praised for reviving the low-rise streetscape built to the human scale, and for echoing traditional local design features. But it has also been criticised as artificially nostalgic, and it has not succeeded in reducing car dependence.\n\n==Mission==\nPoundbury has been built according to the principles of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], who is known for holding strong views challenging the [[post-war]] trends in [[town planning]] that were suburban in character. Since starting in 1993, the town has received both criticism and praise from architects and design critics.\n\nThe development is built to a traditional high-density urban pattern, rather than a suburban one, focused on creating an integrated community of shops, businesses, and private and [[social housing]]. There is no [[zoning]]. The planners say they are designing the development around people rather than the car, and they aim to provide a high-quality environment, from the architecture to the selection of materials, to the signposts, and the [[landscaping]]. To avoid constant construction, utilities are buried in [[common utility duct]]s under the town. Common areas are maintained by a management company to which all residents belong. It consists of 35 percent social housing and is designed for [[sustainable development]],<ref>{{cite news |title=About Poundbury |url=http://www.poundburycommercial.com/about-poundbury/ |accessdate=15 July 2018 |publisher=www.poundburycommercial.com}}</ref> which includes [[carbon neutrality]].<ref>Pentreath, Ben, ''[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/94e6c310-3c8f-11e3-a8c4-00144feab7de.html How the Poundbury project became a model for innovation]'', ''Financial Times'', 1 November 2013</ref>\n\nTo some degree, the project shows similarities with the contemporary [[New Urbanism]] movement.

Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.

Former Pentagon intelligence analyst [[Marc Garlasco]] suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by [[Hydra 70]] rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \"squirters\"\u2014people perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack.

Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.

Single stranded [[RNA virus]]es are classified as positive or negative depending on the sense or polarity of the RNA. The negative viral RNA is complementary to the [[mRNA]] and must be converted to a positive RNA by [[RNA replicase|RNA polymerase]] before [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. Therefore, the purified RNA of a negative sense virus is not infectious by itself, as it needs to be converted to a positive sense RNA for replication. These viruses belong to Group V on the [[Baltimore classification]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baltimore|first1=D|title=Expression of animal virus genomes|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|date=1971|volume=35|issue=3|pages=235\u2013241|pmc=378387|pmid=4329869|doi=10.1128/MMBR.35.3.235-241.1971}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses have complex genomic sequences, cell cycles, and replication habits that use various [[protein]] complexes to arrange in specific conformations and carry out necessary processes for survival and reproduction of their [[Genome|genomic sequence]]s. The complexity of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses carries into its ability to suppress the [[Innate immune system|innate immune]] response of the cells it infects and the construction of a [[capsid]], which is unique to the varying classifications of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\n==Replication==\nNegative sense ssRNA viruses need RNA polymerase to form a positive sense RNA. The positive-sense RNA acts as a viral mRNA, which is translated into [[proteins]] for the production of new [[virion]] materials. With the newly formed virions, more negative sense RNA molecules are produced.\n\nIn more details, replication of the virion consists of the following steps:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Samuel|first1=Charles E|title=Virus-Host Interaction Minireview Series: Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, and Influenza Virus|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=2005|volume=281|issue=13|pages=8305\u20137 |pmid=16407181 |doi=10.1074/jbc.R500032200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hofkin|first1=Bruce|title=Living in a Microbial World|date=2010|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=9780815341758}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Rybicki|first1=Ed|title=Viral Replication Strategy in Negative-Sense Single-Stranded RNA Viruses|url=http://www.microbelibrary.org/library/virus/2768-viral-replication-strategy-in-negative-sense-single-stranded-rna-viruses|website=ASM Microbe Library|publisher=American Society for Microbiology|accessdate=14 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023235735/http://www.microbelibrary.org/library/virus/2768-viral-replication-strategy-in-negative-sense-single-stranded-rna-viruses|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n#  A virion enters the host cell and releases its negative RNA into the [[cytoplasm]].\n# The virus uses its own [[RNA replicase]], also known as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), to form positive RNA template strands through complementary base pairing.\n# The positive RNA acts as mRNA, which is translated into structural [[capsomere]] proteins and viral RdRp by the host's [[ribosomes]].\n# A replicative complex is formed with RdRp: The positive strands can either function as mRNA to produce more proteins or as template to make more negative RNA strands.\n# New viral [[capsids]] are assembled with the capsomere proteins. The negative RNA strands combine with capsids and viral RdRp to form new negative RNA virions. \n# After assembly and maturation of nucleocapsid, the new virions exit the cell by budding or lysing through [[cell membrane]] to further infect other cells.\n\nThe [[genome]] size of a negative RNA virus is between 10kb to 30kb. Two genome subgroups can be distinguished, nonsegmented and segmented, and are described as such:\n\n*In viruses with nonsegmented genomes, the first step of replication is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the negative strand by RdRp to form various monocistronic mRNA that code for individual viral proteins. A positive strand copy is formed to serve as template for the production of the negative genome. This replication takes place in the cytoplasm.\n*In viruses with segmented genomes, replication occurs in the nucleus and the RdRp produces one monocistronic mRNA strand from each genome segment. The principal difference between the two types is the location of replication.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nOne phylum, two subphyla, six classes, eight orders and twenty one families are currently recognised in this group.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cann|first1=Alan |title=Principles of Molecular Virology|year=2011 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-384939-7}}</ref> A number of unassigned species and genera are yet to be classified.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Klein, Donald W. |author2=Prescott, Lansing M. |author3=Harley, John |title=Microbiology |publisher=Wm.

This process halts the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway, just like preventing phosphorylation of TYK2 and JAK1.\n\nFurther down the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway, STAT1 and [[STAT2]] are transported across the [[nuclear membrane]], as depicted in the image.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> They accordingly bind to the DNA sequence and behave as [[transcription factor]]s- affecting the level of [[gene]] production throughout the cell.

One important element of NSVs is that the capsid [[protein]] (N) is first synthesized as a [[monomer]]ic protein (N0). N0 is a capsid protein that assembles a capsid to accommodate any RNA sequence. N0 is kept monomeric in different ways depending on which family of NSVs a virus falls into. For instance, rhabdoviruses keep the N0 monomeric by forming a complex with the [[phosphoprotein]] (P).<ref name=\":7\" /> It has been found that both the N- and C terminal regions of P bind to the capsid protein. Essentially, the P binding occupies the site required for N0 [[oligomer]]ization. Other viruses, such as bunyaviruses, simply sequester the [[N-terminus|N terminus]] by N itself. Nonetheless, it is essential for N to be monomeric for the NSV to be competent in encapsidating viral RNA.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn terms of the structure of the nucleocapsid, the N protein will eventually oligomerize to encapsidate the single-stranded RNA. In some NSVs the N subunits are oriented in a parallel orientation, and the ssRNA is sequestered in the center. In most NSVs, the nucleocapsid appears to be a random coil, and the symmetry is linear.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruigrok|first=Rob WH|last2=Cr\u00e9pin|first2=Thibaut|last3=Kolakofsky|first3=Dan|title=Nucleoproteins and nucleocapsids of negative-strand RNA viruses|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=14|issue=4|pages=504\u2013510|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.011|pmid=21824806|year=2011}}</ref> Because the N subunits are oriented in a parallel fashion, the cross-molecular interactions among the subunits stabilize the nucleocapsid and are critical for capsid formation.

Single stranded [[RNA virus]]es are classified as positive or negative depending on the sense or polarity of the RNA. The negative viral RNA is complementary to the [[mRNA]] and must be converted to a positive RNA by [[RNA replicase|RNA polymerase]] before [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. Therefore, the purified RNA of a negative sense virus is not infectious by itself, as it needs to be converted to a positive sense RNA for replication. These viruses belong to Group V on the [[Baltimore classification]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baltimore|first1=D|title=Expression of animal virus genomes|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|date=1971|volume=35|issue=3|pages=235\u2013241|pmc=378387|pmid=4329869|doi=10.1128/MMBR.35.3.235-241.1971}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses have complex genomic sequences, cell cycles, and replication habits that use various [[protein]] complexes to arrange in specific conformations and carry out necessary processes for survival and reproduction of their [[Genome|genomic sequence]]s. The complexity of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses carries into its ability to suppress the [[Innate immune system|innate immune]] response of the cells it infects and the construction of a [[capsid]], which is unique to the varying classifications of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\n==Replication==\nNegative sense ssRNA viruses need RNA polymerase to form a positive sense RNA. The positive-sense RNA acts as a viral mRNA, which is translated into [[proteins]] for the production of new [[virion]] materials.

The negative RNA strands combine with capsids and viral RdRp to form new negative RNA virions. \n# After assembly and maturation of nucleocapsid, the new virions exit the cell by budding or lysing through [[cell membrane]] to further infect other cells.\n\nThe [[genome]] size of a negative RNA virus is between 10kb to 30kb. Two genome subgroups can be distinguished, nonsegmented and segmented, and are described as such:\n\n*In viruses with nonsegmented genomes, the first step of replication is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the negative strand by RdRp to form various monocistronic mRNA that code for individual viral proteins. A positive strand copy is formed to serve as template for the production of the negative genome. This replication takes place in the cytoplasm.\n*In viruses with segmented genomes, replication occurs in the nucleus and the RdRp produces one monocistronic mRNA strand from each genome segment.

This process halts the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway, just like preventing phosphorylation of TYK2 and JAK1.\n\nFurther down the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway, STAT1 and [[STAT2]] are transported across the [[nuclear membrane]], as depicted in the image.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> They accordingly bind to the DNA sequence and behave as [[transcription factor]]s- affecting the level of [[gene]] production throughout the cell.  In normal cellular function, this pathway will behave normally in response to [[Viral disease|viral infection]], leading to the production of antiviral genes and the induction of an immune response.<ref name=\":2\" />  However, NNSVs have developed the capability to generate complexes that target the protein responsible for translocating STAT1 across the nuclear membrane. By binding to and inhibiting this function, STAT1 is never able to bind to the DNA and properly regulate the production of antiviral genes.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> This pathway of inhibiting the IFN response helps the NNSV go undetected within the cell and avoid certain immune response pathways.\n\n== Ubiquitination ==\nAnother important process used throughout many cellular processes is [[ubiquitin]]ation\u2014which is outlined in the image below.

The [[Capsid|nucleocapsid]] of NSVs is assembled with a single nucleocapsid protein, and the viral [[RNA]]. Each NSV nucleocapsid is packaged inside a [[lipid]] envelope, but the appearance of the nucleocapsid differs from virus to virus.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Neumann|first=Gabriele|last2=Whitt|first2=Michael A.|last3=Kawaoka|first3=Yoshihiro|date=2002-11-01|title=A decade after the generation of a negative-sense RNA virus from cloned cDNA - what have we learned?|journal=The Journal of General Virology|volume=83|issue=Pt 11|pages=2635\u20132662|doi=10.1099/0022-1317-83-11-2635|issn=0022-1317|pmid=12388800}}</ref> For example, in rhabdoviruses, the nucleocapsid assumes a bullet shape,<ref name=\":7\" /> while in [[Paramyxoviridae|paramyxoviruses]], the nucleocapsid is [[Fiber|filamentous]] or herringbone-like.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loney|first=Colin|last2=Mottet-Osman|first2=Genevi\u00e8ve|last3=Roux|first3=Laurent|last4=Bhella|first4=David|date=2009-08-15|title=Paramyxovirus Ultrastructure and Genome Packaging: Cryo-Electron Tomography of Sendai Virus|journal=Journal of Virology|language=en|volume=83|issue=16|pages=8191\u20138197|doi=10.1128/JVI.00693-09|issn=0022-538X|pmc=2715783|pmid=19493999}}</ref> However, when the nucleocapsids are released from the virion, they all appear like a coil.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nSo far, the atomic structures of nucleocapsid-like-particles (NLP) have been elucidated for three NSV families: [[Rhabdoviridae]], [[Paramyxoviridae]], and [[Bunyaviridae]]. One important element of NSVs is that the capsid [[protein]] (N) is first synthesized as a [[monomer]]ic protein (N0). N0 is a capsid protein that assembles a capsid to accommodate any RNA sequence. N0 is kept monomeric in different ways depending on which family of NSVs a virus falls into. For instance, rhabdoviruses keep the N0 monomeric by forming a complex with the [[phosphoprotein]] (P).<ref name=\":7\" /> It has been found that both the N- and C terminal regions of P bind to the capsid protein. Essentially, the P binding occupies the site required for N0 [[oligomer]]ization. Other viruses, such as bunyaviruses, simply sequester the [[N-terminus|N terminus]] by N itself. Nonetheless, it is essential for N to be monomeric for the NSV to be competent in encapsidating viral RNA.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn terms of the structure of the nucleocapsid, the N protein will eventually oligomerize to encapsidate the single-stranded RNA. In some NSVs the N subunits are oriented in a parallel orientation, and the ssRNA is sequestered in the center. In most NSVs, the nucleocapsid appears to be a random coil, and the symmetry is linear.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ruigrok|first=Rob WH|last2=Cr\u00e9pin|first2=Thibaut|last3=Kolakofsky|first3=Dan|title=Nucleoproteins and nucleocapsids of negative-strand RNA viruses|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=14|issue=4|pages=504\u2013510|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.011|pmid=21824806|year=2011}}</ref> Because the N subunits are oriented in a parallel fashion, the cross-molecular interactions among the subunits stabilize the nucleocapsid and are critical for capsid formation. The linear interactions along the encapsidated single-stranded RNA are actually a unique feature to NSVs.<ref name=\":7\" /> [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray crystal structures]] of N proteins and [[Micrograph|EM micrographs]] of [[Ribonucleoprotein|RNP]] complexe[[Ribonucleoprotein|s]] from a number of [[Bunyaviridae]] (a Family of segmented NSVs that includes the [[Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus|Bunyamwera virus]] and the Schmallenberg virus) show that in these viruses the nucleocapsid adopts a helical arrangement where the N proteins form a head-to-tail chain by linking to each other via a flexible N-terminal arm. The resulting chain forms tight coils with four N proteins per turn that holds the circular ssRNA of these viruses on the inside of the coils and extend to form large circular filaments.<ref name=\":15\" />[[File:Structure_of_a_nucleocaspid.png|thumb|Structure of a Nucleocaspid]]\n\nThe process of [[encapsidation]] is a concomitant process with [[viral replication]], likely at the site of the viral RNA replication process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Todd J.|last2=Luo|first2=Ming|date=2009-07-14|title=Structure of the vesicular stomatitis virus nucleocapsid in complex with the nucleocapsid-binding domain of the small polymerase cofactor, P|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=28|pages=11713\u201311718|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903228106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2710649|pmid=19571006|bibcode=2009PNAS..10611713G}}</ref> Another unique feature of NSVs is that the sequestered bases are stacked to form a [[Sequence motif|motif]] similar to half of the [[A-DNA|A-form]] double helix of RNA. The stacking arrangement allows for maximized packaging of the RNA in the capsid.<ref name=\":7\" /> The base stacking may actually contribute to the overall stability of the nucleocapsid, and is dependent on the RNA sequence (i.e. poly(rA) is the most stable).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Todd J.|last2=Rowse|first2=Michael|last3=Tsao|first3=Jun|last4=Kang|first4=Jungsoon|last5=Ge|first5=Peng|last6=Zhou|first6=Z.

For translational termination, there is a U7 track at the end of each [[coding region]], causing this to be the least stable region. This therefore promotes dissociation of the transcription complex.<ref name=\":7\" /> A unique aspect of NSVs is the conserved (3H+5H) motif, which has been identified to constitute the RNA cavity through [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structur]]<nowiki/>e elements of the N protein.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Ming|last2=Green|first2=Todd J.|last3=Zhang|first3=Xin|last4=Tsao|first4=Jun|last5=Qiu|first5=Shihong|date=2007-01-01|title=Structural comparisons of the nucleoprotein from three negative strand RNA virus families|journal=Virology Journal|volume=4|pages=72|doi=10.1186/1743-422X-4-72|issn=1743-422X|pmc=2031895|pmid=17623082}}</ref>\n\nLastly, a main distinction between NSVs from other viruses is that the nucleocapsid actually serves as the template for viral [[Transcription (genetics)|RNA synthesis]]. During synthesis, the nucleocapsid undergoes a conformational change to release the RNA template. After transcription is complete, the RNA is repositioned in the cavity, and the nucleocapsid is restored.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus]]\n*[[Double-stranded RNA virus]]\n*[[Baltimore classification]]\n*[[Sense (molecular biology)]]\n\n==References==\n<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Chatterjee|first1=S|last2=Basler|first2=CF|last3=Amarasinghe|first3=GK|last4=Leung|first4=DW|title=Molecular Mechanisms of Innate Immune Inhibition by Non-Segmented Negative-Sense RNA Viruses.|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=28 August 2016|volume=428|issue=17|pages=3467\u201382|pmid=27487481|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2016.07.017|pmc=5010489}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=TJ|last2=Cox|first2=R|last3=Tsao|first3=J|last4=Rowse|first4=M|last5=Qiu|first5=S|last6=Luo|first6=M|title=Common mechanism for RNA encapsidation by negative-strand RNA viruses.|journal=Journal of Virology|date=April 2014|volume=88|issue=7|pages=3766\u201375|pmid=24429372|doi=10.1128/jvi.03483-13|pmc=3993539}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Ort\u00edn|first1=J|last2=Mart\u00edn-Benito|first2=J|title=The RNA synthesis machinery of negative-stranded RNA viruses.|journal=Virology|date=May 2015|volume=479\u2013480|pages=532\u201344|pmid=25824479|doi=10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.018}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=G|last2=Whitt|first2=MA|last3=Kawaoka|first3=Y|title=A decade after the generation of a negative-sense RNA virus from cloned cDNA - what have we learned?|journal=The Journal of General Virology|date=November 2002|volume=83|issue=Pt 11|pages=2635\u201362|pmid=12388800|doi=10.1099/0022-1317-83-11-2635}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Viswanathan|first1=K|last2=Fr\u00fch|first2=K|last3=DeFilippis|first3=V|title=Viral hijacking of the host ubiquitin system to evade interferon responses.|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|date=August 2010|volume=13|issue=4|pages=517\u201323|pmid=20699190|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2010.05.012|pmc=2939720}}</ref>\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mcb.uct.ac.za/tutorial/v.html Replication Strategy of ss(-)RNA Viruses]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses| ]]\n[[Category:Unaccepted virus taxa]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNSV segmented genomes:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative-sense_single-stranded_RNA_virus"}
