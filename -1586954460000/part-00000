The fox is also sometimes associated with [[Shapeshifting|transformation]]. This folkore is found in [[literature]], film, television, games, and music, and elsewhere.\n\nThe term \"[[wikt:foxy|foxy]]\" in English (\"having the qualities of a fox\") can also connote attractiveness, sexiness, or being red-haired. The term \"to [[wikt:outfox|outfox]]\" means \"to beat in a competition of wits\", similarly to \"outguess\", \"outsmart\", and \"outwit\".\n\n==In folklore and wisdom==\n===Africa===\nIn [[Dogon people|Dogon]] mythology, the fox<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewebsiteofeverything.com/animals/mammals/Carnivora/Canidae/Vulpes/Vulpes-pallida.html|title=Pale Fox - Mysterious Fox of the African Desert - pictures and facts|website=Thewebsiteofeverything.com}}</ref> is reported to be either the trickster god of the desert, who embodies chaos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.godchecker.com/african-mythology/OGO/|title=OGO - the Dogon God of Chaos (African mythology)|website=Godchecker.com}}</ref> or a messenger for the gods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/9039|title=Dogon restudied: A field evaluation of the work of Marcel Griaule|date=18 October 1991|website=Openaccess.leidenuniv.nl}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[Tswana people|Tswana]] riddle that says that ''\"Phokoje go tsela o dithetsenya'' [Only the muddy fox lives] meaning that, in a philosophical sense, 'only an active person who does not mind getting muddy gets to progress in life.'\n\n===Europe===\n[[Kuma Lisa]] is a female fox from [[Bulgarian folklore]] and [[Russian folklore]] who usually plays the role of the [[trickster]]. Kuma Lisa is encountered with another character known as [[Kumcho Vulcho]] - a [[wolf]] which is opposite to her and very often suffers from her tricks.\n\nIn [[Scotland]], the trickster figure of the fox (or ''tod'' in traditional [[Scots language|Scots]]) was represented as ''Lowrence'', as in the ''[[The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian|Morall Fabillis]]'' of [[Robert Henryson]].\n\nIn [[Finnish mythology]], the fox is depicted usually a cunning trickster, but seldom evil. The fox, while weaker, in the end outsmarts both the evil and voracious wolf and the strong but not-so-cunning bear. It symbolizes the victory of intelligence over both malevolence and brute strength. In Northern Finland the fox is said to conjure the aurora borealis while it runs through the snowy hills. When the fox\u2019s fur touches the snow it creates magical sparks and sets the sky ablaze. Still today the Finnish word for the aurora is \u201crevontulet\u201d which literally translates to \u201cfox fires\u201d.\n\nAn [[Occitan]] song dating from the Middle Ages, ''Ai Vis lo Lop'', features a wolf (''lo lop''), a fox (''lo rainard'') and a hare (''lebre'') dancing and circling a tree. It has been suggested that the three animals represent the King, Lord and Church who were responsible for taxation (the lyrics go on to refer to money gained over the year and how nothing was left after seeing 'the wolf, the fox and the hare').\n\nIn [[Europe]], in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], foxes, which were associated with wiliness and [[fraud]]ulent behavior, were sometimes burned as symbols of the [[Devil]].<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Benton\n  | first = Janetta Rebold\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings\n  | publisher = Abbeville Press\n  | date = 1 April 1997\n  | location = \n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/holyterrorsgargo00bent/page/82 82]\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/holyterrorsgargo00bent/page/82\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-0-7892-0182-9\n  }}</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\nIn early [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the fox is one of the sacred animals of the goddess [[Ninhursag]]. The fox acts as her messenger.\n\nThe [[Bible]]'s [[Song of Solomon]] (2:15) includes a well-known verse ''\"Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom\"'' which had been given many interpretations over the centuries by Jewish and Christian Bible commentators.\t\n\nTo the Jewish sage [[Matteya ben Heresh]], of the 2nd century CE, is attributed the maxim: \"Meet each man with friendly greeting; be the tail among lions rather than the head among foxes\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=11025|title=\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d6\u05e0\u05d1 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea, \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05ea\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd|website=Lib.cet.ac.il}}</ref> \"The head among foxes\" in this context is similar to the English expression \"A big fish in a small pond\". \"Fox fables\" are attributed to [[Rabbi Meir]] and [[Johanan ben Zakai]], and appeared in a large compilation by [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]]; the term in fact refers also to fables featuring animals other than foxes.\n\n===East Asia===\n[[File:Prince Hanzoku terrorised by a nine- tailed fox.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Prince Hanzoku]] terrorized by a nine-tailed kitsune (fox spirit).

In contemporary Chinese, the word ''huli jing'' is often used to describe a mistress negatively in an extramarital affair. In [[Shinto]] of Japan, kitsune sometimes helps people as an errand of their deity, [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]].\n\n===Americas===\nThe [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] worshiped animals and often depicted the fox in their art.<ref>Katherine Berrin & Larco Museum (1997). ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Rafael Larco Herrera]]''. New York: [[Thames and Hudson]].</ref> The Moche people believed the fox to be a warrior that would use his mind to fight. The fox would not ever use physical attack, only mental.\n\nIn the [[Uncle Remus]] collection of 19th-century [[African-American]] folktales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], \"[[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Br'er Fox]]\" is a major character, often acting as the [[antagonist]] towards the stories' main character, \"[[Br'er Rabbit]]\".\n\n==In language==\n===As an epithet===\nThe Medieval [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer [[Robert Guiscard]] was nicknamed ''\"Robert the Fox\"'' as well as ''the Resourceful'', ''the Cunning'', ''the Wily'' - underlining the identification of such qualities with foxes.\n\nDuring the [[The American Revolution]] Continental Army Officer [[Francis Marion]] became so adept at attacking and Ambushing British forces in the swamps of [[South Carolina]] that he became known as the \u201cSwamp Fox\u201d\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the German commander in North Africa, [[Erwin Rommel]], was grudgingly nicknamed the \"Desert Fox\" by his British adversaries, as a tribute to his cunning and skill in operational art.\n\nThe [[Italy|Italian]] sociologist and economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848\u20131923) in his ''Trattato di Sociologia Generale'' (1916) developed the concept of an [[elite]] [[social class]], which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the [[power (sociology)|power]] constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa.\n\n===Figures of speech===\nThe words ''fox'' and ''foxy'' have become slang in [[English language|English-speaking]] societies for an individual (most often female) with sex appeal. The word ''vixen'', which is normally the common name for a female fox, is also used to describe an attractive woman\u2014although, in the case of humans, \"vixen\" tends to imply that the woman in question has a few nasty qualities.\n\nThe word ''shenanigan'' (a deceitful [[confidence trick]], or [[mischief]]) is considered to be derived from the Irish expression ''sionnachuighim'', meaning \"''I play the fox''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourdictionary.com/shenanigan|title=Shenanigan dictionary definition &#124; shenanigan defined|website=Yourdictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n==Literature ==\n:''(in chronological order)''\n[[File:Obake Karuta 3-01.jpg|right|thumb|This Japanese ''[[karuta|obake karuta]]'' (monster card) from the early 19th century depicts a [[kitsune]] (fox spirit).

Both are con-men who lead Pinocchio astray and unsuccessfully attempt to murder him. They pretend to have disabilities - the Fox to lameness and the Cat to blindness. The Fox is the more articulate, the Cat usually limiting itself to repeating the Fox's words.\n* 1894 - \"Scrapefoot\". A tale with a fox as antagonist that bears striking similarities to [[Robert Southey]]'s \"The Story of the Three Bears\" was uncovered by the folklorist [[Joseph Jacobs]] and may predate Southey's version in the oral tradition. Some sources state that it was illustrator John D. Batten who in 1894 reported a variant of the tale at least 40 years old. In this version, the three bears live in a castle in the woods and are visited by a fox called Scrapefoot who drinks their milk, sits in their chairs, and rests in their beds.\n* 1905? - [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], ''The Biography of a Silver-Fox, Or, Domino Reynard of Goldur Town'': Realistic story with author's drawing, later made into a feature film.\n* 1909 - [[L.

The fox is also sometimes associated with [[Shapeshifting|transformation]]. This folkore is found in [[literature]], film, television, games, and music, and elsewhere.\n\nThe term \"[[wikt:foxy|foxy]]\" in English (\"having the qualities of a fox\") can also connote attractiveness, sexiness, or being red-haired.

Kuma Lisa is encountered with another character known as [[Kumcho Vulcho]] - a [[wolf]] which is opposite to her and very often suffers from her tricks.\n\nIn [[Scotland]], the trickster figure of the fox (or ''tod'' in traditional [[Scots language|Scots]]) was represented as ''Lowrence'', as in the ''[[The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian|Morall Fabillis]]'' of [[Robert Henryson]].\n\nIn [[Finnish mythology]], the fox is depicted usually a cunning trickster, but seldom evil. The fox, while weaker, in the end outsmarts both the evil and voracious wolf and the strong but not-so-cunning bear. It symbolizes the victory of intelligence over both malevolence and brute strength. In Northern Finland the fox is said to conjure the aurora borealis while it runs through the the snowy hills. When the fox\u2019s fur touches the snow it creates magical sparks and sets the sky ablaze. Still today the Finnish word for the aurora is \u201crevontulet\u201d which literally translates to \u201cfox fires\u201d.\n\nAn [[Occitan]] song dating from the Middle Ages, ''Ai Vis lo Lop'', features a wolf (''lo lop''), a fox (''lo rainard'') and a hare (''lebre'') dancing and circling a tree. It has been suggested that the three animals represent the King, Lord and Church who were responsible for taxation (the lyrics go on to refer to money gained over the year and how nothing was left after seeing 'the wolf, the fox and the hare').\n\nIn [[Europe]], in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], foxes, which were associated with wiliness and [[fraud]]ulent behavior, were sometimes burned as symbols of the [[Devil]].<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Benton\n  | first = Janetta Rebold\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings\n  | publisher = Abbeville Press\n  | date = 1 April 1997\n  | location = \n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/holyterrorsgargo00bent/page/82 82]\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/holyterrorsgargo00bent/page/82\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-0-7892-0182-9\n  }}</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\nIn early [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the fox is one of the sacred animals of the goddess [[Ninhursag]].

In contemporary Chinese, the word ''huli jing'' is often used to describe a mistress negatively in an extramarital affair. In [[Shinto]] of Japan, kitsune sometimes helps people as an errand of their deity, [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]].\n\n===Americas===\nThe [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] worshiped animals and often depicted the fox in their art.<ref>Katherine Berrin & Larco Museum (1997). ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Rafael Larco Herrera]]''.

The fox would not ever use physical attack, only mental.\n\nIn the [[Uncle Remus]] collection of 19th-century [[African-American]] folktales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], \"[[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Br'er Fox]]\" is a major character, often acting as the [[antagonist]] towards the stories' main character, \"[[Br'er Rabbit]]\".\n\n==In language==\n===As an epithet===\nThe Medieval [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer [[Robert Guiscard]] was nicknamed ''\"Robert the Fox\"'' as well as ''the Resourceful'', ''the Cunning'', ''the Wily'' - underlining the identification of such qualities with foxes.\n\nDuring the [[The American Revolution]] Continental Army Officer [[Francis Marion]] became so adept at attacking and Ambushing British forces in the swamps of [[South Carolina]] that he became known as the \u201cSwamp Fox\u201d\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the German commander in North Africa, [[Erwin Rommel]], was grudgingly nicknamed the \"Desert Fox\" by his British adversaries, as a tribute to his cunning and skill in operational art.\n\nThe [[Italy|Italian]] sociologist and economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848\u20131923) in his ''Trattato di Sociologia Generale'' (1916) developed the concept of an [[elite]] [[social class]], which he divided into cunning 'foxes' and violent 'lions'. In his view of society, the [[power (sociology)|power]] constantly passes from the 'foxes' to the 'lions' and vice versa.\n\n===Figures of speech===\nThe words ''fox'' and ''foxy'' have become slang in [[English language|English-speaking]] societies for an individual (most often female) with sex appeal. The word ''vixen'', which is normally the common name for a female fox, is also used to describe an attractive woman\u2014although, in the case of humans, \"vixen\" tends to imply that the woman in question has a few nasty qualities.\n\nThe word ''shenanigan'' (a deceitful [[confidence trick]], or [[mischief]]) is considered to be derived from the Irish expression ''sionnachuighim'', meaning \"''I play the fox''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourdictionary.com/shenanigan|title=Shenanigan dictionary definition &#124; shenanigan defined|website=Yourdictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n==Literature ==\n:''(in chronological order)''\n[[File:Obake Karuta 3-01.jpg|right|thumb|This Japanese ''[[karuta|obake karuta]]'' (monster card) from the early 19th century depicts a [[kitsune]] (fox spirit).

A tale with a fox as antagonist that bears striking similarities to [[Robert Southey]]'s \"The Story of the Three Bears\" was uncovered by the folklorist [[Joseph Jacobs]] and may predate Southey's version in the oral tradition.

This aims to reduce the turbulent air in the cars' wake to allow drivers to follow each other more closely whilst still maintaining a similar level of downforce compared to previous years. Further changes to the aerodynamics are aimed at limiting the teams' ability to control airflow around the front wheels and further reduce the cars' aerodynamic wake.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/07/19/f1-rubbishes-cookie-cutter-2021-design-concerns/|title=F1 rubbishes cookie cutter 2021 design concerns|first=Mat|last=Coch|work=[[Speedcafe|speedcafe.com]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111730/https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/07/19/f1-rubbishes-cookie-cutter-2021-design-concerns/|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This includes the elimination of bargeboards, the complex aerodynamic devices that manipulate airflow around the body of the car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tech-tuesday-whats-been-banned-under-the-2021-rules.50NPTzQjbIbIj5hXkhVVNw.html|title=Tech Tuesday: What's been banned under the 2021 rules|date=12 November 2019|website=formula1.com|publisher=[[Formula One Administration]]|url-status=live|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> The front wing and endplates will be simplified, reducing the number and complexity of aerodynamic elements. The front wing must also directly connect to the nosecone unlike pre-2021 designs where the wing could be connected to the nose via supports to create a space under the monocoque, thereby encouraging airflow under the car by way of the wing's larger surface area and the nose's increased height. The rear wings will be wider and mounted higher than in previous years, with additional restrictions in place to limit the teams' ability to use the car's exhaust gases to generate downforce and bodywork will be required to be coated in rubber to minimise the risk of components breaking off cars to minimise the risk of local yellow flags, safety cars and stoppages. Figures released by the Working Group revealed that where a {{F1|2019}}-specification car following another car had just 55% of its normal levels of downforce available, a 2021-specification car following another car would have up to 86% of its normal levels of downforce.<ref name=\"autosport youtube\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk-JKrs0rrc|title=F1's 2021 rule changes: 10 things you need to know|via=[[YouTube|youtube.com]]|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|access-date=24 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTeams will be further restricted in the number of aerodynamic upgrades they can introduce to the car, both over the course of a race weekend and over the  course of the championship.

This aims to reduce the turbulent air in the cars' wake to allow drivers to follow each other more closely whilst still maintaining a similar level of downforce compared to previous years. Further changes to the aerodynamics are aimed at limiting the teams' ability to control airflow around the front wheels and further reduce the cars' aerodynamic wake.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/07/19/f1-rubbishes-cookie-cutter-2021-design-concerns/|title=F1 rubbishes cookie cutter 2021 design concerns|first=Mat|last=Coch|work=[[Speedcafe|speedcafe.com]]|date=19 July 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111730/https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/07/19/f1-rubbishes-cookie-cutter-2021-design-concerns/|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This includes the elimination of bargeboards, the complex aerodynamic devices that manipulate airflow around the body of the car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tech-tuesday-whats-been-banned-under-the-2021-rules.50NPTzQjbIbIj5hXkhVVNw.html|title=Tech Tuesday: What's been banned under the 2021 rules|date=12 November 2019|website=formula1.com|publisher=[[Formula One Administration]]|url-status=live|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> The front wing and endplates will be simplified, reducing the number and complexity of aerodynamic elements. The front wing must also directly connect to the nosecone unlike pre-2021 designs where the wing could be connected to the nose via supports to create a space under the monocoque, thereby encouraging airflow under the car by way of the wing's larger surface area and the nose's increased height. The rear wings will be wider and mounted higher than in previous years, with additional restrictions in place to limit the teams' ability to use the car's exhaust gases to generate downforce and bodywork will be required to be coated in rubber to minimise the risk of components breaking off cars to minimise the risk of local yellow flags, safety cars and stoppages. Figures released by the Working Group revealed that where a {{F1|2019}}-specification car following another car had just 55% of its normal levels of downforce available, a 2021-specification car following another car would have up to 86% of its normal levels of downforce.<ref name=\"autosport youtube\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk-JKrs0rrc|title=F1's 2021 rule changes: 10 things you need to know|via=[[YouTube|youtube.com]]|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|access-date=24 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTeams will be further restricted in the number of aerodynamic upgrades they can introduce to the car, both over the course of a race weekend and over the  course of the championship.
