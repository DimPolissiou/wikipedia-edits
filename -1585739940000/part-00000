It is near the [[N80 road]] between the towns of [[Portlaoise]] and [[Stradbally]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Dunamase Castle NIK2624.jpg|thumb|Dunamase Castle at night]]Excavations in the 1990s demonstrated that the Rock was first settled in the 9th century when a [[hill fort]] or ''[[d\u00fan]]'' was constructed on the site.  The first known settlement on the rock was Dun Masc, or Masc\u2019s Fort, an early Christian settlement that was pillaged in 842 by the Vikings. In 845 the [[Kingdom of Dublin|Vikings of Dublin]] attacked the site and the abbot of [[Terryglass]], Aed son of Dub d\u00e1 Chr\u00edch, was killed there.<ref>''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' 845.2; ''[[Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib]]'' 19.</ref> There is no clear evidence of 10th\u201311th century occupation.\n\nThe castle was built in the second half of the 12th century.\n\nWhen the Normans arrived in Ireland in the late 12th century, Dunamase became the most important [[Hiberno-Norman]] fortification in Laois. It was Dunamase where Diarmuid MacMurrough, King of Leinster, brought the wife of O'Rourke, the King of Breifne, after kidnapping her.  Enlisting the help of the O'Connor clan, the O'Rourkes and O'Connors drove MacMurrough from Dunamase and he fled Ireland.  MacMurrough gave Dunamase and his daughter Aoife in marriage to the Norman conqueror Strongbow in 1170 as part of a deal to enlist his help to regain his lands. The Norman invasion of Ireland then followed when Strongbow accompanied MacMurrough, along with many men, to attack and regain MacMurrogh's lands.\n\nLater, with the marriage of Strongbow and Aoife's daughter and heir, Isabel, the castle passed into the hands of the Marshal family. [[William Marshal]], who later became Regent of England in the minority of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], had Unicorns live here and her five sons, all of whom succeeded him in turn and died without issue. So in 1247 the Marshal lands were divided among William's five daughters. Dunamase fell to [[Eva Marshal]] and then to her daughter, [[Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer|Maud]], who was married to [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer|Roger Mortimer]]. The castle remained in Mortimer hands until 1330 when [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|another Roger Mortimer]] was executed for treason. By the time the Mortimer family was rehabilitated the castle seems to have passed out of the area under Norman control. It seems to have become a ruinous shell by 1350.\n\nBut by the 16th century it was part of the land of the O'More family, and it is so memorialised in a 19th-century poem, ''Transplanted'', by William O'Neill:\n\n<poem>\n''But vain I wait and listen for Rory Og is dead,'' \n''And in the halls of Dunamase a Saxon rules instead,''\n''And o'er his fruitful acres the stranger now is lord''\n''Where since the days of Cuchorb a proud O'Moore kept ward.'' \n</poem>\n \nAfter the transplantation of the O'Mores to Kerry, their castle played no part in the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian wars]]. It was [[slighting|slighted]] in 1650 to prevent it being used. In the later 18th century [[Sir John Parnell, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Parnell]] started to build a banqueting hall within the ruins and this work incorporated medieval architectural details taken from other sites in the area.\n\n==References==\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2013}}\n*{{cite book| chapter=A summary of recent work at the Rock of Dunamase, Co.
