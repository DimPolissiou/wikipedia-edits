Warren]]. It stars [[Judy Geeson]], Robin Clarke and [[Stephanie Beacham]] with an early film appearance by [[Victoria Tennant]]. The plot concerns a group of archaeologists and scientists who are excavating the ruins of an ancient civilisation on a distant planet. After one of the women in the team, Sandy (Geeson), is raped and impregnated by a monstrous alien creature, she becomes psychotic and starts killing her colleagues one by one and [[Human cannibalism|eating their flesh]].\n\n''Inseminoid'' was written by [[Nick Maley|Nick]] and Gloria Maley, a married couple who had been members of the [[special effects]] team for Warren's earlier film ''[[Satan's Slave (1976 film)|Satan's Slave]]''. Filmed between May and June 1980 on a budget of \u00a31&nbsp;million, half of which was supplied by the [[Shaw Brothers]], it was shot largely on location at [[Chislehurst Caves]] in Kent and on the island of [[Gozo]] in [[Malta]], with a week's studio filming at Lee International Studios in London. Composer [[John Scott (composer)|John Scott]] completed the film's [[Electronic music|electronic]] musical score over hours-long recording sessions.\n\nDespite a positive box office response in the UK and overseas, ''Inseminoid'' failed to impress most critics, who reacted negatively to the film's production design and special effects. The acting in general was also poorly received, though Geeson's performance was praised. ''Inseminoid''{{'}}s reputation suffered from its premise of an extraterrestrial insemination, which led critics to regard the film as a weak copy of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979). However, both Warren and ''Alien'' distributors [[20th Century Fox]] rejected claims that the script for ''Inseminoid'' was influenced by the earlier film.\n\nAcademic criticism of ''Inseminoid'' has concentrated on the film's presentation of the female sex and [[Human female sexuality|female sexualities]] in the context of corruption by an alien source. Commentators have noted that as well as portraying Sandy as an [[abject]] [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], the film depicts a battle of the sexes as the character eliminates her former friends. The film was released on [[VHS]] to strong sales and novelised by Larry Miller.\n\n==Plot==\nOn a freezing planet, a team of 12 Xeno Project archaeologists and scientists are excavating the ruins of an ancient civilisation. They discover a cave system containing [[Rock art|wall markings]] and crystals of unknown origin. During a survey, a mysterious explosion cripples photographer Dean White and injures Ricky Williams. Deciphering the wall markings, [[Alien language|exolinguist]] Mitch theorises that the civilisation was based on a concept of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]: the planet orbits a [[binary star]] and seems to have been ruled by twins. Medical assistant Sharon discovers that the crystals are surrounded by an energy field and suggests that the civilisation was controlled by a form of [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|chemical intelligence]].\n\nA crystal sample begins to pulsate, causing the intelligence to take control of Ricky through a wound on his arm. In his delusional state, he is compelled to leave the team's base and re-enter the caves. He throws Gail into a pile of twisted metal, damaging her [[environmental suit]] and trapping her foot. Desperate to free herself, Gail removes her helmet and tries to amputate her foot with a chainsaw, but instead freezes to death in the planet's toxic atmosphere. Documentation officer Kate Carson shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he unseals the airlock and evacuates the base's breathable air.\n\nRicky and Gail are buried outside the base. Later, Mitch and Sandy return to the caves to collect more crystals. A monstrous alien creature appears and dismembers Mitch before raping Sandy. Sandy is taken back to base and treated by the team's doctor, Karl, who discovers that the rape has triggered an accelerated pregnancy. When further underground explosions block off the caves, the survivors are left with nothing to do but await pick-up by Xeno.\n\nThe intelligence takes over Sandy, giving her superhuman strength. She stabs Barbra to death with a pair of scissors and mutilates Dean and the remains of Mitch, [[Blood as food|drinking their blood]]. The rest of the team take refuge in the control room as Sandy uses explosives to blow up the base transmitter. When Sandy's psychosis appears to subside, Karl, Sharon and Commander Holly McKay attempt sedation. However, Sandy reverts to her former state, kills Karl and Holly and disembowels their corpses.\n\nMark radios Sandy from the control room to distract her while Kate and Gary arm themselves with chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she feeds on his flesh. She then re-enters the base and gives birth to hybrid twins. Mark stumbles across the newborns and leaves them with Sharon as Sandy blows up the door to the control room and proceeds to smash all the equipment inside. She then wounds Kate with another explosive charge and kills her. In a last fight to the death, Mark strangles Sandy with a length of cable. He returns to Sharon to find one of the twins drinking from her torn-out throat, then comes face to face with its equally bloodthirsty sibling.\n\nTwenty-eight days later, a Xeno shuttle lands on the planet to investigate the loss of contact with the team. With the base in ruins and its occupants either dead or missing, commandos Corin and Roy abandon the search for survivors and shuttle pilot Jeff radios Xeno control for clearance to return. The final shots reveal that the twins have stowed away inside a storage compartment on board the shuttle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Judy Geeson]] as Sandy\n* Robin Clarke as Mark\n* Jennifer Ashley as Holly McKay\n* [[Stephanie Beacham]] as Kate Carson\n* Steven Grives as Gary\n* Barrie Houghton as Karl\n* [[Rosalind Lloyd]] as Gail\n* [[Victoria Tennant]] as Barbra\n* [[Trevor Thomas (actor)|Trevor Thomas]] as Mitch\n* [[Heather Wright]] as Sharon\n* David Baxt as Ricky Williams\n* [[Dominic Jephcott]] as Dean White\n* John Segal as Jeff\n* Kevin O'Shea as Corin\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Roy\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter making ''[[Satan's Slave (1976 film)|Satan's Slave]]'' (1976), ''[[Prey (1977 film)|Prey]]'' (1977) and ''[[Terror (1978 film)|Terror]]'' (1978), [[Norman J.

The production filmed for three weeks [[Location shooting|on location]] at [[Chislehurst Caves]] in Kent and one week at Lee International Studios in [[Wembley Park]], London. A fifth week was devoted to effects and linking shots, completed by the [[second unit]] at Film House on London's [[Wardour Street]]. The crew then travelled to the island of [[Gozo]], [[Malta]] for a final, two-day location shoot to film the [[long shot]]s set on the planet's surface, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to ensure good lighting.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/>\n\nWarren says that shooting the base interior scenes at Chislehurst Caves produced more realistic results for the film's low budget than any possible studio alternative.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> However, the cold, damp and airless conditions inside the caves, compounded by the uneven terrain, caused frequent minor injuries among the cast and crew as well as damage to filming equipment. Shooting often ran for 12 hours at a time and some of those present developed intense feelings of [[claustrophobia]] in the confined space. Gordon believed that the uncomfortable working conditions made the actors' performances more credible, once stating: \"I think all this paid off in terms of what we got on the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult.\"<ref name=\"Interviews\"/> Due to the lack of space inside the caves, the crew were forced to set up their production office, as well as the dressing and make-up rooms, in a car park some distance from the location. When the filming started to fall behind schedule, Warren was forced to cut some of the scenes of Ricky's rampage inside the caves: \"Three pages of script, which I had to condense into one shot. Having to make such an enormous compromise was not a happy choice for me, but it was the only way of getting us back on schedule.\" The shoot ultimately overran by two days.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/>\n\nAs filming progressed, the working relationship between Warren and Clarke broke down. According to Warren, Clarke routinely refused to follow instructions and instead offered his own, unsolicited interpretation of the script, which made every scene featuring him \"an uphill struggle\". He remembers that during preparations for a fight scene, Clarke's behaviour caused him to lose his temper: \"Robin kept on ranting and raving about his ideas to the point where I couldn't take it any more. So I screamed at him to shut up and keep quiet. I told him I was the director and we would do the scene the way I said. He was shocked, he just stopped dead, and from that point on he hardly said a word.\"<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> Warren's rapports with the rest of the cast were positive. He has described Geeson as \"an absolute dream to work with\" and praised her acting, arguing that it avoids being unintentionally comic.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> Gordon was similarly impressed, stating that Geeson fully embraced her role and did not complain that it demeaned her as an actress.<ref name=\"Interviews\"/> Warren also has fond memories of Beacham's \"very professional\" performance, recalling that \"with tongue firmly in cheek, she would often wind me up by asking what her motivation was for a particular action, just as I about to call 'Action!', knowing full well that my answer would be, 'Because it's in the script'.\"<ref name=\"CinemaNocturna\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinema-nocturna.com/normanjwarren_interview.htm|title=Satan's Terror: An Exclusive Interview with Norman J.

Warren remembers that this format produced an \"incredibly sharp image and what I would term as the 'American' look.\" During [[post-production]], the picture was brightened as it was feared that if the film appeared too dimly lit it would be harder to sell to television broadcasters.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> In addition, some of the more graphic shots of Sandy's labour were removed to ensure that the film would not be rejected by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] (BBFC).<ref name=\"HollywoodInvestigator\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/2004/warren.htm|title=British Horror Director Norman J.

In the UK, the film premiered on 22 March in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], subsequently opening at 65 cinemas in the region. It reached London in October.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> The film was commercially successful, reaching fifth position at the UK box office and seventh in France.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/><ref name=\"HollywoodInvestigator\"/> ''Inseminoid'' was also one of the first films to receive a [[VHS]] release not long after cinema release, and in November 1981 reached seventh in the UK video charts.

''Inseminoid'' at a Cinema Near You Soon!\" Warren later regretted that the film had been announced in this fashion, commenting: \"The problem with mail drops is that you have no way of knowing who lives in the house, or who will see it first. It could be a pregnant woman, and old lady, or even worse, a young child.

Praising the film's cost-effective production values, he suggested that its violent on-screen killings carried Warren's \"particular trademark\". He added that ''Inseminoid'' \"is not faultless by any means,\" citing a predictable and often \"ridiculous\" plot as one of the film's downsides.

Peter Wright, a film historian and lecturer at the [[University of Liverpool]], believes that the \"atmospheric\" cave sequences and the mess hall scene preceding Ricky's madness may have been inspired by [[Ridley Scott]]'s film, comparing the former to the sequences set on the desolate planetoid and the latter to the violent reveal of the alien \"[[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|chestburster]]\".<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/> Wright considers the connection to ''Alien'' potentially \"[[Exploitation film|exploitative]]\";<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{Cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Peter|editor1-first=Mark|editor1-last=Bould|others=[[Andrew M.

He has also said that ''Alien'' distributors [[20th Century Fox]] were shown the final cut of ''Inseminoid'' and that even they discounted the possibility: \"... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare ''Alien'', which cost in the region of $30&nbsp;million, with ''Inseminoid'' which cost less than \u00a31&nbsp;million. We must have done something right.\"<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/>\n\nVarious commentators have discussed ''Inseminoid''{{'}}s depiction of sexual reproduction, [[female sexuality]], conflict between male and female [[gender role]]s, pregnancy, new motherhood and [[Other (philosophy)|Otherness]]. Wright interprets Sandy's transformation as a \"direct manifestation of masculine anxiety regarding female reproductive capacity\". He argues that the film's horror is internalised within the [[Sperm|seed]] of the alien being, which renders Sandy \"woman-as-other\" or \"[[abject]] \"Other\". This is in contrast with ''Alien'', which concerns transfer of \"fear of woman onto the alien other\". Wright suggests that ''Inseminoid'' contains echoes of the film ''[[Demon Seed]]'' (1977), in which a woman is raped and impregnated by an artificially-intelligent computer: \"in both films, women are framed as 'Other' by their sexual congress with more conventional iconic others: the machine and the alien.\" In all these films, pregnancy is depicted as a source of horror; in ''Inseminoid'', this is conveyed by the \"uterine and cervical\" [[title sequence]], suggestive of \"entering the realm of the monstrous womb ... the titling reveals a microscopic insect resident in the body of a larger organism.\"<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>\n\n[[File:InseminoidInsemination.jpg|thumb|left|alt=In the top half of the image, a woman lies naked on a table, visibly terried. A hypodermic needle is injecting fluid into her left arm. In the lower half, a giant, transparent phallus is shown between the woman's legs, pumping alien semen into her.|Sandy ([[Judy Geeson]]) is impregnated. Peter Wright believes that this scene displays conflicting attitudes to reproduction: while the alien [[phallus]] (bottom image) promotes fertilisation, Karl injecting Sandy's arm with a phallic hypodermic needle (top image, bottom-left corner) suppresses it.<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>]]\n\nWright argues that the distorted representation of the womb reveals similarities to the 1979 film ''[[The Brood]]'', in which a woman [[parthenogenetically]] gives birth to deformed offspring. Analysing the rape sequence itself, in which Karl injects Sandy with an unknown substance, Wright makes a connection to dialogue in other scenes implying that the women on the archaeological team are given regular contraceptive injections. Sandy's impregnation, conflicting with the suppression of fertilisation manifested in Karl's use of a hypodermic (and phallic) needle, reveals \"coherent sexism\": it \"attacks the very notion of female sexual freedom, while suggesting, paradoxically, that contraception is the responsibility of women.\" Sandy's accelerated pregnancy and regression to the level of a savage add to her depiction as an abject Other or object of \"male paranoia\".<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>\n\nDuring the struggle between Sandy and Gary, it is not until Gary has half-suffocated that Sandy kills him. Wright suggests that this sequence is reassuring from a male point of view as it implies that no woman \u2013 not even one with unnatural strength \u2013 is strong enough to kill a man in cold blood. That Sandy is ultimately killed by a man (Mark) makes her an aid in the re-empowerment of the male sex, although her offspring are quick to avenge their mother.<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/> Comparing the plot of ''Inseminoid'' to Christian scripture, [[Christopher Partridge]] of [[Lancaster University]] refers to the twins as \"essentially space [[Nephilim]], technological demons with appetites and habits reminiscent of the mythic forebears.\"<ref name=\"Religion\">{{Cite journal|last=Partridge |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Partridge |date=July 2004 |title=Alien Demonology: The Christian roots of the Malevolent Extraterrestrial in UFO Religions and Abduction Spiritualities |journal=Religion |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=163\u201389 |doi=10.1016/j.religion.2004.04.014 |url=http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/Demonology%20Alien,C.Partridge.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004734/http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/Demonology%20Alien,C.Partridge.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2010 |url-status=live  |citeseerx=10.1.1.523.5259 }}</ref>\n\nThe film's sexual references continue into the epilogue, which shows the arrival of rescuers Jeff, Corin and Roy. In an allusion to the [[menstrual cycle]], it is stated in dialogue that 28 days have passed since Xeno lost contact with the team. The deaths of the archaeologists are attributed to an \"internal disturbance of some kind\"; Wright calls this \"an ironic phrase which encapsulates the film's vision of pregnancy as an irruption of Otherness from within.\"<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>\n\nDiscussing Larry Miller's novelisation, which he describes as \"imaginative and misogynistic\", Wright notes a number of scenes that are absent from the film and portray a distorted image of the female form, causing revulsion in the reader. Miller has Sandy grow sores and her nipples ooze pus, which Wright likens to [[colostrum]].

Warren]]. It stars [[Judy Geeson]], Robin Clarke and [[Stephanie Beacham]] with an early film appearance by [[Victoria Tennant]]. The plot concerns a group of archaeologists and scientists who are excavating the ruins of an ancient civilisation on a distant planet. After one of the women in the team, Sandy (Geeson), is raped and impregnated by a monstrous alien creature, she becomes psychotic and starts killing her colleagues one by one and [[Human cannibalism|eating their flesh]].\n\n''Inseminoid'' was written by [[Nick Maley|Nick]] and Gloria Maley, a married couple who had been members of the [[special effects]] team for Warren's earlier film ''[[Satan's Slave (1976 film)|Satan's Slave]]''. Filmed between May and June 1980 on a budget of \u00a31&nbsp;million, half of which was supplied by the [[Shaw Brothers]], it was shot largely on location at [[Chislehurst Caves]] in Kent and on the island of [[Gozo]] in [[Malta]], with a week's studio filming at Lee International Studios in London. Composer [[John Scott (composer)|John Scott]] completed the film's [[Electronic music|electronic]] musical score over hours-long recording sessions.\n\nDespite a positive box office response in the UK and overseas, ''Inseminoid'' failed to impress most critics, who reacted negatively to the film's production design and special effects. The acting in general was also poorly received, though Geeson's performance was praised. ''Inseminoid''{{'}}s reputation suffered from its premise of an extraterrestrial insemination, which led critics to regard the film as a weak copy of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979). However, both Warren and ''Alien'' distributors [[20th Century Fox]] rejected claims that the script for ''Inseminoid'' was influenced by the earlier film.\n\nAcademic criticism of ''Inseminoid'' has concentrated on the film's presentation of the female sex and [[Human female sexuality|female sexualities]] in the context of corruption by an alien source. Commentators have noted that as well as portraying Sandy as an [[abject]] [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], the film depicts a battle of the sexes as the character eliminates her former friends. The film was released on [[VHS]] to strong sales and novelised by Larry Miller.\n\n==Plot==\nOn a freezing planet, a team of 12 Xeno Project archaeologists and scientists are excavating the ruins of an ancient civilisation. They discover a cave system containing [[Rock art|wall markings]] and crystals of unknown origin. During a survey, a mysterious explosion cripples photographer Dean White and injures Ricky Williams. Deciphering the wall markings, [[Alien language|exolinguist]] Mitch theorises that the civilisation was based on a concept of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]: the planet orbits a [[binary star]] and seems to have been ruled by twins. Medical assistant Sharon discovers that the crystals are surrounded by an energy field and suggests that the civilisation was controlled by a form of [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|chemical intelligence]].\n\nA crystal sample begins to pulsate, causing the intelligence to take control of Ricky through a wound on his arm. In his delusional state, he is compelled to leave the team's base and re-enter the caves. He throws Gail into a pile of twisted metal, damaging her [[environmental suit]] and trapping her foot. Desperate to free herself, Gail removes her helmet and tries to amputate her foot with a chainsaw, but instead freezes to death in the planet's toxic atmosphere. Documentation officer Kate Carson shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he unseals the airlock and evacuates the base's breathable air.\n\nRicky and Gail are buried outside the base. Later, Mitch and Sandy return to the caves to collect more crystals. A monstrous alien creature appears and dismembers Mitch before raping Sandy. Sandy is taken back to base and treated by the team's doctor, Karl, who discovers that the rape has triggered an accelerated pregnancy. When further underground explosions block off the caves, the survivors are left with nothing to do but await pick-up by Xeno.\n\nThe intelligence takes over Sandy, giving her superhuman strength. She stabs Barbra to death with a pair of scissors and mutilates Dean and the remains of Mitch, [[Blood as food|drinking their blood]]. The rest of the team take refuge in the control room as Sandy uses explosives to blow up the base transmitter. When Sandy's psychosis appears to subside, Karl, Sharon and Commander Holly McKay attempt sedation. However, Sandy reverts to her former state, kills Karl and Holly and disembowels their corpses.\n\nMark radios Sandy from the control room to distract her while Kate and Gary arm themselves with chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she feeds on his flesh. She then re-enters the base and gives birth to hybrid twins. Mark stumbles across the newborns and leaves them with Sharon as Sandy blows up the door to the control room and proceeds to smash all the equipment inside. She then wounds Kate with another explosive charge and kills her. In a last fight to the death, Mark strangles Sandy with a length of cable. He returns to Sharon to find one of the twins drinking from her torn-out throat, then comes face to face with its equally bloodthirsty sibling.\n\nTwenty-eight days later, a Xeno shuttle lands on the planet to investigate the loss of contact with the team. With the base in ruins and its occupants either dead or missing, commandos Corin and Roy abandon the search for survivors and shuttle pilot Jeff radios Xeno control for clearance to return. The final shots reveal that the twins have stowed away inside a storage compartment on board the shuttle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Judy Geeson]] as Sandy\n* Robin Clarke as Mark\n* Jennifer Ashley as Holly McKay\n* [[Stephanie Beacham]] as Kate Carson\n* Steven Grives as Gary\n* Barrie Houghton as Karl\n* [[Rosalind Lloyd]] as Gail\n* [[Victoria Tennant]] as Barbra\n* [[Trevor Thomas (actor)|Trevor Thomas]] as Mitch\n* [[Heather Wright]] as Sharon\n* David Baxt as Ricky Williams\n* [[Dominic Jephcott]] as Dean White\n* John Segal as Jeff\n* Kevin O'Shea as Corin\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Roy\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter making ''[[Satan's Slave (1976 film)|Satan's Slave]]'' (1976), ''[[Prey (1977 film)|Prey]]'' (1977) and ''[[Terror (1978 film)|Terror]]'' (1978), [[Norman J.

The production filmed for three weeks [[Location shooting|on location]] at [[Chislehurst Caves]] in Kent and one week at Lee International Studios in [[Wembley Park]], London. A fifth week was devoted to effects and linking shots, completed by the [[second unit]] at Film House on London's [[Wardour Street]]. The crew then travelled to the island of [[Gozo]], [[Malta]] for a final, two-day location shoot to film the [[long shot]]s set on the planet's surface, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to ensure good lighting.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/>\n\nWarren says that shooting the base interior scenes at Chislehurst Caves produced more realistic results for the film's low budget than any possible studio alternative.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> However, the cold, damp and airless conditions inside the caves, compounded by the uneven terrain, caused frequent minor injuries among the cast and crew as well as damage to filming equipment. Shooting often ran for 12 hours at a time and some of those present developed intense feelings of [[claustrophobia]] in the confined space. Gordon believed that the uncomfortable working conditions made the actors' performances more credible, once stating: \"I think all this paid off in terms of what we got on the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult.\"<ref name=\"Interviews\"/> Due to the lack of space inside the caves, the crew were forced to set up their production office, as well as the dressing and make-up rooms, in a car park some distance from the location. When the filming started to fall behind schedule, Warren was forced to cut some of the scenes of Ricky's rampage inside the caves: \"Three pages of script, which I had to condense into one shot. Having to make such an enormous compromise was not a happy choice for me, but it was the only way of getting us back on schedule.\" The shoot ultimately overran by two days.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/>\n\nAs filming progressed, the working relationship between Warren and Clarke broke down. According to Warren, Clarke routinely refused to follow instructions and instead offered his own, unsolicited interpretation of the script, which made every scene featuring him \"an uphill struggle\". He remembers that during preparations for a fight scene, Clarke's behaviour caused him to lose his temper: \"Robin kept on ranting and raving about his ideas to the point where I couldn't take it any more. So I screamed at him to shut up and keep quiet. I told him I was the director and we would do the scene the way I said. He was shocked, he just stopped dead, and from that point on he hardly said a word.\"<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> Warren's rapports with the rest of the cast were positive. He has described Geeson as \"an absolute dream to work with\" and praised her acting, arguing that it avoids being unintentionally comic.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> Gordon was similarly impressed, stating that Geeson fully embraced her role and did not complain that it demeaned her as an actress.<ref name=\"Interviews\"/> Warren also has fond memories of Beacham's \"very professional\" performance, recalling that \"with tongue firmly in cheek, she would often wind me up by asking what her motivation was for a particular action, just as I about to call 'Action!', knowing full well that my answer would be, 'Because it's in the script'.\"<ref name=\"CinemaNocturna\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinema-nocturna.com/normanjwarren_interview.htm|title=Satan's Terror: An Exclusive Interview with Norman J.

In the UK, the film premiered on 22 March in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], subsequently opening at 65 cinemas in the region. It reached London in October.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> The film was commercially successful, reaching fifth position at the UK box office and seventh in France.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/><ref name=\"HollywoodInvestigator\"/> ''Inseminoid'' was also one of the first films to receive a [[VHS]] release not long after cinema release, and in November 1981 reached seventh in the UK video charts.

''Inseminoid'' at a Cinema Near You Soon!\" Warren later regretted that the film had been announced in this fashion, commenting: \"The problem with mail drops is that you have no way of knowing who lives in the house, or who will see it first.

Praising the film's cost-effective production values, he suggested that its violent on-screen killings carried Warren's \"particular trademark\". He added that ''Inseminoid'' \"is not faultless by any means,\" citing a predictable and often \"ridiculous\" plot as one of the film's downsides. However, he concluded that it met audience expectations for a sci-fi [[B movie]], declaring it \"far less routine and far more enjoyable than I had expected.\"<ref name=\"Jones\"/>\n\nIn the US, ''Inseminoid'' made the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' top ten list.<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/> Critical response from other commentators was less favourable.

Peter Wright, a film historian and lecturer at the [[University of Liverpool]], believes that the \"atmospheric\" cave sequences and the mess hall scene preceding Ricky's madness may have been inspired by [[Ridley Scott]]'s film, comparing the former to the sequences set on the desolate planetoid and the latter to the violent reveal of the alien \"[[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|chestburster]]\".<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/> Wright considers the connection to ''Alien'' potentially \"[[Exploitation film|exploitative]]\";<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{Cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Peter|editor1-first=Mark|editor1-last=Bould|others=[[Andrew M.

Except here is the basic idea contained in ''Alien'' taken to its sleaziest extreme.\" He finds one such parallel in the character of Kate (Stephanie Beacham), whom he likens to [[Ellen Ripley]] ([[Sigourney Weaver]]). However, he also regards ''[[Contamination (film)|Contamination]]'' (1980) and ''[[Scared to Death (1981 film)|Scared to Death]]'' (1981) as less effective imitations of Scott.<ref name=\"Jones\">{{Cite magazine|magazine=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|title=''Inseminoid''|first1=Alan|last1=Jones|author1-link=Alan Jones (film critic)|issue=34|year=1981|page=10|editor1-first=Alan|editor1-last=McKenzie|editor1-link=Alan McKenzie|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|location=London, UK}}</ref> Edward Jones suggests that the plot of ''Inseminoid'' also borrows from the novel ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897), the TV series ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' (1976\u201378) and the films ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951) and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"FreeLanceStar\"/>\n\nThough he acknowledges similarities to ''Alien'', Warren has denied claims that ''Inseminoid'' was made as an imitation, pointing out that the script for his film was completed months before ''Alien'' was released in the UK. He has also said that ''Alien'' distributors [[20th Century Fox]] were shown the final cut of ''Inseminoid'' and that even they discounted the possibility: \"... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare ''Alien'', which cost in the region of $30&nbsp;million, with ''Inseminoid'' which cost less than \u00a31&nbsp;million. We must have done something right.\"<ref name=\"WideScreenMovies\"/>\n\nVarious commentators have discussed ''Inseminoid''{{'}}s depiction of sexual reproduction, [[female sexuality]], conflict between male and female [[gender role]]s, pregnancy, new motherhood and [[Other (philosophy)|Otherness]]. Wright interprets Sandy's transformation as a \"direct manifestation of masculine anxiety regarding female reproductive capacity\". He argues that the film's horror is internalised within the [[Sperm|seed]] of the alien being, which renders Sandy \"woman-as-other\" or \"[[abject]] \"Other\". This is in contrast with ''Alien'', which concerns transfer of \"fear of woman onto the alien other\". Wright suggests that ''Inseminoid'' contains echoes of the film ''[[Demon Seed]]'' (1977), in which a woman is raped and impregnated by an artificially-intelligent computer: \"in both films, women are framed as 'Other' by their sexual congress with more conventional iconic others: the machine and the alien.\" In all these films, pregnancy is depicted as a source of horror; in ''Inseminoid'', this is conveyed by the \"uterine and cervical\" [[title sequence]], suggestive of \"entering the realm of the monstrous womb ... the titling reveals a microscopic insect resident in the body of a larger organism.\"<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>\n\n[[File:InseminoidInsemination.jpg|thumb|left|alt=In the top half of the image, a woman lies naked on a table, visibly terried. A hypodermic needle is injecting fluid into her left arm. In the lower half, a giant, transparent phallus is shown between the woman's legs, pumping alien semen into her.|Sandy ([[Judy Geeson]]) is impregnated. Peter Wright believes that this scene displays conflicting attitudes to reproduction: while the alien [[phallus]] (bottom image) promotes fertilisation, Karl injecting Sandy's arm with a phallic hypodermic needle (top image, bottom-left corner) suppresses it.<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>]]\n\nWright argues that the distorted representation of the womb reveals similarities to the 1979 film ''[[The Brood]]'', in which a woman [[parthenogenetically]] gives birth to deformed offspring. Analysing the rape sequence itself, in which Karl injects Sandy with an unknown substance, Wright makes a connection to dialogue in other scenes implying that the women on the archaeological team are given regular contraceptive injections. Sandy's impregnation, conflicting with the suppression of fertilisation manifested in Karl's use of a hypodermic (and phallic) needle, reveals \"coherent sexism\": it \"attacks the very notion of female sexual freedom, while suggesting, paradoxically, that contraception is the responsibility of women.\" Sandy's accelerated pregnancy and regression to the level of a savage add to her depiction as an abject Other or object of \"male paranoia\".<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>\n\nDuring the struggle between Sandy and Gary, it is not until Gary has half-suffocated that Sandy kills him. Wright suggests that this sequence is reassuring from a male point of view as it implies that no woman \u2013 not even one with unnatural strength \u2013 is strong enough to kill a man in cold blood. That Sandy is ultimately killed by a man (Mark) makes her an aid in the re-empowerment of the male sex, although her offspring are quick to avenge their mother.<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/> Comparing the plot of ''Inseminoid'' to Christian scripture, [[Christopher Partridge]] of [[Lancaster University]] refers to the twins as \"essentially space [[Nephilim]], technological demons with appetites and habits reminiscent of the mythic forebears.\"<ref name=\"Religion\">{{Cite journal|last=Partridge |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Partridge |date=July 2004 |title=Alien Demonology: The Christian roots of the Malevolent Extraterrestrial in UFO Religions and Abduction Spiritualities |journal=Religion |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=163\u201389 |doi=10.1016/j.religion.2004.04.014 |url=http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/Demonology%20Alien,C.Partridge.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004734/http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/Demonology%20Alien,C.Partridge.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2010 |url-status=live  |citeseerx=10.1.1.523.5259 }}</ref>\n\nThe film's sexual references continue into the epilogue, which shows the arrival of rescuers Jeff, Corin and Roy. In an allusion to the [[menstrual cycle]], it is stated in dialogue that 28 days have passed since Xeno lost contact with the team. The deaths of the archaeologists are attributed to an \"internal disturbance of some kind\"; Wright calls this \"an ironic phrase which encapsulates the film's vision of pregnancy as an irruption of Otherness from within.\"<ref name=\"BritishScienceFictionCinema\"/>\n\nDiscussing Larry Miller's novelisation, which he describes as \"imaginative and misogynistic\", Wright notes a number of scenes that are absent from the film and portray a distorted image of the female form, causing revulsion in the reader. Miller has Sandy grow sores and her nipples ooze pus, which Wright likens to [[colostrum]].

Harris passed for 386 yards, including three touchdown passes, and rushed for Bowling Green's fourth touchdown. Harris' completion record of 38/50 and total offense of 454 yards set Motor City Bowl records. Wright had 21 carries for 237 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown run which was the second-longest in Motor City Bowl history.<ref name=\"recap\">{{cite news|title=Harris throws 3 second-half TDs|website=[[ESPN.com]]|date=December 26, 2003|accessdate=January 10, 2010|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=233600189}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bowling Green defeats Northwestern 28\u201324 in Motor City|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 26, 2003|accessdate=January 10, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/bowls/2003-12-27-motor_x.htm|first=Ron|last=Vample}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\u00b0==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031225172413/http://motorcitybowl.com/ Official site]\n\n{{2003 bowl game navbox}}\n{{Little Caesars Pizza Bowl navbox}}\n{{Bowling Green Falcons bowl game navbox}}\n{{Northwestern Wildcats bowl game navbox}}\n\n[[Category:2003\u201304 NCAA football bowl games|Motor City]]\n[[Category:Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]]\n[[Category:Bowling Green Falcons football bowl games]]\n[[Category:Northwestern Wildcats football bowl games]]\n[[Category:December 2003 sports events in the United States]]\n[[Category:2003 in sports in Michigan]]\n[[Category:2003 in Detroit]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Motor_City_Bowl"}

He was one of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s closest friends in politics. After Reagan was elected [[President of the United States|President]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], many in the national press referred to Laxalt as \"The First Friend.\" He was the older brother of [[Robert Laxalt]], who was a noted and prolific writer. He was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Early life, education, and early career==\nLaxalt was born on August 2, 1922 in [[Reno, Nevada]]. He was the son of [[Basque people|Basque]] parents, Therese (Alpetche)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5MUAQAAIAAJ&q=Therese+Alpetche+Laxalt&dq=Therese+Alpetche+Laxalt&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K9Y6VfgzydawBe_jgbAJ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg|title=Mothers of achievement in American history, 1776-1976: Bi-centennial project, 1974-1976|first=|last=American Mothers Committee|date=August 1, 1976|publisher=C.

A shepherd, Dominique became wealthy in the sheep industry. After losing everything in the early 1920s, he returned to shepherding for the rest of his career. Therese, who had been trained at Paris's [[Le Cordon Bleu|Cordon Bleu]] cooking school, eventually opened a restaurant called The French Hotel in [[Carson City, Nevada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nevadawomen.org/research-center/biographies-alphabetical/therese-alpetche-laxalt/|title=THER\u00c9SE ALPETCHE LAXALT - Nevada Women's History Project|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nTherese and Dominique had six children: Paul, [[Robert Laxalt|Robert]] (born in 1923), Suzanne (1925), John (1926), Marie (1928) and Peter (1931). Robert became an author; Suzanne, a Roman Catholic nun; John, a lawyer and political consultant; Marie, a school teacher; and Peter (Mick), an attorney.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The Laxalt children were raised largely by their mother, as Dominique spent long periods of time away from the household tending his sheep in the deserts and mountains of Nevada. The children all helped Therese at The French Hotel. It was there that Paul first acquired an interest in politics as he listened in on the conversations of the politicians who patronized the restaurant (including the legendary [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Pat McCarran]]).\n\nPaul played on the 1938 state basketball champion team at [[Carson High School (Carson City, Nevada)|Carson High School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/paul-laxalt-former-nevada-governor-senator-dies-at-96/|title=Paul Laxalt, former Nevada governor, senator, dies at 96|date=August 7, 2018|publisher=}}</ref> before graduating and attending Santa Clara University. When World War II broke out, Paul joined the U.S. Army and served as a medic, seeing action in the [[Battle of Leyte]] in the Philippines. After the war, he graduated from the [[University of Denver]] (1949) law school.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.denverpost.com/2006/03/01/du-honors-its-alumni-of-distinction/ |title= DU honors its alumni of distinction |work= [[The Denver Post]] | last= Davidson |first= Joanne |date= March 1, 2006 |access-date= May 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from law school and after serving as a district attorney, Laxalt enjoyed a successful career as a lawyer. His clients included George Whittell, who owned a large portion of the Lake Tahoe frontage on the Nevada side of the lake, Harvey and Llewellyn Gross, who built and ran Harvey's Wagon Wheel on Lake Tahoe's south shore, and Dick Graves, founder of the Sparks Nugget. While representing Graves, Laxalt helped win the famous \"Golden Rooster case\" in which the federal government tried to confiscate a 15-pound solid gold rooster that Graves displayed near the entrance of his Golden Rooster restaurant.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://author.doresabanning.com/2016/07/20/golden-rooster-advertising-or-art/ |title= Golden Rooster: Advertising or Art? |last= Banning |first= Doresa |date= July 20, 2016 |access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nPaul Laxalt's first attempt for public office was in 1950 when he ran for [[District Attorney]] of [[Ormsby County, Nevada]], turning out the incumbent D.A. He served from 1950 to 1954. Laxalt's first run for statewide office came in 1962 when he ran for [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nevada|Lieutenant Governor]] against former [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Berkeley L. Bunker]]. Using innovative television ads and personal television appearances, Laxalt was able to introduce himself to the electorate, particularly in Southern Nevada where he was virtually unknown. In the middle of the campaign, at a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] rally in Las Vegas, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial candidate and then-[[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nevada|Lt. Gov.]] [[Rex Bell]], a former Hollywood actor who had persuaded Laxalt to run with him on the GOP \"ticket\", died of a heart attack. A great amount of pressure was applied to Laxalt to run in Bell's place, but the young attorney demurred, and he remained in the lieutenant governor's race. He ended up defeating Bunker by a comfortable margin. Laxalt served one term as lieutenant governor from 1963 to 1967.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===1964 U.S. Senate run===\nIn [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1964|1964]], while serving as lieutenant governor, Laxalt ran for the [[United States Senate]] against freshman [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Howard Cannon]]. Laxalt had wanted to remain lieutenant governor. However, he declared his candidacy in mid-1964 after no other serious Republican contenders expressed interest. He did not have to give up his lieutenant governor's post for this race, since he was not up for reelection until 1966.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nRepublican candidates, running concurrently with the 1964 federal election, were undermined by the unpopularity of [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Barry Goldwater]] [[List of United States Senators from Arizona|from]] [[Arizona]], the [[List of United States Republican Party presidential tickets|Republican nominee]] for [[President of the United States|President]] against incumbent [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and the leader of their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt's advisors told him he should \"duck\" Goldwater, as they feared any association with Goldwater would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his \"political Godfather\", reportedly told his aides, \"Listen, Barry Goldwater is my friend. If I snubbed him now, I could never look him in the face again. I would rather lose.\" The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner. The next morning he flew to Las Vegas where he was told that certain precincts reported late and that Cannon had won by 48 votes, among the [[List of close election results|narrowest margins]] in a popular election for the U.S. Senate. The race was the subject of intense controversy for years.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Governor===\n[[File:Governor Laxalt.jpg|thumb|Governor Laxalt]]\nLaxalt then decided to challenge two-term [[List of Governors of Nevada|Gov.]] [[Grant Sawyer]]. Although the election would not take place until November of [[Nevada gubernatorial election, 1966|1966]], Laxalt launched his campaign in the middle of 1965. One of the most hotly debated issues during the campaign was the federal government's involvement in Nevada gaming operations. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and Justice Department had deep suspicions about organized crime's involvement in the gambling industry. Sawyer took the position that the federal government should stay out of Nevada's affairs. Laxalt took the position that Nevada had to cooperate with \"the Feds\" in order to be in a position to regulate gambling credibly. (In fact, one of Laxalt's first moves after his election was to meet with [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to express Nevada's desire to establish a cooperative relationship.) During the gubernatorial campaign, Laxalt also led a movement to purge members of the [[John Birch Society]] from the [[Nevada Republican Party|state Republican Party]]. Sawyer was defeated by an unexpectedly wide margin (nearly 6,000 votes). Laxalt served one term as governor, from January 1967 to January 1971.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nLaxalt's tenure as governor was noteworthy for coinciding with the purchase of several hotel-[[casino]]s by reclusive billionaire [[Howard Hughes]]. Laxalt allowed Hughes to secure his gaming license without appearing before the state's gaming regulatory authorities because he thought having an internationally acclaimed businessman involved in Nevada gaming would send a positive signal about the legitimacy of the industry. Laxalt also supported corporate ownership of gaming operations in Nevada, which helped pave the way for modern-day gambling. With the financial support of Hughes, Laxalt helped establish the state's first [[community college]]s and Nevada's first medical school.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAlong with [[Governor of California|Gov.]] [[Ronald Reagan]] of neighboring [[California]], Laxalt helped create the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, to protect scenic [[Lake Tahoe]]. He also expanded the park system and promoted prison reform in Nevada. On one occasion, Laxalt, against the advice of his staff, went to the [[Nevada State Prison|Nevada State Penitentiary]] during a prisoner uprising. He met personally with several prisoners who described to the governor the deplorable conditions under which they were living. Laxalt sympathized with their concerns and ordered the prison staff to address the problems. When he was later asked by the media if he had qualms about entering the prison yard, Laxalt, a former trial lawyer, said, \"No, not really.

In [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1974|1974]], when twenty-year [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Alan Bible]] announced his retirement, Republican political insiders pressed Laxalt to re-enter politics and seek the open U.S. Senate seat. He eventually agreed and wound up running against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, then-[[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nevada|Lt. Gov.]] [[Harry Reid]]. At that time the [[Watergate scandal]] was a burden for all Republicans running for national office in [[United States elections, 1974|1974]]. Nonetheless, early in the campaign, Laxalt enjoyed a consistent but tight lead over Reid in most polls. However, after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] pardoned former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], Laxalt's prospects, like Republican prospects everywhere, suddenly took a dramatic turn for the worse. Laxalt compared it to having \"a hundred pound weight around my neck.\" Still, he managed a victory by fewer than one thousand votes. To give Laxalt a leg-up in seniority, Sen. Bible resigned three weeks early on December 18, 1974. [[List of Governors of Nevada|Gov.]] [[Mike O'Callaghan]] (Laxalt's successor as governor) appointed Laxalt to finish out Bible's term.\n\nIn [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1980|1980]], Laxalt won re-election over former [[Nevada Senate|state Sen.]] [[Mary Gojack]] with 59% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-15/local/me-2270_1_nevada-senate |title=Ex-Nevada Lawmaker Mary Gojack Dies : Former Blackjack Dealer Fought on Behalf of Women, Minorities |date=November 15, 1985 |access-date=August 7, 2018 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n====Senate tenure====\n[[File:PaulLaxalt.JPG|thumb|Senate picture]]\nIn his first term in the [[United States Senate]], Laxalt was active in many legislative battles. In 1977, he led the fight against [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]'s proposal to transfer the [[Panama Canal]] to the [[Panama]]nian government. Despite being in the minority in the Senate, Laxalt helped build a coalition opposed to the [[Panama Canal Treaties]]. Opponents successfully built a grassroots campaign designed to put pressure on the Senate. On the day of the vote, Laxalt was confident that he would be able to secure the 34 votes needed to defeat the treaties. However, his colleague, [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Howard Cannon]] (also from Nevada), decided to support the treaties. Even in defeat, Laxalt had won plaudits from both sides of the aisle for the manner in which he led the opposition. Indeed, throughout his Senate tenure, Laxalt remained popular among his colleagues, principally because he was viewed as a \"straight shooter\" and someone who never allowed political differences to turn personal. He was good friends with conservative [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Jesse Helms]] [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|from]] [[North Carolina]] and liberal [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Ted Kennedy]] [[List of United States Senators from Massachusetts|from]] [[Massachusetts]]. (At the request of Sen. Kennedy, Laxalt arranged to have [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] present [[Ethel Kennedy]] with the original copy of the medal honoring her late husband [[Robert F. Kennedy]].){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nDuring Laxalt's two terms in the U.S. Senate, he served on several influential committees, including the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Labor and Public Welfare Committee]], the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], and the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]]. When [[United States Senate elections, 1980|Republicans took control of the Senate in 1981]], Laxalt became chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Regulatory Reform Subcommittee, and the Appropriations Committee's State, Justice and Commerce Subcommittee. In 1986, while serving on the Judiciary Committee, Laxalt played a key behind-the-scenes role in securing the committee's approval of President Reagan's nomination of then-[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] for [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Negotiating principally with Sen. Ted Kennedy and [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Joe Biden]] [[List of United States Senators from Delaware|from]] [[Delaware]], Laxalt was able to strike a deal that allowed the committee to vote on the nomination.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Rehnquist was subsequently approved by the full Senate by a margin of 65&ndash;33.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Relationship with Ronald Reagan===\n[[File:Paul Laxalt and Ronald Reagan 1980.jpg|thumb|right|Senator Laxalt and then-candidate Reagan during the 1980 campaign]]\n[[File:C17592-20a.jpg|thumb|right|Laxalt, his wife, Carol, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]], [[Bob Michel]] and his wife, Corrine, watch the Oak Ridge Boys performance during the Barbecue for Members of Congress on the South Lawn in 1983]] \nLaxalt had become close friends with [[Ronald Reagan]] during his time as governor, when Reagan was also in his first term as governor of neighboring [[California]]. They worked on many issues of mutual interest to both states, particularly those dealing with the preservation of [[Lake Tahoe]]. During Reagan's presidency, Laxalt was sometimes referred to as \"The First Friend\".<ref name=\"FirstFriend\">{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Roberts |title=Reagan's First Friend |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/magazine/reagan-s-first-friend.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=A.26 |date=March 21, 1982 }}</ref> Laxalt was national chairman of three Reagan presidential campaigns and placed Reagan's name in nomination at the [[Republican National Convention]]s of [[1976 Republican National Convention|1976]], [[1980 Republican National Convention|1980]], and [[1984 Republican National Convention|1984]]. During the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], Laxalt's name was floated as a potential [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] nominee for the Reagan ticket, but [[George H. W. Bush]] was chosen instead.<ref>[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3492521.html \"How the Bush Dynasty Almost Wasn't\"], ''Hoover Digest''</ref> At the behest of President Reagan, Laxalt served in the then-unprecedented role of General Chairman of the Republican Party from 1983 to 1987.\n \nIn fact, during Laxalt's second Senate term, due in large measure to his relationship with Reagan, several Nevadans came to Washington, D.C. to serve in prominent governmental and campaign positions. His long-time aide, [[Barbara Vucanovich]], had been elected to serve in the House in 1982, becoming the first female elected to a federal position from Nevada. A long-time friend and prominent Nevada trial attorney, [[Frank Fahrenkopf]], was elected to serve as Chairman of the Republican National Committee where he helped oversee [[1984 United States presidential election|Reagan's re-election]] and the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. Bob Broadbent of [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]] became Assistant Secretary for Water and Science in the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]; Bob Horton of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] became Director of the Bureau of Mines; Cameron Batjer of Reno, a former [[Supreme Court of Nevada|Nevada Supreme Court]] [[List of justices of the Supreme Court of Nevada|Justice]], served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission; Reese Taylor of [[Las Vegas]] served as Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission; and Ed Allison of Reno, [[Sig Rogich]] of Las Vegas, and [[Ralph V. Whitworth]] of [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]] all served in key roles in Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign. Laxalt's former Press Secretary and Chief of Staff, Tom Loranger, joined Laxalt in his post-Senate government consulting practice and now runs the D.C. office of the Ferraro Group, a Nevada government-relations firm founded by former Laxalt aide Greg Ferraro. In early 1987, Laxalt was at the top of the short list to replace [[Donald Regan]] as [[White House Chief of Staff]], but he declined because he intended to run for President in 1988. Instead, he recommended former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Majority [[Howard Baker]], who took the job.<ref>Lamar, Jacob V. Jr. (March 9, 1987), [http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,963713,00.html \"Cover Stories\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\nIt was the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Republican presidential race]] that may have cemented the tight political friendship between Laxalt and former-[[Governor of California|Gov.]] Reagan. In 1976, Reagan had decided to [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1976|run for president]], challenging [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] for the Republican nomination. Ford enjoyed widespread support among the Republican establishment, particularly in Washington, D.C. Reagan decided that having Laxalt serve as his national chairman would give his campaign credibility it was otherwise lacking. Although Laxalt was not well-known on a national level, he was well liked and respected in the U.S. Congress, and he was similarly respected by many prominent members of the national media. Laxalt eventually acceded to Reagan's request, even though doing so severely jeopardized his relationship with the Ford White House. Laxalt campaigned all over the United States on behalf of Reagan, often campaigning by his side.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nWith his back to the wall, Reagan won shocking victories in North Carolina and Texas, which propelled the race all the way to the national convention in Kansas City. Laxalt nominated Reagan at the convention. Eventually, the Reagan campaign lost a key procedural vote to Ford and the sitting President eked out a victory. Although he was on the losing side, Laxalt's national profile increased dramatically as a result of his efforts on behalf of Reagan. When Reagan defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], with Laxalt again serving as national chairman of [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|Reagan's campaign]], Laxalt's profile rose even higher.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Sacramento ''Bee'' libel suit====\nAs a long-time public official in Nevada, where individuals with alleged ties to organized crime were prominent in the early Las Vegas gaming industry, Laxalt came under scrutiny for his relationships with certain individuals. In 1983, during Laxalt's second Senate term and on the eve of Reagan's re-election bid, the [[Sacramento Bee|Sacramento ''Bee'']] published two articles about Laxalt's business dealings while his family owned the [[Ormsby House]], a hotel-casino in [[Carson City]], in the early 1970s. The articles claimed that certain Federal agents had alleged that the casino had been skimmed of profits while owned by the Laxalt family. Laxalt sued the ''Bee'' for libel, claiming that the articles' allegations were false, and that the implication that Laxalt associated with members of organized crime was defamatory. He also denied knowing about skimming activities and, in fact, denied that any skimming whatsoever had taken place.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nLaxalt sought $250 million in damages. In 1987, the lawsuit was settled. In a statement, the ''Bee'' acknowledged that pretrial discovery \"had not shown that there was a skim\" at the Ormsby House. Laxalt declared that pretrial investigations had found no evidence of the wrongdoing at issue. The ''Bee'' maintained that it did not commit libel because it had not stated that Laxalt was involved in wrongdoing; it had merely reported that a third party held suspicions that wrongdoing had taken place at the Ormsby House. Under the settlement, the two sides agreed to allow the question of attorneys' fees to be decided by a panel of former federal judges.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn March 1988, after an extensive review, the judges awarded Laxalt $647,452.52 in fees and costs. One of the panelists, former [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Griffin Bell]], who had served under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]], said that he would have preferred awarding $2 million, but he felt the final amount was \"fair.\" ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the judges' decision as a \"slap\" at the ''Bee'' newspapers. Laxalt was quoted as saying that the case had proven the ''Bee''{{'}}s allegations to be without basis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964635,00.html|date=June 15, 1987 |access-date=August 11, 2007 |title=American Notes Lawsuits|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>\n\n===1988 presidential election===\nLaxalt retired from the Senate in 1987 and was replaced by the man he had defeated in [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1974|1974]], [[Harry Reid]], who would go on to become the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] and the longest-serving [[List of United States Senators from Nevada|U.S. Senator from Nevada]]. Laxalt made a brief run for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1988|Republican presidential nomination]] for the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]] in 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a leg up in organization, but also many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[George H. W. Bush presidential campaign, 1988|successful presidential campaign]]. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in [[Bob Dole]]'s failed presidential bid in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==After politics==\nLaxalt was a partner in the [[New York City]]-based law firm of [[Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey]]<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1F3DF932A25752C1A961948260 \"Finley, Kumble, Major Law Firm, Facing Revamping or Dissolution\"], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> and its successor law firm, [[Washington, Perito & Dubuc|Laxalt, Washington, Perito & Dubuc]]. He later formed a small government consulting firm known as The Paul Laxalt Group. After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, Laxalt was named by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W.

The 60,000-square-foot building houses classrooms and laboratories for mining engineering, chemical and materials engineering, and geological sciences.

1971 and a [[United States Senator]] from 1974 to 1987. He was one of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s closest friends in politics. After Reagan was elected [[President of the United States|President]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], many in the national press referred to Laxalt as \"The First Friend.\" He was the older brother of [[Robert Laxalt]], who was a noted and prolific writer. He was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Early life, education, and early career==\nLaxalt was born on August 2, 1922 in [[Reno, Nevada]]. He was the son of [[Basque people|Basque]] parents, Therese (Alpetche)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5MUAQAAIAAJ&q=Therese+Alpetche+Laxalt&dq=Therese+Alpetche+Laxalt&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K9Y6VfgzydawBe_jgbAJ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg|title=Mothers of achievement in American history, 1776-1976: Bi-centennial project, 1974-1976|first=|last=American Mothers Committee|date=August 1, 1976|publisher=C.

A shepherd, Dominique became wealthy in the sheep industry. After losing everything in the early 1920s, he returned to shepherding for the rest of his career. Therese, who had been trained at Paris's [[Le Cordon Bleu|Cordon Bleu]] cooking school, eventually opened a restaurant called The French Hotel in [[Carson City, Nevada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nevadawomen.org/research-center/biographies-alphabetical/therese-alpetche-laxalt/|title=THER\u00c9SE ALPETCHE LAXALT - Nevada Women's History Project|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nTherese and Dominique had six children: Paul, [[Robert Laxalt|Robert]] (born in 1923), Suzanne (1925), John (1926), Marie (1928) and Peter (1931). Robert became an author; Suzanne, a Roman Catholic nun; John, a lawyer and political consultant; Marie, a school teacher; and Peter (Mick), an attorney.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The Laxalt children were raised largely by their mother, as Dominique spent long periods of time away from the household tending his sheep in the deserts and mountains of Nevada. The children all helped Therese at The French Hotel. It was there that Paul first acquired an interest in politics as he listened in on the conversations of the politicians who patronized the restaurant (including the legendary [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Pat McCarran]]).\n\nPaul played on the 1938 state basketball champion team at [[Carson High School (Carson City, Nevada)|Carson High School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/paul-laxalt-former-nevada-governor-senator-dies-at-96/|title=Paul Laxalt, former Nevada governor, senator, dies at 96|date=August 7, 2018|publisher=}}</ref> before graduating and attending Santa Clara University. When World War II broke out, Paul joined the U.S. Army and served as a medic, seeing action in the [[Battle of Leyte]] in the Philippines. After the war, he graduated from the [[University of Denver]] (1949) law school.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.denverpost.com/2006/03/01/du-honors-its-alumni-of-distinction/ |title= DU honors its alumni of distinction |work= [[The Denver Post]] | last= Davidson |first= Joanne |date= March 1, 2006 |access-date= May 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from law school and after serving as a district attorney, Laxalt enjoyed a successful career as a lawyer. His clients included George Whittell, who owned a large portion of the Lake Tahoe frontage on the Nevada side of the lake, Harvey and Llewellyn Gross, who built and ran Harvey's Wagon Wheel on Lake Tahoe's south shore, and Dick Graves, founder of the Sparks Nugget. While representing Graves, Laxalt helped win the famous \"Golden Rooster case\" in which the federal government tried to confiscate a 15-pound solid gold rooster that Graves displayed near the entrance of his Golden Rooster restaurant.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://author.doresabanning.com/2016/07/20/golden-rooster-advertising-or-art/ |title= Golden Rooster: Advertising or Art? |last= Banning |first= Doresa |date= July 20, 2016 |access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nPaul Laxalt's first attempt for public office was in 1950 when he ran for [[District Attorney]] of [[Ormsby County, Nevada]], turning out the incumbent D.A. He served from 1950 to 1954. Laxalt's first run for statewide office came in 1962 when he ran for [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nevada|Lieutenant Governor]] against former [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Berkeley L. Bunker]]. Using innovative television ads and personal television appearances, Laxalt was able to introduce himself to the electorate, particularly in Southern Nevada where he was virtually unknown. In the middle of the campaign, at a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] rally in Las Vegas, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial candidate and then-[[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nevada|Lt. Gov.]] [[Rex Bell]], a former Hollywood actor who had persuaded Laxalt to run with him on the GOP \"ticket\", died of a heart attack. A great amount of pressure was applied to Laxalt to run in Bell's place, but the young attorney demurred, and he remained in the lieutenant governor's race. He ended up defeating Bunker by a comfortable margin. Laxalt served one term as lieutenant governor from 1963 to 1967.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===1964 U.S. Senate run===\nIn [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1964|1964]], while serving as lieutenant governor, Laxalt ran for the [[United States Senate]] against freshman [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Howard Cannon]]. Laxalt had wanted to remain lieutenant governor. However, he declared his candidacy in mid-1964 after no other serious Republican contenders expressed interest. He did not have to give up his lieutenant governor's post for this race, since he was not up for reelection until 1966.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nRepublican candidates, running concurrently with the 1964 federal election, were undermined by the unpopularity of [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Barry Goldwater]] [[List of United States Senators from Arizona|from]] [[Arizona]], the [[List of United States Republican Party presidential tickets|Republican nominee]] for [[President of the United States|President]] against incumbent [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and the leader of their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt's advisors told him he should \"duck\" Goldwater, as they feared any association with Goldwater would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his \"political Godfather\", reportedly told his aides, \"Listen, Barry Goldwater is my friend. If I snubbed him now, I could never look him in the face again. I would rather lose.\" The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner. The next morning he flew to Las Vegas where he was told that certain precincts reported late and that Cannon had won by 48 votes, among the [[List of close election results|narrowest margins]] in a popular election for the U.S. Senate. The race was the subject of intense controversy for years.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Governor===\n[[File:Governor Laxalt.jpg|thumb|Governor Laxalt]]\nLaxalt then decided to challenge two-term [[List of Governors of Nevada|Gov.]] [[Grant Sawyer]]. Although the election would not take place until November of [[Nevada gubernatorial election, 1966|1966]], Laxalt launched his campaign in the middle of 1965. One of the most hotly debated issues during the campaign was the federal government's involvement in Nevada gaming operations. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and Justice Department had deep suspicions about organized crime's involvement in the gambling industry. Sawyer took the position that the federal government should stay out of Nevada's affairs. Laxalt took the position that Nevada had to cooperate with \"the Feds\" in order to be in a position to regulate gambling credibly. (In fact, one of Laxalt's first moves after his election was to meet with [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to express Nevada's desire to establish a cooperative relationship.) During the gubernatorial campaign, Laxalt also led a movement to purge members of the [[John Birch Society]] from the [[Nevada Republican Party|state Republican Party]]. Sawyer was defeated by an unexpectedly wide margin (nearly 6,000 votes). Laxalt served one term as governor, from January 1967 to January 1971.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nLaxalt's tenure as governor was noteworthy for coinciding with the purchase of several hotel-[[casino]]s by reclusive billionaire [[Howard Hughes]]. Laxalt allowed Hughes to secure his gaming license without appearing before the state's gaming regulatory authorities because he thought having an internationally acclaimed businessman involved in Nevada gaming would send a positive signal about the legitimacy of the industry. Laxalt also supported corporate ownership of gaming operations in Nevada, which helped pave the way for modern-day gambling. With the financial support of Hughes, Laxalt helped establish the state's first [[community college]]s and Nevada's first medical school.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAlong with [[Governor of California|Gov.]] [[Ronald Reagan]] of neighboring [[California]], Laxalt helped create the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, to protect scenic [[Lake Tahoe]]. He also expanded the park system and promoted prison reform in Nevada. On one occasion, Laxalt, against the advice of his staff, went to the [[Nevada State Prison|Nevada State Penitentiary]] during a prisoner uprising. He met personally with several prisoners who described to the governor the deplorable conditions under which they were living. Laxalt sympathized with their concerns and ordered the prison staff to address the problems. When he was later asked by the media if he had qualms about entering the prison yard, Laxalt, a former trial lawyer, said, \"No, not really. Many of them were my former clients!\"{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 1970, Laxalt lobbied [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] to reduce the prison sentence of notorious [[Teamster]] leader [[Jimmy Hoffa]] after Hoffa was convicted of attempting to bribe [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Howard Cannon]], whom Laxalt had unsuccessfully challenged in [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1964|1964]]. While governor, Laxalt worked with Teamster officials on gambling investments in Nevada.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Langdon|first1=Dolly|title=Will Reagan Ride Again in '84?

Laxalt did not seek a second term. He bequeathed a budget surplus to his successor, [[List of Governors of Nevada|Gov.]] [[Mike O'Callaghan]]. He left office saying that he had \"a gut-full\" of politics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Richard|title=The Maverick Spirit|year=1999|publisher=University of Nevada Press|location=Reno and Las Vegas.

In [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1974|1974]], when twenty-year [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Alan Bible]] announced his retirement, Republican political insiders pressed Laxalt to re-enter politics and seek the open U.S. Senate seat. He eventually agreed and wound up running against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, then-[[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nevada|Lt. Gov.]] [[Harry Reid]]. At that time the [[Watergate scandal]] was a burden for all Republicans running for national office in [[United States elections, 1974|1974]]. Nonetheless, early in the campaign, Laxalt enjoyed a consistent but tight lead over Reid in most polls. However, after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] pardoned former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], Laxalt's prospects, like Republican prospects everywhere, suddenly took a dramatic turn for the worse. Laxalt compared it to having \"a hundred pound weight around my neck.\" Still, he managed a victory by fewer than one thousand votes. To give Laxalt a leg-up in seniority, Sen. Bible resigned three weeks early on December 18, 1974. [[List of Governors of Nevada|Gov.]] [[Mike O'Callaghan]] (Laxalt's successor as governor) appointed Laxalt to finish out Bible's term.\n\nIn [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1980|1980]], Laxalt won re-election over former [[Nevada Senate|state Sen.]] [[Mary Gojack]] with 59% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-15/local/me-2270_1_nevada-senate |title=Ex-Nevada Lawmaker Mary Gojack Dies : Former Blackjack Dealer Fought on Behalf of Women, Minorities |date=November 15, 1985 |access-date=August 7, 2018 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n====Senate tenure====\n[[File:PaulLaxalt.JPG|thumb|Senate picture]]\nIn his first term in the [[United States Senate]], Laxalt was active in many legislative battles. In 1977, he led the fight against [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]'s proposal to transfer the [[Panama Canal]] to the [[Panama]]nian government. Despite being in the minority in the Senate, Laxalt helped build a coalition opposed to the [[Panama Canal Treaties]]. Opponents successfully built a grassroots campaign designed to put pressure on the Senate. On the day of the vote, Laxalt was confident that he would be able to secure the 34 votes needed to defeat the treaties. However, his colleague, [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Howard Cannon]] (also from Nevada), decided to support the treaties. Even in defeat, Laxalt had won plaudits from both sides of the aisle for the manner in which he led the opposition. Indeed, throughout his Senate tenure, Laxalt remained popular among his colleagues, principally because he was viewed as a \"straight shooter\" and someone who never allowed political differences to turn personal. He was good friends with conservative [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Jesse Helms]] [[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|from]] [[North Carolina]] and liberal [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Ted Kennedy]] [[List of United States Senators from Massachusetts|from]] [[Massachusetts]]. (At the request of Sen. Kennedy, Laxalt arranged to have [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] present [[Ethel Kennedy]] with the original copy of the medal honoring her late husband [[Robert F. Kennedy]].){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nDuring Laxalt's two terms in the U.S. Senate, he served on several influential committees, including the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Labor and Public Welfare Committee]], the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], and the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]]. When [[United States Senate elections, 1980|Republicans took control of the Senate in 1981]], Laxalt became chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Regulatory Reform Subcommittee, and the Appropriations Committee's State, Justice and Commerce Subcommittee. In 1986, while serving on the Judiciary Committee, Laxalt played a key behind-the-scenes role in securing the committee's approval of President Reagan's nomination of then-[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] for [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Negotiating principally with Sen. Ted Kennedy and [[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Joe Biden]] [[List of United States Senators from Delaware|from]] [[Delaware]], Laxalt was able to strike a deal that allowed the committee to vote on the nomination.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Rehnquist was subsequently approved by the full Senate by a margin of 65&ndash;33.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Relationship with Ronald Reagan===\n[[File:Paul Laxalt and Ronald Reagan 1980.jpg|thumb|right|Senator Laxalt and then-candidate Reagan during the 1980 campaign]]\n[[File:C17592-20a.jpg|thumb|right|Laxalt, his wife, Carol, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]], [[Bob Michel]] and his wife, Corrine, watch the Oak Ridge Boys performance during the Barbecue for Members of Congress on the South Lawn in 1983]] \nLaxalt had become close friends with [[Ronald Reagan]] during his time as governor, when Reagan was also in his first term as governor of neighboring [[California]]. They worked on many issues of mutual interest to both states, particularly those dealing with the preservation of [[Lake Tahoe]]. During Reagan's presidency, Laxalt was sometimes referred to as \"The First Friend\".<ref name=\"FirstFriend\">{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Roberts |title=Reagan's First Friend |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/magazine/reagan-s-first-friend.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=A.26 |date=March 21, 1982 }}</ref> Laxalt was national chairman of three Reagan presidential campaigns and placed Reagan's name in nomination at the [[Republican National Convention]]s of [[1976 Republican National Convention|1976]], [[1980 Republican National Convention|1980]], and [[1984 Republican National Convention|1984]]. During the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], Laxalt's name was floated as a potential [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] nominee for the Reagan ticket, but [[George H. W. Bush]] was chosen instead.<ref>[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3492521.html \"How the Bush Dynasty Almost Wasn't\"], ''Hoover Digest''</ref> At the behest of President Reagan, Laxalt served in the then-unprecedented role of General Chairman of the Republican Party from 1983 to 1987.\n \nIn fact, during Laxalt's second Senate term, due in large measure to his relationship with Reagan, several Nevadans came to Washington, D.C. to serve in prominent governmental and campaign positions. His long-time aide, [[Barbara Vucanovich]], had been elected to serve in the House in 1982, becoming the first female elected to a federal position from Nevada. A long-time friend and prominent Nevada trial attorney, [[Frank Fahrenkopf]], was elected to serve as Chairman of the Republican National Committee where he helped oversee [[1984 United States presidential election|Reagan's re-election]] and the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]]. Bob Broadbent of [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]] became Assistant Secretary for Water and Science in the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]; Bob Horton of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] became Director of the Bureau of Mines; Cameron Batjer of Reno, a former [[Supreme Court of Nevada|Nevada Supreme Court]] [[List of justices of the Supreme Court of Nevada|Justice]], served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission; Reese Taylor of [[Las Vegas]] served as Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission; and Ed Allison of Reno, [[Sig Rogich]] of Las Vegas, and [[Ralph V. Whitworth]] of [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]] all served in key roles in Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign. Laxalt's former Press Secretary and Chief of Staff, Tom Loranger, joined Laxalt in his post-Senate government consulting practice and now runs the D.C. office of the Ferraro Group, a Nevada government-relations firm founded by former Laxalt aide Greg Ferraro. In early 1987, Laxalt was at the top of the short list to replace [[Donald Regan]] as [[White House Chief of Staff]], but he declined because he intended to run for President in 1988. Instead, he recommended former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Majority [[Howard Baker]], who took the job.<ref>Lamar, Jacob V. Jr. (March 9, 1987), [http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,963713,00.html \"Cover Stories\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\nIt was the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Republican presidential race]] that may have cemented the tight political friendship between Laxalt and former-[[Governor of California|Gov.]] Reagan. In 1976, Reagan had decided to [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1976|run for president]], challenging [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] for the Republican nomination. Ford enjoyed widespread support among the Republican establishment, particularly in Washington, D.C. Reagan decided that having Laxalt serve as his national chairman would give his campaign credibility it was otherwise lacking. Although Laxalt was not well-known on a national level, he was well liked and respected in the U.S. Congress, and he was similarly respected by many prominent members of the national media. Laxalt eventually acceded to Reagan's request, even though doing so severely jeopardized his relationship with the Ford White House. Laxalt campaigned all over the United States on behalf of Reagan, often campaigning by his side.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nWith his back to the wall, Reagan won shocking victories in North Carolina and Texas, which propelled the race all the way to the national convention in Kansas City. Laxalt nominated Reagan at the convention. Eventually, the Reagan campaign lost a key procedural vote to Ford and the sitting President eked out a victory. Although he was on the losing side, Laxalt's national profile increased dramatically as a result of his efforts on behalf of Reagan. When Reagan defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], with Laxalt again serving as national chairman of [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|Reagan's campaign]], Laxalt's profile rose even higher.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Sacramento ''Bee'' libel suit====\nAs a long-time public official in Nevada, where individuals with alleged ties to organized crime were prominent in the early Las Vegas gaming industry, Laxalt came under scrutiny for his relationships with certain individuals. In 1983, during Laxalt's second Senate term and on the eve of Reagan's re-election bid, the [[Sacramento Bee|Sacramento ''Bee'']] published two articles about Laxalt's business dealings while his family owned the [[Ormsby House]], a hotel-casino in [[Carson City]], in the early 1970s. The articles claimed that certain Federal agents had alleged that the casino had been skimmed of profits while owned by the Laxalt family. Laxalt sued the ''Bee'' for libel, claiming that the articles' allegations were false, and that the implication that Laxalt associated with members of organized crime was defamatory. He also denied knowing about skimming activities and, in fact, denied that any skimming whatsoever had taken place.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nLaxalt sought $250 million in damages. In 1987, the lawsuit was settled. In a statement, the ''Bee'' acknowledged that pretrial discovery \"had not shown that there was a skim\" at the Ormsby House. Laxalt declared that pretrial investigations had found no evidence of the wrongdoing at issue. The ''Bee'' maintained that it did not commit libel because it had not stated that Laxalt was involved in wrongdoing; it had merely reported that a third party held suspicions that wrongdoing had taken place at the Ormsby House. Under the settlement, the two sides agreed to allow the question of attorneys' fees to be decided by a panel of former federal judges.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn March 1988, after an extensive review, the judges awarded Laxalt $647,452.52 in fees and costs. One of the panelists, former [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Griffin Bell]], who had served under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]], said that he would have preferred awarding $2 million, but he felt the final amount was \"fair.\" ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the judges' decision as a \"slap\" at the ''Bee'' newspapers. Laxalt was quoted as saying that the case had proven the ''Bee''{{'}}s allegations to be without basis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964635,00.html|date=June 15, 1987 |access-date=August 11, 2007 |title=American Notes Lawsuits|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>\n\n===1988 presidential election===\nLaxalt retired from the Senate in 1987 and was replaced by the man he had defeated in [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 1974|1974]], [[Harry Reid]], who would go on to become the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] and the longest-serving [[List of United States Senators from Nevada|U.S. Senator from Nevada]]. Laxalt made a brief run for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1988|Republican presidential nomination]] for the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]] in 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a leg up in organization, but also many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[George H. W. Bush presidential campaign, 1988|successful presidential campaign]]. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in [[Bob Dole]]'s failed presidential bid in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==After politics==\nLaxalt was a partner in the [[New York City]]-based law firm of [[Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey]]<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1F3DF932A25752C1A961948260 \"Finley, Kumble, Major Law Firm, Facing Revamping or Dissolution\"], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> and its successor law firm, [[Washington, Perito & Dubuc|Laxalt, Washington, Perito & Dubuc]]. He later formed a small government consulting firm known as The Paul Laxalt Group.

The Paul Laxalt Mineral Engineering Center, an $11 million building that was completed in 1983, has been described as a giant step forward for the University of Nevada-Reno and the School of Mines. The 60,000-square-foot building houses classrooms and laboratories for mining engineering, chemical and materials engineering, and geological sciences. The Paul Laxalt State Building in Carson City was formerly the U.S. Post Office (built in 1891) and the first Federal building erected in Nevada. It is located in the center of Carson City's Historic District.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOne of Laxalt's initiatives that gave him great personal satisfaction was the \"Intern\" program he established during his two terms in the [[United States Senate]].
