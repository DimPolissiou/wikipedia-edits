They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n{{main|Roman dictator}}\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|align=right|image1=2017 Freedom House world map.png|image2=EIU Democracy Index 2017.svg|caption1=Country ratings from Freedom House's ''Freedom in the World 2017'' survey concerning the state of world freedom in 2016<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf Freedom in The World 2017 - Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727054703/https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf |date=2017-07-27 }} by ''Freedom House'', January 31, 2017</ref>\n<center>{{legend inline|#16A983|Free (86)}} {{legend inline|#E5B63B|Partly Free (59)}} {{legend inline|#6973A5|Not Free (50)}}</center>|caption2=2017 [[Democracy Index]] by ''[[The Economist]]'' in which countries marked in different shades of red of are considered undemocratic, with many being dictatorships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|title=Democracy Index 2017 - Economist Intelligence Unit|last=|first=|date=|website=EIU.com|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218214151/http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></center>}}\nAs late as the second half of the 19th century, the term ''dictator'' had occasional positive implications. For example, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the national leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lajos-Kossuth</ref> When creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. \n   \nPast that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''\".<ref name=\"guardian_obit\">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205070235/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |archive-date=2013-12-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with the regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator.

In some cases, this is perfectly legitimate; [[Francisco Franco]] was a lieutenant general in the Spanish Army before he became [[Head of state|Chief of State]] of [[Spain]]; [[Manuel Noriega]] was officially commander of the [[Panama]]nian Defense Forces. In other cases, the association is mere pretense.\n\nSome dictators have been masters of [[crowd manipulation]], such as Mussolini and Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Stalin and Franco.  Typically the dictator's people seize control of all media, censor or destroy the opposition, and give strong doses of [[propaganda]] daily, often built around a [[cult of personality]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Morstein |first=Marx Fritz |display-authors=etal |title=Propaganda and Dictatorship |publisher=Princeton UP |isbn=978-1406747249|date=March 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Modern usage in formal titles ==\n[[File:Ritratto di Giuseppe Garibaldi - Salvatore Lo Forte.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] proclaimed himself dictator of Sicily in 1860.]]\n[[File:Gen Aguinaldo.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Emilio Aguinaldo]], [[Dictatorial Government of the Philippines|Dictator of the Philippines]], 1889]]\nBecause of its negative and pejorative [[connotation]]s, modern authoritarian leaders very rarely (if ever) use the term ''dictator'' in their formal titles, instead they most often simply have title of [[President (government title)|president]].

The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.\n* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].\n* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].\nNote that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion. [[Monarch]]s and [[Military dictatorship|military dictators]] are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the [[nobility]] or the [[army]])..\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Authoritarian personality]]\n* [[Benevolent dictator for life]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Dictator novel]]\n* [[Emergency powers]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts by country]]\n* [[List of political leaders who held active military ranks in office]]\n* [[List of political leaders who suspended the constitution]]\n* [[Lists of state leaders by year]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Military rule (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)]]\n*[[Supreme leader|Supreme Leader]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n* A&nbsp;{{note|Doctorate}}He conferred a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] on himself from [[Makerere University]].<ref name=Byword>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |title=Idi Amin: a byword for brutality |work=[[News24]] |accessdate=2007-12-02 |date=2003-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605070641/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 }}</ref>\n* B&nbsp;{{note|VC}}The Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>Lloyd, Lorna (2007) p.239</ref>\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book| last=Bunce & Wolchik| first=Valerie, Sharon L.| ref=Bunce & Wolchik| year=2012| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=-IRc_W_YBV0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Socialism+Vanquished,+Socialism+Challenged:+Eastern+Europe+and+China,+1989-2009| title= Socialism Vanquished, Socialism Challenged: Eastern Europe and China, 1989-2009 | accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9780199996261}}\n* {{cite book| last=Issac| first=Jeffrey C.| ref=Issac| year=2000| publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=1pl5T45FwIwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Between+Past+and+Future:+The+Revolutions+of+1989+and+Their+Aftermath| title= Between Past and Future: The Revolutions of 1989 and Their Aftermath| accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9789639116719}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Pavlowitch\n  | first = Stevan K.\n  | year = 2002\n  | chapter = \n  | title = Serbia: The History of an Idea\n  | page = 128\n  | publisher = [[New York University Press]]\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u46G_l3Cz20C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serbia:+The+History+of+an+Idea\n  | isbn = 978-0-8147-6708-5\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* [http://www.planetrulers.com/current-dictators Current Dictators of the World]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/ WorldStatesmen]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dictatorship| ]]\n[[Category:Heads of government]]\n[[Category:Heads of state]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Titles of national or ethnic leadership]]\n\n[[cs:Dikt\u00e1tor]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the ancient Roman title|Roman dictator|other uses}}\n{{redirect|Dictators|the American band|The Dictators}}\n{{short description|Political leader who possesses absolute power}}\n[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Green Caesar|Bust of Julius Caesar]], first lifetime dictator of the Roman Republic, who through a series of legal maneuvers transformed the state into a legal autocracy.

They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n{{main|Roman dictator}}\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|align=right|image1=2017 Freedom House world map.png|image2=EIU Democracy Index 2017.svg|caption1=Country ratings from Freedom House's ''Freedom in the World 2017'' survey concerning the state of world freedom in 2016<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf Freedom in The World 2017 - Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727054703/https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf |date=2017-07-27 }} by ''Freedom House'', January 31, 2017</ref>\n<center>{{legend inline|#16A983|Free (86)}} {{legend inline|#E5B63B|Partly Free (59)}} {{legend inline|#6973A5|Not Free (50)}}</center>|caption2=2017 [[Democracy Index]] by ''[[The Economist]]'' in which countries marked in different shades of red of are considered undemocratic, with many being dictatorships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|title=Democracy Index 2017 - Economist Intelligence Unit|last=|first=|date=|website=EIU.com|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218214151/http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></center>}}\nAs late as the second half of the 19th century, the term ''dictator'' had occasional positive implications. For example, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the national leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lajos-Kossuth</ref> When creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. \n   \nPast that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''\".<ref name=\"guardian_obit\">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205070235/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |archive-date=2013-12-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with the regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator.

The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.\n* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].\n* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].\nNote that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion. [[Monarch]]s and [[Military dictatorship|military dictators]] are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the [[nobility]] or the [[army]])..\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Authoritarian personality]]\n* [[Benevolent dictator for life]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Dictator novel]]\n* [[Emergency powers]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts by country]]\n* [[List of political leaders who held active military ranks in office]]\n* [[List of political leaders who suspended the constitution]]\n* [[Lists of state leaders by year]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Military rule (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)]]\n*[[Supreme leader|Supreme Leader]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n* A&nbsp;{{note|Doctorate}}He conferred a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] on himself from [[Makerere University]].<ref name=Byword>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |title=Idi Amin: a byword for brutality |work=[[News24]] |accessdate=2007-12-02 |date=2003-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605070641/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 }}</ref>\n* B&nbsp;{{note|VC}}The Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>Lloyd, Lorna (2007) p.239</ref>\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book| last=Bunce & Wolchik| first=Valerie, Sharon L.| ref=Bunce & Wolchik| year=2012| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=-IRc_W_YBV0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Socialism+Vanquished,+Socialism+Challenged:+Eastern+Europe+and+China,+1989-2009| title= Socialism Vanquished, Socialism Challenged: Eastern Europe and China, 1989-2009 | accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9780199996261}}\n* {{cite book| last=Issac| first=Jeffrey C.| ref=Issac| year=2000| publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=1pl5T45FwIwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Between+Past+and+Future:+The+Revolutions+of+1989+and+Their+Aftermath| title= Between Past and Future: The Revolutions of 1989 and Their Aftermath| accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9789639116719}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Pavlowitch\n  | first = Stevan K.\n  | year = 2002\n  | chapter = \n  | title = Serbia: The History of an Idea\n  | page = 128\n  | publisher = [[New York University Press]]\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u46G_l3Cz20C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serbia:+The+History+of+an+Idea\n  | isbn = 978-0-8147-6708-5\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* [http://www.planetrulers.com/current-dictators Current Dictators of the World]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/ WorldStatesmen]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dictatorship| ]]\n[[Category:Heads of government]]\n[[Category:Heads of state]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Titles of national or ethnic leadership]]\n\n[[cs:Dikt\u00e1tor]]\n", "name_user": "Pastasauce1234", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator"}

Approximately 23% of direct incident radiation of total [[sunlight]] is removed from the direct solar beam  by scattering into the atmosphere; of this amount (of incident radiation)  about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as [[photon diffusion|photon diffused]] skylight radiation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere are [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie scattering]]; they are [[elastic scattering|elastic]], meaning that a photon of light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and without changing wavelength.\n\nUnder an overcast sky, there is no direct sunlight and all light results from diffused skylight radiation.\n\nProceeding from analyses of the aftermath of the eruption of the Philippines volcano Mount Pinatubo (in June 1991) and other studies:<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>  Diffused skylight, owing to its intrinsic structure and behavior, can illuminate under-canopy leaves, permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case; this in stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies with direct sunlight that casts shadows onto understory leaves and thereby limits plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer, [[#The diffused skylight effect|(see below)]].\n\n==Color==\n[[Image:Trees-sky.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clear blue sky]]\nThe [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] scatters short-[[wavelength]] light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths.

Scattering varies as a function of the ratio of particle diameters (of particulates in the atmosphere) to the wavelength of the incident radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, [[Rayleigh scattering]] occurs.  (In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios scattering varies in a more complex fashion, as described for spherical particles by the [[Mie theory]].) The laws of [[geometric optics]] begin to apply at higher ratios.\n\nDaily at any global venue experiencing  [[sunrise]] or [[sunset]], most of the solar beam of visible sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to Earth's surface. Here the trajectory of sunlight through the atmosphere is elongated such that much of the blue or green light is scattered away from the line of perceivable visible light. This phenomenon leaves the Sun's rays, and the clouds they illuminate, abundantly orange-to-red in colors, which one sees when looking at a sunset or sunrise.\n\nFor the example of the Sun at zenith, during broad daylight, the sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering, which also involves the [[diatomic]] gases [[nitrogen|{{chem|N|2}}]] and [[oxygen|{{chem|O|2}}]]. Near sunset and especially during twilight, absorption by [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}) significantly contributes to maintaining blue color in the evening sky.\n\n==Neutral points==\nFour commonly detectable points have zero [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of diffuse sky radiation. These ''neutral points'' lie along the [[vertical circle]] through the center of the [[Sun]]'s disk and the [[antisolar point]].\n*The '''Arago point''', named after [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|its discoverer]], is customarily located at about 20\u00b0 above the antisolar point, but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air. The latter property makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric [[turbidity]].\n*The '''Babinet point''', discovered by [[Jacques Babinet]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 above the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The '''Brewster point''', discovered by [[David Brewster]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 below the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The fourth point, located at about 20\u00b0 below the antisolar point, is visible only at higher altitudes in the air or in space.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Horv\u00e1th |first1=G |last2=Bern\u00e1th |first2=B |last3=Suhai |first3=B |last4=Barta |first4=A |last5=Wehner |first5=R |title=First observation of the fourth neutral polarization point in the atmosphere |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=October 2002 |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=2085\u201399 |pmid=12365628|bibcode=2002JOSAA..19.2085H |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.19.002085 }}</ref>\n\n==Under an overcast sky==\nThere is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse sky radiation.

Also called '''sky radiation''', '''diffuse skylight''', or just '''skylight''', it is the determinative process for changing the colors of the [[sky]]. Approximately 23% of direct incident radiation of total [[sunlight]] is removed from the direct solar beam  by scattering into the atmosphere; of this amount (of incident radiation)  about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as [[photon diffusion|photon diffused]] skylight radiation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere are [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie scattering]]; they are [[elastic scattering|elastic]], meaning that a photon of light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and without changing wavelength.\n\nUnder an overcast sky, there is no direct sunlight and all light results from diffused skylight radiation.\n\nProceeding from analyses of the aftermath of the eruption of the Philippines volcano Mount Pinatubo (in June 1991) and other studies:<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>  Diffused skylight, owing to its intrinsic structure and behavior, can illuminate under-canopy leaves, permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case; this in stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies with direct sunlight that casts shadows onto understory leaves and thereby limits plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer, [[#The diffused skylight effect|(see below)]].\n\n==Color==\n[[Image:Trees-sky.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clear blue sky]]\nThe [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] scatters short-[[wavelength]] light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths.

Scattering varies as a function of the ratio of particle diameters (of particulates in the atmosphere) to the wavelength of the incident radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, [[Rayleigh scattering]] occurs.  (In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios scattering varies in a more complex fashion, as described for spherical particles by the [[Mie theory]].) The laws of [[geometric optics]] begin to apply at higher ratios.\n\nDaily at any global venue experiencing  [[sunrise]] or [[sunset]], most of the solar beam of visible sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to Earth's surface. Here the trajectory of sunlight through the atmosphere is elongated such that much of the blue or green light is scattered away from the line of perceivable visible light. This phenomenon leaves the Sun's rays, and the clouds they illuminate, abundantly orange-to-red in colors, which one sees when looking at a sunset or sunrise.\n\nFor the example of the Sun at zenith, during broad daylight, the sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering, which also involves the [[diatomic]] gases [[nitrogen|{{chem|N|2}}]] and [[oxygen|{{chem|O|2}}]]. Near sunset and especially during twilight, absorption by [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}) significantly contributes to maintaining blue color in the evening sky.\n\n==Neutral points==\nFour commonly detectable points have zero [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of diffuse sky radiation. These ''neutral points'' lie along the [[vertical circle]] through the center of the [[Sun]]'s disk and the [[antisolar point]].\n*The '''Arago point''', named after [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|its discoverer]], is customarily located at about 20\u00b0 above the antisolar point, but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air. The latter property makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric [[turbidity]].\n*The '''Babinet point''', discovered by [[Jacques Babinet]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 above the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The '''Brewster point''', discovered by [[David Brewster]] in 1840, is located about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 below the Sun; hence, it is difficult to observe because of solar glare.\n*The fourth point, located at about 20\u00b0 below the antisolar point, is visible only at higher altitudes in the air or in space.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Horv\u00e1th |first1=G |last2=Bern\u00e1th |first2=B |last3=Suhai |first3=B |last4=Barta |first4=A |last5=Wehner |first5=R |title=First observation of the fourth neutral polarization point in the atmosphere |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=October 2002 |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=2085\u201399 |pmid=12365628|bibcode=2002JOSAA..19.2085H |doi=10.1364/JOSAA.19.002085 }}</ref>\n\n==Under an overcast sky==\nThere is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky, so all light is then diffuse sky radiation.

He played the main role in Mika's film ''[[The Liar (1981 film)|The Liar]]'' (1981). Together they founded the production company Villealfa Filmproductions and later the [[Midnight Sun Film Festival]]. His debut as an independent director was ''Crime and Punishment'' (1983), an adaptation of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s novel set in modern [[Helsinki]]. He gained worldwide attention with ''[[Leningrad Cowboys Go America]]'' (1989). In 1989 he emigrated with his wife, Paula Oinonen, to Portugal, saying \"in all of Helsinki there is no place left where I could place my camera\".<ref>Ralph Eue and Linda S\u00f6ffker (eds.): ''Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki'' (film: 13).

The dialogue is famously laconic: the articulation is unadorned, direct and in strict standard language, without showing much emotion or drama. Characters frequently stand still and recite the dialogue as if it consisted of eternal truths or nothing at all. These characters rarely smile, nod sadly, and smoke constantly. The camera is usually still.<ref>Ebert, Roger, The Man Without A Past, Chicago Sun-Times, 27.6.2003. http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030627/REVIEWS/306270306/1023</ref> Events are shown in a plain manner and characters are usually left alone facing the consequences. However, despite their tragedies and setbacks, the characters don't give up and eventually survive.<ref name=\"filmgoer\" />\n\nMuch of Kaurism\u00e4ki's work is centred on Helsinki, such as the film ''Calamari Union'', the Proletariat trilogy (''Shadows in Paradise'', ''Ariel'' and ''The Match Factory Girl'') and the Finland trilogy (''Drifting Clouds'', ''The Man Without a Past'' and ''Lights in the Dusk''). His vision of Helsinki is critical and singularly unromantic. Indeed, his characters often speak about how they wish to get away from Helsinki. Some end up in [[Mexico]] (''Ariel''), others in [[Estonia]] (''Shadows in Paradise'', ''Calamari Union'', and ''Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatjana''). Kaurism\u00e4ki also uses, on purpose, characters, elements and settings that hark back to the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"filmgoer\" />\n\nKaurism\u00e4ki has been influenced by the French directors [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], [[Jacques Becker]], and [[Robert Bresson]], the Japanese director [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]], the American director [[John Cassavetes]], and some critics have also inferred the influence of [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]. His movies have a humorous side that can also be seen in the films of [[Jim Jarmusch]], who has a cameo in Kaurism\u00e4ki's film ''Leningrad Cowboys Go America''. Jarmusch used actors who have appeared frequently in Kaurism\u00e4ki's films in his own film ''[[Night on Earth]]'', part of which takes place in Helsinki.\n\nKaurism\u00e4ki has been a vocal critic of [[digital cinematography]], calling it \"a devil's invention\"<ref name=\"alanen-digital\">{{cite web|url=http://anttialanenfilmdiary.blogspot.fi/2014/03/aki-kaurismaki-crosses-digital-rubicon.html|title=Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki Crosses the Digital Rubicon|publisher=Antti Alanen: Film Diary|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> and saying he \"won't make a digital film in this life\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philonfilm.net/2012/04/interview-aki-kaurismaki.html|title=\"I am a filmmaker not a pixelmaker\" - An interview with Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki|publisher=Phil on Film|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> In March 2014, however, he reconciled, saying that \"in order to maintain my humble film oeuvre accessible to a potential audience, I have ended up in rendering it to digital in all its present and several of its as yet unknown forms.\"<ref name=\"alanen-digital\"/>\n\nIn Helsinki, Kaurism\u00e4ki is the co-owner of a complex, Andorra, that incorporates a cinema, several bars and a pool hall featuring a giant poster for [[Robert Bresson]]\u2019s ''L\u2019Argent.''

Kaurism\u00e4ki's next film ''[[Lights in the Dusk]]'' was also chosen to be Finland's nominee for best foreign-language film, but Kaurism\u00e4ki again boycotted the awards and refused the nomination, as a protest against [[United States|U.S.]] President [[George W.

He played the main role in Mika's film ''[[The Liar (1981 film)|The Liar]]'' (1981). Together they founded the production company Villealfa Filmproductions and later the [[Midnight Sun Film Festival]]. His debut as an independent director was ''Crime and Punishment'' (1983), an adaptation of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s novel set in modern [[Helsinki]]. He gained worldwide attention with ''[[Leningrad Cowboys Go America]]'' (1989). In 1989 he emigrated with his wife, Paula Oinonen, to Portugal, saying \"in all of Helsinki there is no place left where I could place my camera\".<ref>Ralph Eue and Linda S\u00f6ffker (eds.): ''Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki'' (film: 13).

The dialogue is famously laconic: the articulation is unadorned, direct and in strict standard language, without showing much emotion or drama. Characters frequently stand still and recite the dialogue as if it consisted of eternal truths or nothing at all. These characters rarely smile, nod sadly, and smoke constantly. The camera is usually still.<ref>Ebert, Roger, The Man Without A Past, Chicago Sun-Times, 27.6.2003. http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030627/REVIEWS/306270306/1023</ref> Events are shown in a plain manner and characters are usually left alone facing the consequences. However, despite their tragedies and setbacks, the characters don't give up and eventually survive.<ref name=\"filmgoer\" />\n\nMuch of Kaurism\u00e4ki's work is centred on Helsinki, such as the film ''Calamari Union'', the Proletariat trilogy (''Shadows in Paradise'', ''Ariel'' and ''The Match Factory Girl'') and the Finland trilogy (''Drifting Clouds'', ''The Man Without a Past'' and ''Lights in the Dusk''). His vision of Helsinki is critical and singularly unromantic. Indeed, his characters often speak about how they wish to get away from Helsinki. Some end up in [[Mexico]] (''Ariel''), others in [[Estonia]] (''Shadows in Paradise'', ''Calamari Union'', and ''Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatjana''). Kaurism\u00e4ki also uses, on purpose, characters, elements and settings that hark back to the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"filmgoer\" />\n\nKaurism\u00e4ki has been influenced by the French directors [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], [[Jacques Becker]], and [[Robert Bresson]], the Japanese director [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]], the American director [[John Cassavetes]], and some critics have also inferred the influence of [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]. His movies have a humorous side that can also be seen in the films of [[Jim Jarmusch]], who has a cameo in Kaurism\u00e4ki's film ''Leningrad Cowboys Go America''. Jarmusch used actors who have appeared frequently in Kaurism\u00e4ki's films in his own film ''[[Night on Earth]]'', part of which takes place in Helsinki.\n\nKaurism\u00e4ki has been a vocal critic of [[digital cinematography]], calling it \"a devil's invention\"<ref name=\"alanen-digital\">{{cite web|url=http://anttialanenfilmdiary.blogspot.fi/2014/03/aki-kaurismaki-crosses-digital-rubicon.html|title=Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki Crosses the Digital Rubicon|publisher=Antti Alanen: Film Diary|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> and saying he \"won't make a digital film in this life\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philonfilm.net/2012/04/interview-aki-kaurismaki.html|title=\"I am a filmmaker not a pixelmaker\" - An interview with Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki|publisher=Phil on Film|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> In March 2014, however, he reconciled, saying that \"in order to maintain my humble film oeuvre accessible to a potential audience, I have ended up in rendering it to digital in all its present and several of its as yet unknown forms.\"<ref name=\"alanen-digital\"/>\n\nIn Helsinki, Kaurism\u00e4ki is the co-owner of a complex, Andorra, that incorporates a cinema, several bars and a pool hall featuring a giant poster for [[Robert Bresson]]\u2019s ''L\u2019Argent.''
