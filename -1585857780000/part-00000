{"title_page": "Prostitution in Italy", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n'''Prostitution in Italy''' ({{lang-it|prostituzione}}), defined as the exchange of sexual acts for money, is legal, although organized [[prostitution]], whether indoors in [[brothels]] or controlled by third parties, is prohibited. Brothels were banned in 1958. A [[euphemism]] often used to refer to street prostitutes in Italy is ''Lucciole'' (lit. \"[[fireflies]]\"), while escorts are referred to as ''Squillo'' ([[onomatopoeia]] referring to the sound of a ringing telephone, making it analogous to \"[[call girl]]\").\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prostitute from Treviso, Italy.jpg|200px|thumb|Prostitute in a brothel of [[Treviso]]]]\nProstitution thrived in Italy in the [[Middle Ages]]. The city of [[Venice]] declared in 1358 that brothels were indispensable, and [[courtesans]] achieved high social status in Venice, particularly in the 17th century.<ref>''Leggi e Memorie Venete sulla Prostituzione''. Lorenji, Venice 1872</ref>\n\n===''Regolamentazione''===\nThe ''Regolamentazione'', or the ''regulation system of prostitution'', was established in 1861, with [[Italian unification]], modeled on the French Napoleonic system of ''[[Prostitution in France#Regulation|R\u00e9glementation]]'' and the Bureau des Moeurs (a government office tasked with regulating vice, which included officially registering prostitutes). An 1859 decree, by [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]] to aid the French army which supported the [[Piedmontese]] in their fight against Austria, authorized the opening of houses controlled by the state for the exercise of prostitution in [[Lombardy]]. On 15 February 1860, the decree was signed into law (referred to as ''Legge Cavour'') with the enactment of the \"Regulations of the Security Service on Prostitution\".\n\nA further law (''Legge Crispi''), adopted on 29 March 1888, prohibited the selling of food and drinks, and parties, dances, and songs in brothels, and banned such establishments near places of worship, schools, and kindergartens. It also provided that the shutters should always remain closed, which is the origin of the Italian expression \"closed houses\" (''case chiuse''). A further amendment was the ''Legge Nicotera'' of 1891. Under this system, prostitution in Italy was fully legal in private houses. A system of ''sifilicomi'' (hospitals for sex workers) was also set up, under the belief that they were the main sources of spreading [[venereal diseases]]. [[File:Interior of a brothel in Naples, Italy 1945 (2) - Prostitutes.jpg|300px|thumb|Prostitutes waiting for customers in a brothel of [[Naples]]]] Although prostitutes found this regulated system oppressive, they developed ways to resist it. During the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist rule]] (1922\u20131943), more restrictive measures were gradually introduced in 1923, 1933, and 1940.\nOverall, the system was considered a failure, and as in other European countries with ''R\u00e9glementation'', movement for its abolition started to grow from the late 19th century, supported by leftist and feminist groups. This ''abolitionism'' of the time is often considered confusing, since it has been applied to both the abolition of regulations restricting prostitution and the abolition of prostitution itself. However, these forces led to the introduction of a new system in Italy that abolished regulation, but not prostitution as such.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=prostitution+italy#PPA441,M1 |title=Mary Gibson: Prostitution and the State in Italy, 1860\u20131915 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location= New Jersey |year=1986 |isbn=9781563081316 }}</ref>\n\n===''Legge Merlin'' (1958)===\nThe ''Legge Merlin'' (L75/1958)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pariopportunita.gov.it/images/stories/documenti_vari/UserFiles/L_20-2-1958_n75.pdf |title=Legge 75/58 20 February 1958 \"Abolizione della regolamentazione della prostituzione e lotta contro lo sfruttamento della prostituzione altrui\" (detta \"Legge Merlin\") |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120061105/http://www.pariopportunita.gov.it/images/stories/documenti_vari/UserFiles/L_20-2-1958_n75.pdf |archivedate=20 January 2016  }}</ref>\n(the Merlin Law, named after its main author, the [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] member of parliament [[Lina Merlin]]), came into power on 20 September 1958. This law, still in force today with very little changes, revoked the regulation system, banned brothels, and established a new criminal offence called \"exploitation of prostitution\" (''sfruttamento della prostituzione'') with the aim to punish [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring of sexual services]]. Specifically, article 3.8 provides penalties for \"any person who in any way promotes or exploits the prostitution of others\" (''chiunque in qualsiasi modo favorisca o sfrutti la prostituzione altrui''). Article 3.3 lists a number of public places where prostitution is prohibited, such as houses, hotels, dance halls, and entertainment clubs. Article 5 prohibits solicitation (''libertinaggio'') \"in a public place, or place open to the public, or soliciting in a scandolous or disturbing manner, or follows a person and invites them by acts or words\".<ref>{{lang|it|\n1) che in luogo pubblico od aperto al pubblico, invitano al\nlibertinaggio in modo scandaloso o molesto;\n2) che seguono per via le persone, invitandole con atti o parole al\nlibertinaggio}}</ref>\nArticle 7 prohibited registration and mandatory health checks for prostitutes.<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"tamp09\"/><ref>3.3 chiunque, essendo proprietario, gerente o preposto a un\nalbergo, casa mobiliata, pensione, spaccio di bevande, circolo, locale da\nballo, o luogo di spettacolo, o loro annessi e dipendenze o qualunque\nlocale aperto al pubblico od utilizzato dal pubblico, vi tollera\nabitualmente la presenza di una o pi\u00f9 persone che, all'interno del locale\nstesso, si d\u00e0nno alla prostituzione (hotel, mobile home, retirement, canteen, club, meeting rooms\ndance, or place of entertainment)</ref>\n\n====Theory====\nThe Merlin Law follows the standard abolitionist (abolishing regulation) view of prostitution control policy, prohibiting trafficking, exploitation, and aiding and abetting of prostitution. What remained legal was [[street prostitution]], or independent prostitution done by a prostitute in their own home. The law was promoted as an equality measure liberating women, but despite its good intentions to give more rights to prostitutes otherwise dependent on pimps, it was and still remains to this day a subject of intense debate. Among other controversial points, the text of the law specifically refers to women (''donne'').<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"tamp09\"/>\n\n====Result====\nThe effect of the law was to push women out into the [[street prostitution|streets]], which made them more visible, and into private homes.<ref name=\"carchedi\">{{cite web|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/papers/02102862n60p85.pdf |title=Francesco Carchedi: Considerations on foreign prostitution in Italy.

The [[Christian Democracy (Italy, 1997)|Christian Democrats]] repeatedly sought the repeal of the law since 1973, and they were joined in 1998 by the [[Democrats of the Left]]. Repeal of the law would have re-opened brothels. At the same time, conservative women's groups such as [[Federcasalinghe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donne.it/ |title=Federcasalinghe |publisher=Donne.it |date=21 June 2013}}</ref>\npushed for more regulation, including as health checks, but these propositions were generally opposed by feminists.

The dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and new immigration policies (such as ''Legge Martelli'' of 1990) contributed to a rapid influx of sex workers in 1989-1990 originating from former [[Soviet bloc]] countries, giving rise to the colloquial term \"Polish Girls\" (''ragazze polacche''). A second wave of immigrant sex workers from [[Nigeria]] and [[Peru]], arriving to Italy using [[tourist visas]] and staying in the country after they had expired (the so-called ''clandestini'') ensued, followed by a third wave from [[Albania]] in 1993\u20131994. The fourth wave in 1995 also came from Nigeria and Albania, while in 1996\u20131998, even more migrants came from [[Moldova]], [[Lithuania]], and Albania.<ref name=\"carchedi\"/> Italian immigration laws became much more restrictive in 1998, with the enactment of the ''Legge Turco-Napolitano'' (40/98).<ref name=\"danna04\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbAUdBR2f5sC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=%22daniela+danna%22#v=onepage&q=%22daniela%20danna%22&f=false |author=Daniela Danna |location=Italy |title=The never-ending debate, in Outshoorn J (ed.) |website=The Politics of Prostitution Cambridge UP |year=2004 |pages=165\u2013184 |isbn=9780521540698 }}</ref><ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"danna\">[http://www.danieladanna.it/Street%20prostitution%20and%20public%20policies%20in%20Milan.pdf Daniela Danna.

These issues of foreign nationals, coerced prostitution, and under-aged prostitutes have re-shaped the prostitution debate in Italy, as elsewhere around Europe, in recent years. Descriptions of the conditions of migrant women, particularly young women, on the streets, shifted the debate in the 1990s from the ''Comitato'''s perception of prostitutes as independent and assertive women to that of victims of male violence.<ref name=\"carchedi\"/> One response of the local authorities in dealing with the problem was rescinding residence permits issued to foreign women found in the streets, and increased deportations of the ''clandestini''.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n=====Street prostitution=====\nWith migration, street prostitution became more visible, the prostitutes being considered to now be mainly foreigners. In turn, this created another force driving public attitudes, which were community groups from urban neighbourhoods where street prostitution was most visible, particularly since the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"danna\"/><ref>Leonini L.(ed) Sesso in acquisto.

In 1996, [[Livia Turco]], the Minister of Social Affairs, introduced the first \"Justice Permit\" for trafficking victims who renounced their traffickers, as part of the Prime Minister [[Lamberto Dini]]'s immigration decree. However, Catholic organizations opposed the denunciation clause. The political initiative to address the situation of women migrant workers came from [[Anna Finocchiaro]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]), the Minister of Equal Opportunities. [[Giorgio Napolitano]] ([[Democrats of the Left]]), the Interior Minister, announced new measures in 1997 to deal with prostitution as an issue of urban safety, and there was little debate over his proposals, given widespread concerns over human trafficking. The main opposing viewpoint was that residence permits should be granted only on the condition of victims denouncing traffickers.<ref>Finocchiaro A. Prefazione, in Carchedi 2000</ref>\nWhat debate there was, was essentially confined to the position of women. The resulting legislation was the ''Legge Turco-Napolitano'' of 1998 (40/98).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/98040l.htm |title=Legge 6 marzo 1998, n. 40. \"Disciplina dell'immigrazione e norme sulla condizione dello straniero.\" pubblicata nella Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 59 del 12 marzo 1998 \u2013 Supplemento Ordinario n. 40 |publisher=Camera.it }}</ref> The position of the relatively weak and scattered women's movement was that victims should not be further victimized by having them expelled to their home country, or by putting them in a possibly life-threatening situation.\n\nMeasures adopted by the law included increased penalties for recruiting and trafficking, and allowing victims of trafficking to stay in the country under a \"protection permit\". The law envisioned that these permits would be administered by local police chiefs (''questori'') on humanitarian grounds, but this concerned NGOs because of the complexity of the procedures involved and the potential for abuse. The law also required the victim to enroll in training courses organized and by approved NGOs. The law also allocated funds for associations assisting these victims, but did require them to exit sex work, although they were supposed to denounce it. The requirement for denuciation in the original Dini decree was removed. In advocating this, Turco was influenced by the Commission for Equal Opportunities, whose first president, [[Elena Marinucci]] ([[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|PSI]]), had embraced the aims of the Comitato and attempted to legislate this in 1987.\n\nAmongst critics were the ''Comitato'' who objected to prostitution as something that women required to be protected from, without addressing stigmatization. However, Catholic organizations dominated the list of approved agencies, and followed this belief. However, the debates did distinguish between forced prostitution and a \"free and conscious choice of the individual\".<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref>Fiorensoli MP. (ed.)

Confronto e riflessioni sulla prostituzione a partire da un punto di vista di donne'' (Proceedings of the Conference at Modena, 7 November 1998) Rome: Il pese delle donne, 1998.</ref>\n\n=====Effect=====\nAlthough the law was not explicitly targeted at sex work, its implementation was. Despite gender neutral language, the implementation focused on young female victims of trafficking, which was driven by populist media imagery. The new law did little to stem the debate. When the government led by [[Massimo D'Alema]] was elected later that year in October 1998 three women ministers from three political parties ([[Federation of the Greens]], [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]], and [[Democrats of the Left]]) - [[Laura Balbo]] (Equal Opportunities), [[Rosa Russo Jervolino]] (Internal Affairs) and Livia Turco (Social Affairs) announced they would look at new proposals on battling trafficking and defending the dignity of women.\n\nThe result was a new prominence for Anna Finocchiaro's consultative body, the Inter-ministerial Table for the Fight against Trafficking (in February 1998) with wide representation. Finocchiaro had declared \"Trafficking in women is a new and very serious problem that we have to combat primarily with the punishment for reduction into slavery, instead of using the Merlin law\". In March 1999, the ministers announced new, more severe, penalties for exploitation, and new rules for protecting those who renounced prostitution. Available statistics for 1998 reported 342 known victims, 37 percent of whom were minors, predominantly originating from Albania, Nigeria and [[FR Yugoslavia]]. A total of 242 permits were granted in 1999 and 600 in 2000.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n===''Legge Carfagna'' proposal===\nUntil 2008, although there were no laws against [[street prostitution]], other laws concerning public order and decency could be used to regulate it, and some places had local ordinances enacted against street prostitution.

It also provides for repatriation of foreign minors engaging in prostitution. Article 3 deals with organized crime, penalizing conspiracy to exploit prostitution via article 416 of the penal code.

Under these powers, sex workers and clients have been subjected to ordinances that permit municipal police to administer fines. The [[Public Security Law]] enables police chiefs to expel persons from a city in which they do not officially reside. EU citizens are subject to fines while non-EU citizens may be placed in detention centres and deported. The Comitato reports a breakdown in relationships between NGOs and authorities and between NGOs and workers, an avoidance of health services and an increase in criminal activity. While enforcement varies by region and over time, the immediate effect has been the expected and desired one of clearing the streets (at least temporarily) and displacing workers to remote areas. Indoors work has increased, and quality of life in general has deteriorated. Unprotected sex has increased due to reduced ability to negotiate. Stigmatization and vulnerability have increased, as has a greater reliance on social services. As noted in other countries, as soon as police activity is reduced, older work patterns reappear.<ref name=\"tamp09\"/>\nOn 7 April 2011, the Italian Constitutional Court with the Sentence n. 115/2011 decided that this kind of Mayors' Ordinances must have time and space limits and urgent conditions to be issued. So, the simple exercise of street prostitution could be no more persecuted by this kind of local bills.\n\n==Legal status==\n\nProstitution is legal (it is not mentioned in the Penal Code as such), brothels and pimping are illegal. Single sex workers working from apartments are \"tolerated\". Loitering is permitted, but soliciting (\"unabashedly inviting clients on the street\") is illegal. Migrants with work or residence permits may work in sex work, and police cannot revoke residence permits and begin deportation procedures, as they tried failing by the Italian laws.\n\nWork permits can be issued to migrant dancers in entertainment clubs for one year in a single workplace. Sex work is forbidden, but nude dancing is tolerated. Suspicions of sexual encounters lead to club closures.<ref name=\"tamp09\">{{cite web |url=http://tampep.eu/documents/Sexworkmigrationhealth_final.pdf |title=Sexwork&#124;Migration&#124;Health TAMPEP 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116062644/http://tampep.eu/documents/Sexworkmigrationhealth_final.pdf |archivedate=16 November 2013  }}</ref>\nBy a fiscal law in 2006 (art. 36 paragraph 34 bis of Law 248/2006), prostitution has got taxed on the same way for every legal money earned, as the Highest Court has declared many times. The last one of these Judgments has carried out in 2016 (n. 22413/2016) and sex workers must have their activity registered, paying taxes as all free professionists.\n\n===Case law===\nA 2010 court decision created a new precedent, that clients who did not pay the worker would be considered guilty of rape.<ref>[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/node/19233 Clients who don't pay prostitutes 'Guilty of Rape'] Life in Italy, 9 March 2010</ref>\nThis was considered a major breakthrough for prostitutes' rights.\n\n==Theoretical discourses==\nThe three main debates which have occupied the public, media, and policy makers are<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n* Allowing victims of trafficking to stay in the country (see [[#Dealing with immigration (Legge Turco-Napolitano L40/98)|Immigration]])\n* Criminalization of clients of prostituted children under 18 (see [[#Underage workers|Underage workers]])\n* Assisting sex workers, including victims of trafficking. (see [[#Assisting migrant sex workers|Assisting migrant sex workers]])\n\nAccording to a [[TAMPEP]] report on the legislations and policies regarding prostitution in Europe, in Italy, the dominant frames are sex work as violence, force, organized crime, a threat to public security and order, and driving demand for migration and trafficking.<ref name=\"tamp09\"/>\n\n===Actors===\nAmongst the political actors were the ''[[Centri antiviolenza]]'' (Anti-violence centres), and women's shelters who advocated for victims of trafficking to stay in the country even if they did not denounce their exploiters, in keeping with their vision that women are best empowered by allowing them to determine their own course of action.\n\nThe women's movement has been divided between those who saw prostitution as exploitation and those who saw it as work. In general,\nthe movement has not prioritized prostitution, giving it mid-level importance, and saw it as a cultural issue, and did not trust the State as an intervenor. On this issue, Catholic organizations have been part of a hostile backlash to feminism, as is the fascist right. For example, the mayor of Bologna cut all funding to women's shelters.\n\nThe women's movement denounced prostitution.<ref name=\"books.google.ca\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbAUdBR2f5sC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=%22daniela+danna%22#v=onepage&q=%22daniela%20danna%22&f=false |title=The Politics of Prostitution: Women's Movements, Democratic States and the \u2026 |isbn=9780521540698 |last1=Outshoorn |first1=Joyce |date=8 January 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe policy of fining clients of street prostitutes, which has started to be implemented in the early 1990s, by city mayors, has been approved by part of the feminist movement (blaming clients for the existence of prostitution is a common discourse among both feminists and Catholics),<ref name=\"books.google.ca\"/> but opposed by other women who felt this policy further victimized the women.\n\nAmongst the ongoing debates surrounding prostitution in Italy are the legal scholars who advocate \"[[diritto leggero]]\", the concept that the State should intervene only minimally in matters considered the free choice of the individual. There was a trend towards supporting normalization. A prominent advocate for this position has been [[Roberta Tatafiore]], chief editor of ''[[Noidonne]]'' (\"Us Women\").<ref>Tatafiore R. Sesso al lavoro. Il Saggiatore, Milan 1994</ref>\n\nIn regard to legal issues, feminists in general have supported the Merlin law, which banned brothels and regulation; and stood for decriminalization, with the exception of exploitation by third parties (pimps).\n\nIn the centre-left government of [[Romano Prodi|Prodi]], the policy system was reasonably open, and the dominant approach matched that of the women's movement, in moving ahead with \"protection\".<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n===Clients===\nThe shift in emphasis from workers to clients in 1994, when mayors ordered police to fine clients, was welcomed by Catholics and feminists. In Bologna in 1998, the ''Case delle donne per non-subire violenze'', the ''Comitato'', and MIT, a trans-sexual organization, left the city's co-ordinating committee on prostitution in protest, believing that any repression worsened workers' working conditions. There was also a feeling that criminalizing clients prevented them reporting abuse of workers or collaborating with authorities.\n\nThe issue was raised again in 1999 by [[Rosa Russo Iervolino|Jervolino]], proposing amending the Merlin Law to stiffen penalties for exploitation. [[Giuliano Amato]], Minister of Institutional Reforms, suggested that instead the client should be penalized, and [[Antonio Di Pietro]] ([[Lista Di Pietro]]) introduced a bill into the [[Italian Senate|Senate]], but raised the ire of politicians, in particular Livia Turco, who emphasised that prostitution should be decriminalized, and only \"true abuse\" be penalized. She and Laura Balbo also received representation from the ''Comitato'' against this. This debate occurred during meetings of a parliamentary commission into prostitution, where there were frequent references to under-age foreign prostitutes.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n====Underage workers (L. 269/98)====\nPartly connected to this was the emergence of a need to criminalize clients using under-age workers. Engaging in sexual activity with someone under 14 was already classified as statutory rape, but that still left many under-age workers. While the age of consent is 14, paying to engage in sexual activities with teenagers between 14 and 17 years old, regardless of consent, is a crime punished with imprisonment from one to six years. Publicity around underage workers has been a persistent concern in Italy as elsewhere, although in Italy it often appeared framed as homosexual molestation of male minors.\n\nIn 1996, two female politicians, [[Anna Serafini]] and [[Daria Bonfietti]] ([[Democrats of the Left|DS]]), introduced legislation to penalize the use of under-age workers, responding to a series of international forces, including Programme of Action Against Sexual Exploitation of Children for Commercial Purposes (Stockholm 1996), [[UNESCO]], and [[ECPAT]]. They received the support of [[Rosa Russo Iervolino|Rosa Russo Jervolino]], [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of Internal Affairs]]. This initiative unified a number of legislative proposals.\n\nThe media reported abuse and murders (particularly an 8-year-old boy in Ostia in 1998,)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/luglio/25/Ostia_Vincenzo_accusato_altro_figlio_co_0_9807252099.shtml |title=Ostia, Vincenzo accusato da un altro figlio. 25 July 1998 Corriere della Sera |website=Corriere della Sera }}</ref>\ninternet child pornography and sex tourism, with the terminology shifting from 'teenager' to 'child', and frequently conflated 'women and children' as equally vulnerable. Parliament responded rapidly and the Penal Code was amended<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/98269l.htm |title=Legge 3 agosto 1998, n. 269 \"Norme contro lo sfruttamento della prostituzione, della pornografia, del turismo sessuale in danno di minori, quali nuove forme di riduzione in schiavitu'.\" |website=Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 185 |date=10 August 1998 |publisher=Camera.it }}</ref>\nto deal with sexual contact with minors or possession of child pornography with no opposition.<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/luglio/29/legge_antipedofili_rischia_slittare__co_0_9807297526.shtml Martirano D. E la legge antipedofili rischia di slattere]. ''Corriere della Serra'', 29 July 1998</ref>\n\nThere was, however, division over the issue of the defence of ignorance, the final decision being it was not a defence. One feminist MP, [[Ersilia Salvato]] ([[Communist Refoundation Party|RC]]), complained about the rushed legislation, and abstained. Because Italian law prohibits gender discrimination (another legacy of [[Lina Merlin]]), the language was neutral, although not the effect. It was, however, considered impossible to enforce, since it would require the worker to lay the complaint. The issue was never on the agenda of the women's movement, not even by the shelters, and who played no part in the debate, nor did the Equal Opportunities Minister (Anna Finocchiaro). Nor was the policy environment receptive to feminist input, since the Government was anxious to be seen to be responding to media and moral panic on [[pedophilia]].<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n==Assisting migrant sex workers==\n{{See also|Migrant sex work}}\n\nIn 1998, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] ordered an \"Inquiry to increase knowledge about the social and sanitary aspects of prostitution\"<ref name=\"commission99\">Indagine conoscitiva sugli aspetti sociali e sanitari della prostituzione, Camera dei deputati, Commissione XII (affari sociali) 1999, pp. VIII-160, Euro 6,71 (IC13022)</ref> in response to concerns about foreign workers on the streets. Anna Finocchiaro, the Minister of Equal Opportunities, was a key player in this, as was the Justice Commission President Marida Bolognesi (DS). The Inquiry interviewed many stakeholders during six hearings, but there was relatively little representation from the women's movement. The main framework was the idea that foreigners were \"invading\" the streets of Italy, as a public order issue. This was a heavily gendered debate. In the end, the commission adopted three principles&nbsp;\u2013 harm reduction, education of clients, and the importance of upholding the Merlin law. The deliberations included proposing a law to finance local government programmes to assist sex workers with protection permits. At the same time, the three women ministers were promoting education campaigns in the countries of origin of migrant sex workers (e. g., Nigeria, Eastern Europe), while other programmes assisted police in their responsibilities regarding permits were initiated, and help lines set up, while 8 million euros were allocated to NGOs to carry out their responsibilities under article 18 of the Turco-Napolitano Act.\n\nThere was little feminist input into this discussion, with the exception of [[Elsa Antonioni]] of the Anti-violence shelter, who stressed the continuity between sex for money and sex for free, pointing to the vulnerability of sex workers' civil rights (e. g., their children could be taken into care). This was not pursued, although the strong role of the Equal Opportunities Ministry can be seen as an insider women's voice.<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"commission99\"/>\n\n==Advocacy==\nAn influential group of sex workers is the ''Comitato'' \u2013 Committee for the Civil Rights of Prostitutes (Comitato per i Diritti Civili delle Prostitute, or CDCP), formed in 1983 in response to violent attacks on sex workers and run by [[Carla Corso]] and [[Pia Covre]] from their national offices in Pordenone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lucciole.org/content/view/18/9/ |title=Committee for the Civil Rights of Prostitutes |publisher=Lucciole.org }}</ref>\nTheir campaigns include trafficking prevention, sex worker rights, and campaigning for decriminalization and an end to stigmatization. Their demands saw a number of bills introduced in parliament, which, despite support from three leftist parties, were unsuccessful. However, attempts to change the law continue in parliament. The Comitato has been one of the major women's voices in sex work debates in Italy, at least in comparison with the women's movement overall, and worked closely with the women's shelters. Their position of minimum interference was shared with both the women's movement and the policy agencies. This has only been partially successful. A frequent target has been the provisions of the Merlin Law that punish those involved, of which Livia Turco was a prominent political voice. Positioned against this cause has been the law-and-order agenda of both centre-left and centre-right coalitions.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:10.3010 Torino-nightlife.v2.jpg|thumb|Prostitute talking to a potential customer in [[Turin]]]]\n\nAccurate estimates of the numbers of workers in any particular country are hard to obtain, and prone to error and bias.\n\nA 2008 report stated that were some 100,000 prostitutes in Italy.<ref name=\"itmag091008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/crime/government-set-approve-anti-prostitution-bill |title=Government set to approve anti-prostitution bill |website=Italy Magazine |date=10 September 2008}}</ref>\nIn 2007 it was stated that the total number of workers was 70,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=in: Hot Issues |url=http://www.impactlab.com/2007/01/26/70000-prostitutes-in-italy |title=70,000 Prostitutes in Italy |publisher=Impact Lab |date=26 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stranitalia.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=148&Itemid=1 |title=Italy preparing to punish prostitutes and their clients |publisher=Stranitalia.com |date=13 September 2008}}</ref>\nThe Italian Statistics Institute stated the number of street workers in 1998 was 50,000.<ref name=\"dantuono\">{{cite journal|author1=A D'Antuono |author2=F Andal\u00f2 |author3=E M Carl\u00e0 |author4=S De Tommaso |url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/77/3/220.full |title=Prevalence of STDs and HIV infection among immigrant sex workers attending an STD centre in Bologna, Italy.

Brothels were banned in 1958. A [[euphemism]] often used to refer to street prostitutes in Italy is ''Lucciole'' (lit. \"[[fireflies]]\"), while escorts are referred to as ''Squillo'' ([[onomatopoeia]] referring to the sound of a ringing telephone, making it analogous to \"[[call girl]]\").\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prostitute from Treviso, Italy.jpg|200px|thumb|Prostitute in a brothel of [[Treviso]]]]\nProstitution thrived in Italy in the [[Middle Ages]]. The city of [[Venice]] declared in 1358 that brothels were indispensable, and [[courtesans]] achieved high social status in Venice, particularly in the 17th century.<ref>''Leggi e Memorie Venete sulla Prostituzione''. Lorenji, Venice 1872</ref>\n\n===''Regolamentazione''===\nThe ''Regolamentazione'', or the ''regulation system of prostitution'', was established in 1861, with [[Italian unification]], modeled on the French Napoleonic system of ''[[Prostitution in France#Regulation|R\u00e9glementation]]'' and the Bureau des Moeurs (a government office tasked with regulating vice, which included officially registering prostitutes). An 1859 decree, by [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]] to aid the French army which supported the [[Piedmontese]] in their fight against Austria, authorized the opening of houses controlled by the state for the exercise of prostitution in [[Lombardy]]. On 15 February 1860, the decree was signed into law (referred to as ''Legge Cavour'') with the enactment of the \"Regulations of the Security Service on Prostitution\".\n\nA further law (''Legge Crispi''), adopted on 29 March 1888, prohibited the selling of food and drinks, and parties, dances, and songs in brothels, and banned such establishments near places of worship, schools, and kindergartens. It also provided that the shutters should always remain closed, which is the origin of the Italian expression \"closed houses\" (''case chiuse''). A further amendment was the ''Legge Nicotera'' of 1891. Under this system, prostitution in Italy was fully legal in private houses. A system of ''sifilicomi'' (hospitals for sex workers) was also set up, under the belief that they were the main sources of spreading [[venereal diseases]]. [[File:Interior of a brothel in Naples, Italy 1945 (2) - Prostitutes.jpg|300px|thumb|Prostitutes waiting for customers in a brothel of [[Naples]]]] Although prostitutes found this regulated system oppressive, they developed ways to resist it. During the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist rule]] (1922\u20131943), more restrictive measures were gradually introduced in 1923, 1933, and 1940.\nOverall, the system was considered a failure, and as in other European countries with ''R\u00e9glementation'', movement for its abolition started to grow from the late 19th century, supported by leftist and feminist groups. This ''abolitionism'' of the time is often considered confusing, since it has been applied to both the abolition of regulations restricting prostitution and the abolition of prostitution itself. However, these forces led to the introduction of a new system in Italy that abolished regulation, but not prostitution as such.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=prostitution+italy#PPA441,M1 |title=Mary Gibson: Prostitution and the State in Italy, 1860\u20131915 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location= New Jersey |year=1986 |isbn=9781563081316 }}</ref>\n\n===''Legge Merlin'' (1958)===\nThe ''Legge Merlin'' (L75/1958)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pariopportunita.gov.it/images/stories/documenti_vari/UserFiles/L_20-2-1958_n75.pdf |title=Legge 75/58 20 February 1958 \"Abolizione della regolamentazione della prostituzione e lotta contro lo sfruttamento della prostituzione altrui\" (detta \"Legge Merlin\") |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120061105/http://www.pariopportunita.gov.it/images/stories/documenti_vari/UserFiles/L_20-2-1958_n75.pdf |archivedate=20 January 2016  }}</ref>\n(the Merlin Law, named after its main author, the [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] member of parliament [[Lina Merlin]]), came into power on 20 September 1958. This law, still in force today with very little changes, revoked the regulation system, banned brothels, and established a new criminal offence called \"exploitation of prostitution\" (''sfruttamento della prostituzione'') with the aim to punish [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring of sexual services]]. Specifically, article 3.8 provides penalties for \"any person who in any way promotes or exploits the prostitution of others\" (''chiunque in qualsiasi modo favorisca o sfrutti la prostituzione altrui''). Article 3.3 lists a number of public places where prostitution is prohibited, such as houses, hotels, dance halls, and entertainment clubs. Article 5 prohibits solicitation (''libertinaggio'') \"in a public place, or place open to the public, or soliciting in a scandolous or disturbing manner, or follows a person and invites them by acts or words\".<ref>{{lang|it|\n1) che in luogo pubblico od aperto al pubblico, invitano al\nlibertinaggio in modo scandaloso o molesto;\n2) che seguono per via le persone, invitandole con atti o parole al\nlibertinaggio}}</ref>\nArticle 7 prohibited registration and mandatory health checks for prostitutes.<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"tamp09\"/><ref>3.3 chiunque, essendo proprietario, gerente o preposto a un\nalbergo, casa mobiliata, pensione, spaccio di bevande, circolo, locale da\nballo, o luogo di spettacolo, o loro annessi e dipendenze o qualunque\nlocale aperto al pubblico od utilizzato dal pubblico, vi tollera\nabitualmente la presenza di una o pi\u00f9 persone che, all'interno del locale\nstesso, si d\u00e0nno alla prostituzione (hotel, mobile home, retirement, canteen, club, meeting rooms\ndance, or place of entertainment)</ref>\n\n====Theory====\nThe Merlin Law follows the standard abolitionist (abolishing regulation) view of prostitution control policy, prohibiting trafficking, exploitation, and aiding and abetting of prostitution. What remained legal was [[street prostitution]], or independent prostitution done by a prostitute in their own home. The law was promoted as an equality measure liberating women, but despite its good intentions to give more rights to prostitutes otherwise dependent on pimps, it was and still remains to this day a subject of intense debate. Among other controversial points, the text of the law specifically refers to women (''donne'').<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"tamp09\"/>\n\n====Result====\nThe effect of the law was to push women out into the [[street prostitution|streets]], which made them more visible, and into private homes.<ref name=\"carchedi\">{{cite web|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/papers/02102862n60p85.pdf |title=Francesco Carchedi: Considerations on foreign prostitution in Italy.

The [[Christian Democracy (Italy, 1997)|Christian Democrats]] repeatedly sought the repeal of the law since 1973, and they were joined in 1998 by the [[Democrats of the Left]]. Repeal of the law would have re-opened brothels. At the same time, conservative women's groups such as [[Federcasalinghe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donne.it/ |title=Federcasalinghe |publisher=Donne.it |date=21 June 2013}}</ref>\npushed for more regulation, including as health checks, but these propositions were generally opposed by feminists.

The dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and new immigration policies (such as ''Legge Martelli'' of 1990) contributed to a rapid influx of sex workers in 1989-1990 originating from former [[Soviet bloc]] countries, giving rise to the colloquial term \"Polish Girls\" (''ragazze polacche''). A second wave of immigrant sex workers from [[Nigeria]] and [[Peru]], arriving to Italy using [[tourist visas]] and staying in the country after they had expired (the so-called ''clandestini'') ensued, followed by a third wave from [[Albania]] in 1993-1994. The fourth wave in 1995 also came from Nigeria and Albania, while in 1996-1998, even more migrants came from [[Moldova]], [[Lithuania]], and Albania.<ref name=\"carchedi\"/> Italian immigration laws became much more restrictive in 1998, with the enactment of the ''Legge Turco-Napolitano'' (40/98).<ref name=\"danna04\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbAUdBR2f5sC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=%22daniela+danna%22#v=onepage&q=%22daniela%20danna%22&f=false |author=Daniela Danna |location=Italy |title=The never-ending debate, in Outshoorn J (ed.) |website=The Politics of Prostitution Cambridge UP |year=2004 |pages=165\u2013184 |isbn=9780521540698 }}</ref><ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"danna\">[http://www.danieladanna.it/Street%20prostitution%20and%20public%20policies%20in%20Milan.pdf Daniela Danna.

These issues of foreign nationals, coerced prostitution, and under-aged prostitutes have re-shaped the prostitution debate in Italy, as elsewhere around Europe, in recent years. Descriptions of the conditions of migrant women, particularly young women, on the streets, shifted the debate in the 1990s from the ''Comitato'''s perception of prostitutes as independent and assertive women to that of victims of male violence.<ref name=\"carchedi\"/> One response of the local authorities in dealing with the problem was rescinding residence permits issued to foreign women found in the streets, and increased deportations of the ''clandestini''.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n=====Street prostitution=====\nWith migration, street prostitution became more visible, the prostitutes being considered to now be mainly foreigners. In turn, this created another force driving public attitudes, which were community groups from urban neighbourhoods where street prostitution was most visible, particularly since the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"danna\"/><ref>Leonini L.(ed) Sesso in acquisto.

In 1996, [[Livia Turco]], the Minister of Social Affairs, introduced the first \"Justice Permit\" for trafficking victims who renounced their traffickers, as part of the Prime Minister [[Lamberto Dini]]'s immigration decree. However, Catholic organizations opposed the denunciation clause. The political initiative to address the situation of women migrant workers came from [[Anna Finocchiaro]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]), the Minister of Equal Opportunities. [[Giorgio Napolitano]] ([[Democrats of the Left]]), the Interior Minister, announced new measures in 1997 to deal with prostitution as an issue of urban safety, and there was little debate over his proposals, given widespread concerns over human trafficking. The main opposing viewpoint was that residence permits should be granted only on the condition of victims denouncing traffickers.<ref>Finocchiaro A. Prefazione, in Carchedi 2000</ref>\nWhat debate there was, was essentially confined to the position of women. The resulting legislation was the ''Legge Turco-Napolitano'' of 1998 (40/98).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/98040l.htm |title=Legge 6 marzo 1998, n. 40. \"Disciplina dell'immigrazione e norme sulla condizione dello straniero.\" pubblicata nella Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 59 del 12 marzo 1998 \u2013 Supplemento Ordinario n. 40 |publisher=Camera.it }}</ref> The position of the relatively weak and scattered women's movement was that victims should not be further victimized by having them expelled to their home country, or by putting them in a possibly life-threatening situation.\n\nMeasures adopted by the law included increased penalties for recruiting and trafficking, and allowing victims of trafficking to stay in the country under a \"protection permit\". The law envisioned that these permits would be administered by local police chiefs (''questori'') on humanitarian grounds, but this concerned NGOs because of the complexity of the procedures involved and the potential for abuse. The law also required the victim to enroll in training courses organized and by approved NGOs. The law also allocated funds for associations assisting these victims, but did require them to exit sex work, although they were supposed to denounce it. The requirement for denuciation in the original Dini decree was removed. In advocating this, Turco was influenced by the Commission for Equal Opportunities, whose first president, [[Elena Marinucci]] ([[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|PSI]]), had embraced the aims of the Comitato and attempted to legislate this in 1987.\n\nAmongst critics were the ''Comitato'' who objected to prostitution as something that women required to be protected from, without addressing stigmatization. However, Catholic organizations dominated the list of approved agencies, and followed this belief. However, the debates did distinguish between forced prostitution and a \"free and conscious choice of the individual\".<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref>Fiorensoli MP. (ed.)

Confronto e riflessioni sulla prostituzione a partire da un punto di vista di donne'' (Proceedings of the Conference at Modena, 7 November 1998) Rome: Il pese delle donne, 1998.</ref>\n\n=====Effect=====\nAlthough the law was not explicitly targeted at sex work, its implementation was. Despite gender neutral language, the implementation focused on young female victims of trafficking, which was driven by populist media imagery. The new law did little to stem the debate. When the government led by [[Massimo D'Alema]] was elected later that year in October 1998 three women ministers from three political parties ([[Federation of the Greens]], [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]], and [[Democrats of the Left]]) - [[Laura Balbo]] (Equal Opportunities), [[Rosa Russo Jervolino]] (Internal Affairs) and Livia Turco (Social Affairs) announced they would look at new proposals on battling trafficking and defending the dignity of women.\n\nThe result was a new prominence for Anna Finocchiaro's consultative body, the Inter-ministerial Table for the Fight against Trafficking (in February 1998) with wide representation. Finocchiaro had declared \"Trafficking in women is a new and very serious problem that we have to combat primarily with the punishment for reduction into slavery, instead of using the Merlin law\". In March 1999, the ministers announced new, more severe, penalties for exploitation, and new rules for protecting those who renounced prostitution. Available statistics for 1998 reported 342 known victims, 37 percent of whom were minors, predominantly originating from Albania, Nigeria and [[FR Yugoslavia]]. A total of 242 permits were granted in 1999 and 600 in 2000.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n===''Legge Carfagna'' proposal===\nUntil 2008, although there were no laws against [[street prostitution]], other laws concerning public order and decency could be used to regulate it, and some places had local ordinances enacted against street prostitution.

Under these powers, sex workers and clients have been subjected to ordinances that permit municipal police to administer fines. The [[Public Security Law]] enables police chiefs to expel persons from a city in which they do not officially reside. EU citizens are subject to fines while non-EU citizens may be placed in detention centres and deported. The Comitato reports a breakdown in relationships between NGOs and authorities and between NGOs and workers, an avoidance of health services and an increase in criminal activity. While enforcement varies by region and over time, the immediate effect has been the expected and desired one of clearing the streets (at least temporarily) and displacing workers to remote areas. Indoors work has increased, and quality of life in general has deteriorated. Unprotected sex has increased due to reduced ability to negotiate. Stigmatization and vulnerability have increased, as has a greater reliance on social services. As noted in other countries, as soon as police activity is reduced, older work patterns reappear.<ref name=\"tamp09\"/>\nOn 7 April 2011, the Italian Constitutional Court with the Sentence n. 115/2011 decided that this kind of Mayors' Ordinances must have time and space limits and urgent conditions to be issued. So, the simple exercise of street prostitution could be no more persecuted by this kind of local bills.\n\n==Legal status==\n\nProstitution is legal (it is not mentioned in the Penal Code as such), brothels and pimping are illegal. Single sex workers working from apartments are \"tolerated\". Loitering is permitted, but soliciting (\"unabashedly inviting clients on the street\") is illegal. Migrants with work or residence permits may work in sex work, and police cannot revoke residence permits and begin deportation procedures, as they tried failing by the Italian laws.\n\nWork permits can be issued to migrant dancers in entertainment clubs for one year in a single workplace. Sex work is forbidden, but nude dancing is tolerated. Suspicions of sexual encounters lead to club closures.<ref name=\"tamp09\">{{cite web |url=http://tampep.eu/documents/Sexworkmigrationhealth_final.pdf |title=Sexwork&#124;Migration&#124;Health TAMPEP 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116062644/http://tampep.eu/documents/Sexworkmigrationhealth_final.pdf |archivedate=16 November 2013  }}</ref>\nBy a fiscal law in 2006 (art. 36 paragraph 34 bis of Law 248/2006), prostitution has got taxed on the same way for every legal money earned, as the Highest Court has declared many times. The last one of these Judgments has carried out in 2016 (n. 22413/2016) and sex workers must have their activity registered, paying taxes as all free professionists.\n\n===Case law===\nA 2010 court decision created a new precedent, that clients who did not pay the worker would be considered guilty of rape.<ref>[http://www.lifeinitaly.com/node/19233 Clients who don't pay prostitutes 'Guilty of Rape'] Life in Italy, 9 March 2010</ref>\nThis was considered a major breakthrough for prostitutes' rights.\n\n==Theoretical discourses==\nThe three main debates which have occupied the public, media, and policy makers are<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n* Allowing victims of trafficking to stay in the country (see [[#Dealing with immigration (Legge Turco-Napolitano L40/98)|Immigration]])\n* Criminalization of clients of prostituted children under 18 (see [[#Underage workers|Underage workers]])\n* Assisting sex workers, including victims of trafficking. (see [[#Assisting migrant sex workers|Assisting migrant sex workers]])\n\nAccording to a [[TAMPEP]] report on the legislations and policies regarding prostitution in Europe, in Italy, the dominant frames are sex work as violence, force, organized crime, a threat to public security and order, and driving demand for migration and trafficking.<ref name=\"tamp09\"/>\n\n===Actors===\nAmongst the political actors were the ''[[Centri antiviolenza]]'' (Anti-violence centres), and women's shelters who advocated for victims of trafficking to stay in the country even if they did not denounce their exploiters, in keeping with their vision that women are best empowered by allowing them to determine their own course of action.\n\nThe women's movement has been divided between those who saw prostitution as exploitation and those who saw it as work. In general,\nthe movement has not prioritized prostitution, giving it mid-level importance, and saw it as a cultural issue, and did not trust the State as an intervenor. On this issue, Catholic organizations have been part of a hostile backlash to feminism, as is the fascist right. For example, the mayor of Bologna cut all funding to women's shelters.\n\nThe women's movement denounced prostitution.<ref name=\"books.google.ca\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbAUdBR2f5sC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=%22daniela+danna%22#v=onepage&q=%22daniela%20danna%22&f=false |title=The Politics of Prostitution: Women's Movements, Democratic States and the \u2026 |isbn=9780521540698 |last1=Outshoorn |first1=Joyce |date=8 January 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe policy of fining clients of street prostitutes, which has started to be implemented in the early 1990s, by city mayors, has been approved by part of the feminist movement (blaming clients for the existence of prostitution is a common discourse among both feminists and Catholics),<ref name=\"books.google.ca\"/> but opposed by other women who felt this policy further victimized the women.\n\nAmongst the ongoing debates surrounding prostitution in Italy are the legal scholars who advocate \"[[diritto leggero]]\", the concept that the State should intervene only minimally in matters considered the free choice of the individual. There was a trend towards supporting normalization. A prominent advocate for this position has been [[Roberta Tatafiore]], chief editor of ''[[Noidonne]]'' (\"Us Women\").<ref>Tatafiore R. Sesso al lavoro. Il Saggiatore, Milan 1994</ref>\n\nIn regard to legal issues, feminists in general have supported the Merlin law, which banned brothels and regulation; and stood for decriminalization, with the exception of exploitation by third parties (pimps).\n\nIn the centre-left government of [[Romano Prodi|Prodi]], the policy system was reasonably open, and the dominant approach matched that of the women's movement, in moving ahead with \"protection\".<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n===Clients===\nThe shift in emphasis from workers to clients in 1994, when mayors ordered police to fine clients, was welcomed by Catholics and feminists. In Bologna in 1998, the ''Case delle donne per non-subire violenze'', the ''Comitato'', and MIT, a trans-sexual organization, left the city's co-ordinating committee on prostitution in protest, believing that any repression worsened workers' working conditions. There was also a feeling that criminalizing clients prevented them reporting abuse of workers or collaborating with authorities.\n\nThe issue was raised again in 1999 by [[Rosa Russo Iervolino|Jervolino]], proposing amending the Merlin Law to stiffen penalties for exploitation. [[Giuliano Amato]], Minister of Institutional Reforms, suggested that instead the client should be penalized, and [[Antonio Di Pietro]] ([[Lista Di Pietro]]) introduced a bill into the [[Italian Senate|Senate]], but raised the ire of politicians, in particular Livia Turco, who emphasised that prostitution should be decriminalized, and only \"true abuse\" be penalized. She and Laura Balbo also received representation from the ''Comitato'' against this. This debate occurred during meetings of a parliamentary commission into prostitution, where there were frequent references to under-age foreign prostitutes.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n====Underage workers (L. 269/98)====\nPartly connected to this was the emergence of a need to criminalize clients using under-age workers. Engaging in sexual activity with someone under 14 was already classified as statutory rape, but that still left many under-age workers. While the age of consent is 14, paying to engage in sexual activities with teenagers between 14 and 17 years old, regardless of consent, is a crime punished with imprisonment from one to six years. Publicity around underage workers has been a persistent concern in Italy as elsewhere, although in Italy it often appeared framed as homosexual molestation of male minors.\n\nIn 1996, two female politicians, [[Anna Serafini]] and [[Daria Bonfietti]] ([[Democrats of the Left|DS]]), introduced legislation to penalize the use of under-age workers, responding to a series of international forces, including Programme of Action Against Sexual Exploitation of Children for Commercial Purposes (Stockholm 1996), [[UNESCO]], and [[ECPAT]]. They received the support of [[Rosa Russo Iervolino|Rosa Russo Jervolino]], [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of Internal Affairs]]. This initiative unified a number of legislative proposals.\n\nThe media reported abuse and murders (particularly an 8-year-old boy in Ostia in 1998,)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/luglio/25/Ostia_Vincenzo_accusato_altro_figlio_co_0_9807252099.shtml |title=Ostia, Vincenzo accusato da un altro figlio. 25 July 1998 Corriere della Sera |website=Corriere della Sera }}</ref>\ninternet child pornography and sex tourism, with the terminology shifting from 'teenager' to 'child', and frequently conflated 'women and children' as equally vulnerable. Parliament responded rapidly and the Penal Code was amended<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/98269l.htm |title=Legge 3 agosto 1998, n. 269 \"Norme contro lo sfruttamento della prostituzione, della pornografia, del turismo sessuale in danno di minori, quali nuove forme di riduzione in schiavitu'.\" |website=Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 185 |date=10 August 1998 |publisher=Camera.it }}</ref>\nto deal with sexual contact with minors or possession of child pornography with no opposition.<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/luglio/29/legge_antipedofili_rischia_slittare__co_0_9807297526.shtml Martirano D. E la legge antipedofili rischia di slattere]. ''Corriere della Serra'', 29 July 1998</ref>\n\nThere was, however, division over the issue of the defence of ignorance, the final decision being it was not a defence. One feminist MP, [[Ersilia Salvato]] ([[Communist Refoundation Party|RC]]), complained about the rushed legislation, and abstained. Because Italian law prohibits gender discrimination (another legacy of [[Lina Merlin]]), the language was neutral, although not the effect. It was, however, considered impossible to enforce, since it would require the worker to lay the complaint. The issue was never on the agenda of the women's movement, not even by the shelters, and who played no part in the debate, nor did the Equal Opportunities Minister (Anna Finocchiaro). Nor was the policy environment receptive to feminist input, since the Government was anxious to be seen to be responding to media and moral panic on [[pedophilia]].<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n==Assisting migrant sex workers==\n{{See also|Migrant sex work}}\n\nIn 1998, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] ordered an \"Inquiry to increase knowledge about the social and sanitary aspects of prostitution\"<ref name=\"commission99\">Indagine conoscitiva sugli aspetti sociali e sanitari della prostituzione, Camera dei deputati, Commissione XII (affari sociali) 1999, pp. VIII-160, Euro 6,71 (IC13022)</ref> in response to concerns about foreign workers on the streets. Anna Finocchiaro, the Minister of Equal Opportunities, was a key player in this, as was the Justice Commission President Marida Bolognesi (DS). The Inquiry interviewed many stakeholders during six hearings, but there was relatively little representation from the women's movement. The main framework was the idea that foreigners were \"invading\" the streets of Italy, as a public order issue. This was a heavily gendered debate. In the end, the commission adopted three principles&nbsp;\u2013 harm reduction, education of clients, and the importance of upholding the Merlin law. The deliberations included proposing a law to finance local government programmes to assist sex workers with protection permits. At the same time, the three women ministers were promoting education campaigns in the countries of origin of migrant sex workers (e. g., Nigeria, Eastern Europe), while other programmes assisted police in their responsibilities regarding permits were initiated, and help lines set up, while 8 million euros were allocated to NGOs to carry out their responsibilities under article 18 of the Turco-Napolitano Act.\n\nThere was little feminist input into this discussion, with the exception of [[Elsa Antonioni]] of the Anti-violence shelter, who stressed the continuity between sex for money and sex for free, pointing to the vulnerability of sex workers' civil rights (e. g., their children could be taken into care). This was not pursued, although the strong role of the Equal Opportunities Ministry can be seen as an insider women's voice.<ref name=\"danna04\"/><ref name=\"commission99\"/>\n\n==Advocacy==\nAn influential group of sex workers is the ''Comitato'' \u2013 Committee for the Civil Rights of Prostitutes (Comitato per i Diritti Civili delle Prostitute, or CDCP), formed in 1983 in response to violent attacks on sex workers and run by [[Carla Corso]] and [[Pia Covre]] from their national offices in Pordenone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lucciole.org/content/view/18/9/ |title=Committee for the Civil Rights of Prostitutes |publisher=Lucciole.org }}</ref>\nTheir campaigns include trafficking prevention, sex worker rights, and campaigning for decriminalization and an end to stigmatization. Their demands saw a number of bills introduced in parliament, which, despite support from three leftist parties, were unsuccessful. However, attempts to change the law continue in parliament. The Comitato has been one of the major women's voices in sex work debates in Italy, at least in comparison with the women's movement overall, and worked closely with the women's shelters. Their position of minimum interference was shared with both the women's movement and the policy agencies. This has only been partially successful. A frequent target has been the provisions of the Merlin Law that punish those involved, of which Livia Turco was a prominent political voice. Positioned against this cause has been the law-and-order agenda of both centre-left and centre-right coalitions.<ref name=\"danna04\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:10.3010 Torino-nightlife.v2.jpg|thumb|Prostitute talking to a potential customer in [[Turin]]]]\n\nAccurate estimates of the numbers of workers in any particular country are hard to obtain, and prone to error and bias.\n\nA 2008 report stated that were some 100,000 prostitutes in Italy.<ref name=\"itmag091008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy/crime/government-set-approve-anti-prostitution-bill |title=Government set to approve anti-prostitution bill |website=Italy Magazine |date=10 September 2008}}</ref>\nIn 2007 it was stated that the total number of workers was 70,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=in: Hot Issues |url=http://www.impactlab.com/2007/01/26/70000-prostitutes-in-italy |title=70,000 Prostitutes in Italy |publisher=Impact Lab |date=26 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stranitalia.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=148&Itemid=1 |title=Italy preparing to punish prostitutes and their clients |publisher=Stranitalia.com |date=13 September 2008}}</ref>\nThe Italian Statistics Institute stated the number of street workers in 1998 was 50,000.<ref name=\"dantuono\">{{cite journal|author1=A D'Antuono |author2=F Andal\u00f2 |author3=E M Carl\u00e0 |author4=S De Tommaso |url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/77/3/220.full |title=Prevalence of STDs and HIV infection among immigrant sex workers attending an STD centre in Bologna, Italy.

in [[Kilmarnock]], near [[Glasgow]].<ref name = BBC/> Laura started her career in sex work at the age of 19 in a massage parlour. After moving to Scotland, she became an independent escort and frequently visited [[Dublin]] and [[Belfast]] for work and to campaign. She had a degree in law from Portobello College in Dublin and at the time of her death, was in her third year of studying towards a degree in psychology. When Laura moved to Scotland, she settled in [[Oban]] and worked in a well paid position in the bank while simultaneously working in the sex industry. She stayed in Oban for six years before she was ran out of the town as the locals weren\u2019t fond of her second profession. After losing her job in banking in Oban, she then moved to Kilmarnock and spent the rest of her life there with her cats and her daughter. Her daughter was in full support of her mother\u2019s work.

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: \"I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain\".<ref>Eckstein and Sykes, p 8</ref> He named his fragrance ''Eau de Cologne'', in honour of his new hometown.<ref name=\"Fischer\">Fischer</ref>\n\nThe ''Original Eau de Cologne [[4711]]'', is named after its location at Glockengasse No. 4711. It was also developed in the 18th century by [[Wilhelm M\u00fclhens]] and produced in Cologne since at least 1799 and is therefore probably one of the oldest still produced fragrances in the world. On 12 December 2006, the perfumes and cosmetics company [[M\u00e4urer & Wirtz]] took over 4711 from [[Procter & Gamble]] and has expanded it to a whole brand since then.\n\nThe ''Eau de Cologne'' composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to \"nearly all royal houses in Europe\".<ref>Farina [[Fragrance Museum]] information leaflet</ref> His ability to produce a constantly homogeneous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time.

His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the world's oldest fragrance factory.\n\nIn 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a grand-grand-nephew of Giovanni Maria Farina, opened a perfumery business in [[Paris]] that was later sold to [[Roger & Gallet]]. That company now owns the rights to ''Eau de Cologne extra vieille'' in contrast to the ''Original Eau de Cologne'' from [[Cologne]].

In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: \"I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain\".<ref>Eckstein and Sykes, p 8</ref> He named his fragrance ''Eau de Cologne'', in honour of his new hometown.<ref name=\"Fischer\">Fischer</ref>\n\nThe ''Original Eau de Cologne [[4711]]'', is named after its location at Glockengasse No. 4711. It was also developed in the 18th century by [[Wilhelm M\u00fclhens]] and produced in Cologne since at least 1799 and is therefore probably one of the oldest still produced fragrances in the world. On 12 December 2006, the perfumes and cosmetics company [[M\u00e4urer & Wirtz]] took over 4711 from [[Procter & Gamble]] and has expanded it to a whole brand since then.\n\nThe ''Eau de Cologne'' composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to \"nearly all royal houses in Europe\".<ref>Farina [[Fragrance Museum]] information leaflet</ref> His ability to produce a constantly homogeneous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. A single vial of this ''aqua mirabilis'' ([[Latin]] for miracle water) cost half the annual salary of a civil servant.<ref name=\"Fischer\"/> When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of ''Eau de Cologne'' prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of ''Eau de Cologne''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bestmenscologne2020.com/|title=Top 10 Best Men's Cologne 2020 - Best Reviews Buying Guide|website=Best Men's Cologne 2020|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> Giovanni Maria Farina's formula has been produced in [[Cologne]] since 1709 by [[Johann Maria Farina gegen\u00fcber dem J\u00fclichs-Platz|Farina opposite the J\u00fclichplatz]]<ref name=\"Fischer\"/> and to this day remains a secret. His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the world's oldest fragrance factory.\n\nIn 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a grand-grand-nephew of Giovanni Maria Farina, opened a perfumery business in [[Paris]] that was later sold to [[Roger & Gallet]]. That company now owns the rights to ''Eau de Cologne extra vieille'' in contrast to the ''Original Eau de Cologne'' from [[Cologne]]. Originally the water of Cologne was believed to have the power to ward off bubonic plague.<ref>Monk, Paul M. S. ''Physical Chemistry: Understanding Our Chemical World''. 2004. Wiley.</ref> By drinking the cologne the citrus oil scent would be exuded through the pores, repelling fleas. Much as flea shampoo for dogs can be based on citrus oils today.\n\nIn modern times, ''Eau de Cologne'' or \"cologne\", has become a generic term. The term \"cologne\" can be applied to perfume for men or women, but it conventionally refers to perfumes marketed toward men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.germanywanderer.com/the-history-behind-eau-de-cologne/|title=The history behind eau de cologne|publisher=Germany Wanderer|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[4711]]\n* [[Aftershave]]\n* [[Deodorant]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal |first=Giovanni |last=Fenaroli |first2= L. |last2=Maggesi |title=Acqua di Colonia |journal=Rivista italiana essenze, profumi, piante offizinali, olii vegetali, saponi |volume= 42 |year=1960 |language=Italian}}\n* {{cite book|first=Francesco |last=La Face |chapter=Le materie prime per l'acqua di colonia |title=Relazione al Congresso di Sta.

All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women.\"\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nPotocka was born in 1760 January 1 (January 11, New Style) in the Turkish city of [[Bursa]] to Constantine Clavone, a poor Greek cattle merchant, and Maria Clavone. In 1772, when Zofia was 12 years old, she moved to the Greek district of [[Phanar]] in [[Constantinople]] with her parents and sisters. \n\nAround 1775, when Zofia was 15 years old, her father Constantine died under mysterious circumstances. Her mother married an Armenian, who also died. During the great fire in Constantinople, their house burned down. In this difficult time for them, her mother Maria sought support from foreign embassies. \n\nIn May 1777, when Zofia was not yet 17 years old, Maria sold her two daughters to the Polish Ambassador, [[Karol Boscamp-Lasopolski]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The ambassador was known to procure girls for the Polish king.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Learning about their supposed noble origin and seeing the beauty of the girls, the Ambassador agreed to help.

Reportedly, the ambassador kept her as his mistress for a time, and then prostituted her.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Boscamp-Lasopolski arranged for her sister to be sold as a wife to a Turkish Pasha,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> but he promised her mother to arrange marriage for Zofia in Europe. \n\nThe Polish Count Major [[J\u00f3zef Witt]] learned the purpose of the trip and her ancient lineage. He made an offer, bought her from Boscamp-Lasopolski and married her in 1779.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> \nJ\u00f3zef Witt was the son of the commandant of the fortress Kamianets, and the couple lived a year in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], before departing for Europe in 1781.\n\n===Europe===\nZofia reportedly made a sensational success when being introduced to the aristocracy by her spouse in the drawing room receptions of Europe in the palaces of [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]], [[Vienna]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]] and, most famously, in [[Paris]]. She was celebrated as \"The most beautiful woman in Europe\" and known for her expression: \"My eyes aches\".<ref name=autogenerated1 />\nHer beauty and admired ability to improvise herself out of difficult situations resulted in an admiration and love affairs with several of the most powerful personalities of Europe at the time, which attracted a lot of attention. She was regarded as fashionable decoration at every party in high society in the cities they visited and was courted by monarchs and ministers. \n  \nAt the beginning of their European tour, the couple visited [[Warsaw]]. In early March 1781, she was called to court to be introduced to King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]]. After Warsaw, they visited Berlin, where Zofia was introduced to the King of Prussia [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]]. In the resort town of Spa, Zofia was introduced to the Austrian Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], who was reportedly so fascinated and impressed by her that he ordered [[Mozart]] to compose music on the Turkish harem theme. \nIn one of his letters to his sister, the French queen [[Marie Antoinette]], Joseph II recommended the Witte couple to her. \n\nZofia saw Marie Antoinette at [[Petit Trianon]], which at that time was being rebuilt in a landscaped park. This was possibly what Zofia was inspired to create a similar park. Reportedly, Marie Antoinette was charmed by her and spoke of her as her adopted daughter. During her stay in Paris, Zofia became the lover of both of the French king's brothers; the Count of Provence, later King [[Louis XVIII]], and the Comte d'Artois, the future French king [[Charles X]] respectively.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  \n\nOn November 17, 1781 Zofia gave birth in Paris to a son. When this news reached the Polish king, she personally visited Kamianets and congratulated her father-in-law Josef Witt with the birth of a grandson, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General and volunteered to be the godfather of the newborn. \n\n===Russia===\nIn 1782, the couple returned to Kamianets visiting Vienna, Moravia, Northern Hungary and Galicia on the way. In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. \n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u201392)]], she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of [[Catherine the Great]], which lasted until his death.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> At least during the [[Battle of Khotyn (1788)|Siege of Khotyn]], her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of [[Kherson|Cherson]], and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Later life===\nIn February 1796, Zofia arrived in [[Uman]] and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. In April 17, 1798, in [[Tulchyn]], she remarried [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]], who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. \n\nDuring her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and [[Olga Potocka|Olga]] (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, [[Szcz\u0119sny Jerzy Potocki]], who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> She also had an affair with the Russian governor, [[Nikolai Novosiltsov]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish \"Illuminati\" and died in March 15, 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. \nAs a widow, she was by law only entitled to her [[dowry]] and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> \n\nAs a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother.\n\n===Death===\nIn the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for [[Berlin]] to consult German doctors, where she died. \n\nShe left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. \n\nZofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in [[Talne]] with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church.\n\nZofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Zofia Wittowa.jpeg|{{center|1780}}\nImage:Sofia Wittowa.jpg|{{center|about 1785}}\nImage:Zofia Wittowa Potocka.jpeg|{{center|1790/1800}}\nImage:Zofia Potocka.jpeg|{{center|about 1805}}\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Simon Sebag Montefiore\n | authorlink = Simon Sebag Montefiore\n | title = Potemkin och Katarina den stora \u2013 en kejserliga f\u00f6rbindelse (Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner)\n | publisher =  prisma\n | isbn = 9789151844978\n | year = 2006\n | page=\n | language = Swedish\n}}\n\n*[[Jerzy \u0141ojek|\u0141ojek J.]] (1983, vol.

In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. \n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u201392)]], she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of [[Catherine the Great]], which lasted until his death.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> At least during the [[Battle of Khotyn (1788)|Siege of Khotyn]], her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of [[Kherson|Cherson]], and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Later life===\nIn February 1796, Zofia arrived in [[Uman]] and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. In April 17, 1798, in [[Tulchyn]], she remarried [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]], who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. \n\nDuring her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and [[Olga Potocka|Olga]] (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, [[Szcz\u0119sny Jerzy Potocki]], who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> She also had an affair with the Russian governor, [[Nikolai Novosiltsov]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish \"Illuminati\" and died in March 15, 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. \nAs a widow, she was by law only entitled to her [[dowry]] and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> \n\nAs a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother.\n\n===Death===\nIn the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for [[Berlin]] to consult German doctors, where she died. \n\nShe left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. \n\nZofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in [[Talne]] with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church.\n\nZofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Zofia Wittowa.jpeg|{{center|1780}}\nImage:Sofia Wittowa.jpg|{{center|about 1785}}\nImage:Zofia Wittowa Potocka.jpeg|{{center|1790/1800}}\nImage:Zofia Potocka.jpeg|{{center|about 1805}}\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{cite book\n | author = Simon Sebag Montefiore\n | authorlink = Simon Sebag Montefiore\n | title = Potemkin och Katarina den stora \u2013 en kejserliga f\u00f6rbindelse (Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner)\n | publisher =  prisma\n | isbn = 9789151844978\n | year = 2006\n | page=\n | language = Swedish\n}}\n\n*[[Jerzy \u0141ojek|\u0141ojek J.]] (1983, vol.
