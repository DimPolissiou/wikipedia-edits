On suspect's return to his brother's house in Whitechapel he was watched by police (City CID) by day & night. In a very short time the suspect with his hands tied behind his back, he was sent to [[Stepney]] [[Workhouse]] and then to Colney Hatch and died shortly afterwards - Kosminski was the suspect - DSS\"<ref>'Jack the Ripper: Scotland Yard Investigates' by Stewart P.

Following this, he taught for four years at the [[Naval War College]] in the Department of Strategy, before briefly serving in 1990 on the policy planning staff in the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]]. In 1990, Cohen began teaching at [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|SAIS]]. After the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], he directed the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force's]] official four-volume survey, the [[Gulf War Air Power Survey]], until 1993, for which he received the Air Force's Exemplary Civilian Service Award. This analysis of the effect of U.S. air power was widely referenced in discussions of the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] concept.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1993, [[Paul Wolfowitz]], who would later become prominent as the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] in the run-up to the [[Iraq War]], became Dean of SAIS. During his brief stint at the defense policy planning staff, Cohen had worked under Wolfowitz but this was the first time they were in extended contact.\n\nIn 1997, Cohen co-founded the [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC), which was a center for prominent neoconservatives. He has been a member of the [[Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee]], a committee of civilians and retired military officers that the U.S. Secretary of Defense may call upon for advice, that was instituted during the administration of President [[George W.

In a November 2001 op-ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Cohen identified what he called ''World War IV'' and advocated the overthrow of Iran's government as a possible next step for the [[Bush administration payment of columnists|Bush Administration]]. Cohen claimed \"regime change\" in Iran could be accomplished with a focus on \"pro-Western and anticlerical forces\" in the Middle East and suggested that such an action would be \"wise, moral and unpopular (among some of our allies)\". He went on to argue that such a policy was as important as the then identified goal of [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s capture: \"The overthrow of the first theocratic revolutionary Muslim state and its replacement by a moderate or secular government, however, would be no less important a victory in this war than the annihilation of bin Laden.\"<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001493 ''World War IV: Lets call the conflict what it is''.] ''The Wall Street Journal'' 20 November 2001</ref>\n\nLater in 2001, Cohen, in what was becoming a dominant theme of his writing, advocated war against Iraq once again and proceeded to outline how effortless such a military campaign would be:\n<blockquote>After Afghanistan, what? Iraq is the big prize... One important element will be the use of the Iraqi National Congress to help foster the collapse of the regime, and to provide a replacement for it. The INC, which has received bad, and in some cases malicious treatment, from the State Department and intelligence community over the years, may not be able to do the job with U.S. air support alone.<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95001635 ''Iraq Can't Resist Us. The Gulf War was a cakewalk. The enemy is even weaker now.''.] ''The Wall Street Journal'' 23 December 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of his public statements on why a war against Iraq was necessary, Cohen was invited to appear on ''CNN [[Wolf Blitzer]] Reports'' and amongst other statements given in response to questioning from Blitzer offered the judgment:\n<blockquote>We know that he [Saddam Hussein] supports terror. There's very solid evidence that the Iraqis were behind an attempt to assassinate President Bush's father. And we\u2014by the way, we do know that there is a connection with the 9/11 terrorists. We do know that Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists, met with Iraqi intelligence in Prague.

In my view, the latter course, with all of its risks, is the correct one.

The piece, an attempt to articulate Cohen's self identified roles as academic, pundit, and father, was written as his son prepared to deploy to [[Iraq]] to fight a war the elder Cohen had been calling for since early 2001. The piece ends:\n<blockquote>There is a lot of talk these days about shaky public support for the war. That is not really the issue. Nor should cheerleading, as opposed to truth-telling, be our leaders' chief concern. If we fail in Iraq\u2014and I don't think we will\u2014it won't be because the American people lack heart, but because leaders and institutions have failed. Rather than fretting about support at home, let them show themselves dedicated to waging and winning a strange kind of war and describing it as it is, candidly and in detail. Then the American people will give them all the support they need. The scholar in me is not surprised when our leaders blunder, although the pundit in me is dismayed when they do. What the father in me expects from our leaders is, simply, the truth\u2014an end to happy talk and denials of error, and a seriousness equal to that of the men and women our country sends into the fight.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070802303.html \"A Hawk Questions Himself as His Son Goes to War\"] ''The Washington Post'', 10 July 2005.</ref></blockquote>\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?187812-1/qa-eliot-cohen ''Q&A'' interview with Cohen on his ''Washington Post'' piece, \"A Hawk Questions Himself as His Son Goes to War\", July 31, 2005], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nThis piece was extensively discussed in the blogosphere at the time, with some progressive [[blog]]s decrying that Cohen continued to maintain that the invasion was justified.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Other commentators expressed surprise that a figure with such access and impeccable neoconservative credentials could appear to criticise the Bush Administration in such a way.

The paper criticizes the [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]] for influencing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East away from U.S. interests and towards Israel's interests. [[Eliot Cohen]]  wrote in a prominent [[op-ed]] piece in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that the academic working paper bears all the traditional hallmarks of [[anti-Semitism]]: \"obsessive and irrationally hostile beliefs about Jews\", accusations toward Jews of \"disloyalty, subversion or treachery, of having occult powers and of participating in secret combinations that manipulate institutions and governments\", as well as selection of \"everything unfair, ugly or wrong about Jews as individuals or a group\" and equally systematical suppression of \"any exculpatory information\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Cohen, Eliot|title=Yes, It's Anti-Semitic|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2006-04-05}}</ref> Mearsheimer and Walt have denied Cohen's assertions as false, dishonest and ridiculous, noting that criticism of Israeli state policy and influential American advocates of that policy, such as Cohen, is not the same thing as demonization of Jewish people.<ref name=\"MWResponse\">Mearsheimer, John J. and Walt, Stephen.

In 1990, Cohen began teaching at [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|SAIS]]. After the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], he directed the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force's]] official four-volume survey, the [[Gulf War Air Power Survey]], until 1993, for which he received the Air Force's Exemplary Civilian Service Award. This analysis of the effect of U.S. air power was widely referenced in discussions of the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] concept.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1993, [[Paul Wolfowitz]], who would later become prominent as the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] in the run-up to the [[Iraq War]], became Dean of SAIS.

In a November 2001 op-ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Cohen identified what he called ''World War IV'' and advocated the overthrow of Iran's government as a possible next step for the [[Bush administration payment of columnists|Bush Administration]]. Cohen claimed \"regime change\" in Iran could be accomplished with a focus on \"pro-Western and anticlerical forces\" in the Middle East and suggested that such an action would be \"wise, moral and unpopular (among some of our allies)\". He went on to argue that such a policy was as important as the then identified goal of [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s capture: \"The overthrow of the first theocratic revolutionary Muslim state and its replacement by a moderate or secular government, however, would be no less important a victory in this war than the annihilation of bin Laden.\"<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001493 ''World War IV: Lets call the conflict what it is''.] ''The Wall Street Journal'' 20 November 2001</ref>\n\nLater in 2001, Cohen, in what was becoming a dominant theme of his writing, advocated war against Iraq once again and proceeded to outline how effortless such a military campaign would be:\n<blockquote>After Afghanistan, what? Iraq is the big prize... One important element will be the use of the Iraqi National Congress to help foster the collapse of the regime, and to provide a replacement for it. The INC, which has received bad, and in some cases malicious treatment, from the State Department and intelligence community over the years, may not be able to do the job with U.S. air support alone.<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95001635 ''Iraq Can't Resist Us. The Gulf War was a cakewalk. The enemy is even weaker now.''.] ''The Wall Street Journal'' 23 December 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of his public statements on why a war against Iraq was necessary, Cohen was invited to appear on ''CNN [[Wolf Blitzer]] Reports'' and amongst other statements given in response to questioning from Blitzer offered the judgment:\n<blockquote>We know that he [Saddam Hussein] supports terror. There's very solid evidence that the Iraqis were behind an attempt to assassinate President Bush's father. And we\u2014by the way, we do know that there is a connection with the 9/11 terrorists. We do know that Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists, met with Iraqi intelligence in Prague.

In my view, the latter course, with all of its risks, is the correct one.

The piece, an attempt to articulate Cohen's self identified roles as academic, pundit, and father, was written as his son prepared to deploy to [[Iraq]] to fight a war the elder Cohen had been calling for since early 2001. The piece ends:\n<blockquote>There is a lot of talk these days about shaky public support for the war. That is not really the issue. Nor should cheerleading, as opposed to truth-telling, be our leaders' chief concern. If we fail in Iraq\u2014and I don't think we will\u2014it won't be because the American people lack heart, but because leaders and institutions have failed. Rather than fretting about support at home, let them show themselves dedicated to waging and winning a strange kind of war and describing it as it is, candidly and in detail. Then the American people will give them all the support they need. The scholar in me is not surprised when our leaders blunder, although the pundit in me is dismayed when they do. What the father in me expects from our leaders is, simply, the truth\u2014an end to happy talk and denials of error, and a seriousness equal to that of the men and women our country sends into the fight.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070802303.html \"A Hawk Questions Himself as His Son Goes to War\"] ''The Washington Post'', 10 July 2005.</ref></blockquote>\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?187812-1/qa-eliot-cohen ''Q&A'' interview with Cohen on his ''Washington Post'' piece, \"A Hawk Questions Himself as His Son Goes to War\", July 31, 2005], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nThis piece was extensively discussed in the blogosphere at the time, with some progressive [[blog]]s decrying that Cohen continued to maintain that the invasion was justified.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Other commentators expressed surprise that a figure with such access and impeccable neoconservative credentials could appear to criticise the Bush Administration in such a way.

[[Eliot Cohen]]  wrote in a prominent [[op-ed]] piece in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that the academic working paper bears all the traditional hallmarks of [[anti-Semitism]]: \"obsessive and irrationally hostile beliefs about Jews\", accusations toward Jews of \"disloyalty, subversion or treachery, of having occult powers and of participating in secret combinations that manipulate institutions and governments\", as well as selection of \"everything unfair, ugly or wrong about Jews as individuals or a group\" and equally systematical suppression of \"any exculpatory information\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Cohen, Eliot|title=Yes, It's Anti-Semitic|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2006-04-05}}</ref> Mearsheimer and Walt have denied Cohen's assertions as false, dishonest and ridiculous, noting that criticism of Israeli state policy and influential American advocates of that policy, such as Cohen, is not the same thing as demonization of Jewish people.<ref name=\"MWResponse\">Mearsheimer, John J. and Walt, Stephen.

As a result, the exists were expanded.  7 exits were newly created in front of Grand Hotel, KTCU, Beomeo-dong Doosan We've the Zenith Apartments, in the vicinity of the Suseonggu- Station and Daegu-Suseong Police Department, and were opened in February 1, 2010.  When the exits were expanded, Beomeo World Plaza, an underground store, was newly constructed, in the same manner as Duryu Station, however, development was slow because no stores were coming in, and instead, Daegu City English Street (E-Street) was made instead on April 24, 2012.  However, the Daegu City English Street was not immune from economic downtown, and there was a risk that it may discontinue operations.  Exit number 7, which was newly constructed in 2010, is near Suseong-gu Office and Suseong Police Department, and it is closer to Suseong-gu Office than Suseong-gu Office Station is.\n\nWhen major public events are held in the area of Beomeo Intersection, there are times when access to Beomeo Station is blocked.\n\nOnce Suseong District Stadium Station opened, the demand was split along the line towards East Daegu, and ridership decreased greatly.  However, since ridership was still higher compared to other stations on Line No. 2, screen doors were installed in 2016 for safety.\n\nThe alternative name of this station was Nune Eye Hospital, but this was removed on September 4, 2017.\n\n== Ridership Changes ==\nRidership greatly increased once the exits were expanded in [[2010]] however, after [[\ub300\uad6c \ub3c4\uc2dc\ucca0\ub3c4 3\ud638\uc120]] [[\uc218\uc131\uad6c\ubbfc\uc6b4\ub3d9\uc7a5\uc5ed]] opened, the demand was split towards East Daegu, and ridership greatly decreased.

The first recorded laws dealing with [[prostitution]] were in [[Nova Scotia]] in 1759, although as early as August 19, 1675 the [[Sovereign Council of New France]] convicted Catherine Guichelin, one of the [[King's Daughters]], with leading a \"life scandalous and dishonest to the public\", declared her a prostitute and banished her from the walls of [[Quebec City]] under threat of the [[whip]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jugementsetdli01newf |title=New France Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de Qu\u00e9bec, Chauveau, Pierre-J.-Olivier (Pierre-Joseph-Olivier), 1820-1890, New France.

Most amendments to date have dealt with the latter, originally classified as a ''vagrancy'' offence, this was amended to ''soliciting'' in 1972, and ''communicating'' in 1985. Since the Charter of Rights and Freedoms became law, the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution laws have been challenged on a number of occasions.\n\n==Until the Second World War==\nCanada originally inherited many of its criminal laws from [[England]].  The first legislation dealing with [[prostitution in Canada]] was a [[Nova Scotia]] Act of 1759 which allowed imprisonment for \"lewd behaviour\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/scanned/at_large/volume1/1759.pdf |title=S.N.S. 1759 (1st) c.1 An Act for regulating and maintaining an House of Correction or Work-House within the Town of Halifax, and for binding out of Poor Children |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constancebackhouse.ca/fileadmin/publicationlist/19th_Century_Canadian_Prostitution_Law_-_part_1.pdf |title=Constance Backhouse: Nineteenth-Century Canadian Prostitution Law: Reflection of a discriminatory society Social History 18(35) 1985 387-423 |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>\nMost prostitution in the early days of Canadian history took place in brothels which were in every city.<ref name=\"shaverCE\">{{cite web|author=Frances M.

As in many other countries, what control there was of prostitution existed under [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws designed to keep public places free of \"undesirables\". Owners or operators of brothels (bawdy houses) could also be prosecuted as vagrants. These were based on the British [[Vagrancy Act 1824]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/5/83/contents |title=Vagrancy Act 1824 (c.83) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>\n\nOnce the federal government came into being following [[Confederation (Canada)|Confederation]] in 1867, it became possible to develop common criminal laws for all of Canada.  Women under 21 were protected from 'defilement' from that date, while in 1869, vagrancy provisions were consolidated and extended to include males 'living on the avails' of prostitution. The penalties were increased in 1874, and bawdy houses regulated from 1886.\n\nBy a lack of suitable alternatives, women were annexed into the sex industry. Only from about 1890 was there concern about the actual existence of prostitution, with religious groups, early feminists and women's groups such as [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union#In Canada|Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)]] and the [[National Council of Women of Canada]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Changing women, changing history: a bibliography of the history of women in \u2026|first=Diana |last=Lynn Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iyXrGHOHyBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Changing+women,+changing+history:+a+bibliography+of+the+history+of+women+in+..#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Carleton University Press|year=1996|page=61|isbn=978-0-88629-280-5|accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Harry Gutkin and Mildred Gutkin |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/32/womenwonthevote.shtml |title=Manitoba History: \"Give us our due!\" How Manitoba Women Won the Vote |publisher=Mhs.mb.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> campaigning for [[social purity movement|social purity]] and against prostitution, which was condemned as a 'social evil', and '[[sexual slavery|white slave trade]]', a popular concern of the time. This produced an enthusiasm for rescuing 'fallen women'. However, with increasing action against brothels, more and more people working in prostitution carried out their business on the streets.\n\nThe federal Parliament enacted the first [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] in 1892. Existing provisions were included and refined in the new Code, including making it an offence to procure women 'for unlawful carnal connection'. The laws continued to be amended in various ways over the years. From 1892 to 1972, this created an offence under 175(1)(c) for\n\n<blockquote>''a vagrant who: being a common prostitute or nightwalker is found in a public place and does not, when required, give a good account of herself.''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=drsOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=a+vagrant+who:+being+a+common+prostitute+or+nightwalker+is+found+in+a+public+place+and+does+not,+when+required,+give+a+good+account+of+herself.#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=An introduction to criminal law.

Before 1909 there were few arrests and even fewer fines for prostitution, in part because those caught were encouraged to leave town rather than be jailed. As the population became more settled, however, public opinion regarding this resource for itinerant men turned hostile.   For example, a smallpox epidemic in the red light districts of Calgary ignited a crackdown as demanded by middle-class women reformers. Local chapters of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] vigorously opposed both saloons and prostitution, and called for woman suffrage as a tool to end those evils.<ref>Judy Bedford, \"Prostitution In Calgary 1905-1914\". ''Alberta History'' 1981 29(2): 1-11; Nancy M. Sheehan, \"The WCTU on the Prairies, 1886-1930: An Alberta-Saskatchewan Comparison.\" ''Prairie Forum'' (1981) 6#1 pp 17-33.</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\nThe social purity movement became much less prominent after [[World War I]] but had little effect on the extent of prostitution, but there was now less public concern. Throughout enforcement was heavily gendered, with only a few men prosecuted under the avails and procurement laws. In 1947, it became an offence to transport a woman to a bawdy house.\n<ref name=\"shaverCE\"/>\n\n===Vagrancy===\nThe original 1892 Criminal Code described 12 ways in which a \"loose, idle or disorderly person or vagrant\" might be arrested and upon conviction subjected to a maximum fine of $50 or imprisonment not exceeding six months with or without hard labour. This was directed at the person as \"vagrant\" (status law). In 1954, amendments made vagrancy the doing of a prohibited act, and these were reduced to five. Three of them dealt with street disorder and were nicknamed ''Vag A, B and C'' after the respective clauses, and thus the prostitution prohibition as Vag C or ''vagrancy (c)''.\n\nThe original vagrancy laws were discriminatory in that they were applied overwhelmingly to women and criminalised the status of \"being a common prostitute\" rather than criminalising the behaviours associated with prostitution.  For these reasons, the original status offences for prostitution could be said to contravene the current  [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter]\n\nBoth the judiciary and the 1970 Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women complained about this.\n\nIn 1972 section 164.1:\n\n<blockquote>'''No Apparent Means of Support'''<br>\nEvery one commits vagrancy who:<br>\n       (a) -not having any apparent means of support is found wandering abroad or trespassing and does not, when required, justify his presence in the place where he is found;<br>\n       (b) -begs from door to door or in a public place;<br>\n       (c) -''being a common prostitute or night walker is found in a public place and does not, when required, give a good account of herself''</blockquote>\n\nwas replaced by language prohibiting soliciting (communicating) for the purposes of prostitution (section 195.1), which read:\n<blockquote>''every person who solicits any person in a public place for the purpose of prostitution is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.''</blockquote>\n\nThe new law was now [[gender neutral]] and defined an offence based on an act (although not the nature of the act) and was thought to have addressed the social nuisance concerns of residents. However it soon became clear that there were now new problems.\n\nIn ''Hutt v. R.'' (1978) [SCC 82 D.L.R. (3d) 95] it was held that for the activities of a prostitute to be criminal their conduct must conform to the dictionary definition of \"solicit\"; it must be importuning, or \"pressing or persistent\" and constitute more than a mere indication that she was willing to prostitute herself. A plainclothes police officer permitted the appellant to enter his car. She then identified herself as a prostitute and discussed terms. The Court did not believe that this fell within the intent of parliament to prohibit acts \"which would contribute to public inconvenience.\" Four judges indicated that they would not have considered an automobile a \"public place,\" also excluding the actions from section 195.1. Following this there was concern that the police could no longer act against street prostitution unless there was \"pressing or persistent\" behaviour.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Municipal initiatives===\nResidents started to campaign against sex work as a public nuisance, primarily to have it shifted out of their neighbourhoods. The 1978 ''Hutt'' decision led to public pressure to amend section 195.1 to expand the definition of soliciting. Street prostitution was described as a \" plague\" and there was pressure to deal with activity that was claimed to blight residential and commercial areas, and to be associated with criminal activity, including drugs and exploitation of children.\n\nThe federal government was seen to not be proactive on this prompting some cities to take action. [[Montreal]] (1980) and [[Calgary]] (1981) enacted bylaws that banned the use of streets and other public areas for prostitution. These cities claimed powers, derived from the provinces, to regulate the streets and restrict criminality. Although police and city officials claimed the bylaws to be effective, they were found to be unconstitutional. In ''[[Westendorp v R]]'' (1983) the Supreme Court found the Calgary by\u2011law was ''[[ultra vires]]''. Similarly for Montreal (Goldwax et al. v. City of Montreal, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 525).  These rulings therefore nullified other similar bylaws enacted or proposed in [[Vancouver]], [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. However, a 1983 Montreal by\u2011law forbidding the selling of any services on city streets without a permit was upheld in [[Quebec Superior Court]].\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\nAgitation for change continued at the municipal level as being most directly affected by the presence of prostitution. [[Ottawa]] and [[Edmonton]] created task forces in 1992 while Halifax, Montreal and [[Toronto]] police addressed [[child prostitution|juvenile prostitution]] and, in particular, exiting schemes.\n\n====Ottawa====\nOttawa made 33 recommendations. Many of these focused on enforcement, while others addressed [[crime prevention]], education and crisis intervention programs. Others supported the 1990 C49 report for a re-examination of the Fraser Report. Specifically, these addressed funding for research and more control of harassment or obstruction. The Ottawa report also asked the Minister to work with municipalities to establish a National Crime Prevention Council. In response, the City took action to deter automobile traffic in certain areas.\n\n====Edmonton====\nEdmonton focused on the juvenile issue, proposing amendments to child welfare legislation and the Criminal Code.  It also proposed bylaws to regulate dating and [[escort services]], exotic entertainers and [[Massage parlor|massage parlours]], including licensing, which were subsequently enacted.\n\n====Toronto====\nIn response to the 1995 Federal-Provincial-Territorial Working Group on Prostitution report \"Dealing with Prostitution in Canada,\" Toronto's Board of Health advocated decriminalisation in 1995, with the City taking the responsibility of regulating the industry. The City then endorsed these proposals, further specifying that it involved only adult prostitution, supporting the federal report's proposals on juveniles.\n\nToronto also enacted a bylaw to restrict intimate erotic [[lap dancing]] in August 1995 to prohibit physical contact, including touching, between patrons and attendants, with a maximum fine of $50,000, and revocation of licences. Adult entertainment parlours were unsuccessful in having this quashed by the courts. In Ont. Adult Entertainment Bar Assn. v. Toronto, 26 O.R. (3d) 257 [1995], it was held that the bylaw was enacted for valid objectives relating to business regulation, including health, safety and the prevention of crime, and did not usurp the Government's jurisdiction over criminal law. The court did not believe that the bylaw violated dancers' freedom of expression. Close-contact dancing was not a constitutionally protected right. This was upheld at the appellate level.\n\n====Other====\nOther cities saw Edmonton and Toronto as examples of allowing municipal intervention without being ''[[ultra vires]]'' and the 1990s saw [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Vancouver, Calgary, [[Winnipeg]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] following suit.  [[Civil suit]]s, however, were undertaken on the basis of over-charging licence fees  In 2002, an Edmonton prostitute commenced an action against the City, demanding it lower the license fee for escorts from $1,600. The action claimed that the City of Edmonton was \"living off the avails of prostitution\" by imposing such a high licence fee.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Provincial initiatives===\nIn 1984, the [[Attorney General of British Columbia|British Columbia Attorney General]] applied to the [[B.C. Supreme Court]] for an injunction to restrain, as a common law public nuisance, prostitution\u2011related activity in a residential area of Vancouver. The interim injunction (A.G. B.C. v. Couillard (1984), 42 C.R. (3d) 273) prohibited persons from publicly offering or appearing to offer themselves, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of prostitution, in addition it addressed trespassing and disturbance of the peace by prostitutes. Evidence was presented from residents of the [[West End, Vancouver|West End]] as to the effect on their neighbourhood. However, the interim measure was rescinded after the enactment of new legislation in December 1985.\n\nIn 1984, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia applied for an injunction in the City of Halifax. The application was refused on the grounds of being ''ultra vires''. The [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] upheld this in March 1985 (A.G. N.S. v. Beaver (1985), 67 N.S.R. (2d) 281, 155 A.P.R. 281).\n\nThe provinces have continued to seek ways of controlling prostitution without infringing Parliament's jurisdiction over the Criminal Code. The Traffic and Highway Acts in several provinces have been amended to allow police to seize, impound and sell vehicles of clients.  [[Manitoba]] enacted this in 1999. In 2001 and 2002, Nova Scotia, [[Alberta]], and [[Saskatchewan]] followed. [[Ontario]] went further in 2002 with a civil law allowing the province to ask the courts to freeze, seize and forfeit to the Crown property that is the proceeds of unlawful activity including prostitution, without involving criminal charges. Other provincial Acts authorize the suspension of a driver's licence on conviction of a prostitution related offence involving a motor vehicle.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Inquiries===\n\n====Fraser Committee (1983\u201385)====\nThe Justice Minister established a committee in June 1983 to enquire into prostitution and pornography, headed by Paul Fraser, which reported in April 1985.  The other members of the committee were:  Susan Clark, Mount St Vincent University, Halifax;  Mary Eberts, a civil litigator specialising in equality issues, from Toronto;  Jean-Paul Gilbert, a member of the National Parole Board, Montreal; John McLaren, Dean of Law at the University of Windsor; [[Andr\u00e9e Ruffo]], a lawyer practising in family law in Montreal;  Joan Wallace, a lawyer specialising in human rights, Vancouver.<ref name = \"Fraser report\">[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/131616NCJRS.pdf \"Pornography and Prostitution in Canada - Report of the Special Committee on Pornography and Prostitution - Summary\"], Department of Justice Canada, 1985.</ref>\n\nThat report stated that prostitution was widespread in Canada, particularly in cities. Although empirical evidence was lacking, it concluded that economic necessity was a major motivation for many women. Public opinion was ambivalent. Most people opposed further criminalization, but there was support for actions to alleviate public nuisance associated with it.\n\nIn the report, three strategies were considered; criminalization, decriminalization, and regulation. Further criminalization would prohibit all forms of prostitution but was felt to be impossible to enforce, had little public support, and represented the imposition of moral views through the criminal law. The Committee did not fully support decriminalisation either, on the grounds that it found little evidence that all of the harms would be alleviated. The Committee also rejected regulation by the state.\n\nInstead, the Committee put forward recommendations having elements of all three approaches. For the first time, recommendations addressed underlying economic and social issues, whose alleviation might improve the situation.  The Committee recommended addressing social inequalities between genders, assisting women and youth in need, and funding of community groups involved with prostitution.\n\nWhile the Committee (with one dissension) did not support complete decriminalisation, it suggested thorough revision of the criminal law, with tougher penalties for street prostitution because of the harm of disturbance and nuisance. It suggested a new offence of interfering or attempting to interfere, on more than one occasion, with pedestrian or vehicular traffic for the purposes of offering to engage in prostitution or of employing the services of a prostitute but not the mere offer or acceptance without disturbance.\n\nThis was to be balanced by easing restrictions on other activities. Bawdy house provisions were to be amended to allow up to two workers on a premise as out was illogical to permit prostitution but make it illegal to perform it anywhere. The committee thought that a maximum of two persons would be unlikely to be associated with public nuisance and would allow a worker to use their own home. It also proposed that prostitution establishments be permitted to be licensed and operated by provincial or territorial governments, like other businesses.\n\nThe Committee recommended repeal of the offences of procuring and living on the avails of prostitution, limiting this to the use of force, threats or other coercive or threatening behaviour. The Committee concluded its report as follows:\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n<blockquote>''Prostitution cannot be dealt with on a piecemeal basis, but only by carefully linking the provisions on each aspect of prostitution-related activity.''\n</blockquote>\nResponse was varied. Authorities were positive about strengthening measures against street work, but negative about relaxing sanctions against indoor work, and no support emerged at the Provincial level.\n\n====C-49 Review (1987-90)====\nBill C-49 (1985) stated its objectives were to remove \"street prostitutes and their customers from \"downtown neighbourhoods.\" It also mandated a review within three years. A research study was therefore undertaken in 1987\u201388 to determine whether C-49 resulted in \"a reduction in the nuisance of street prostitution [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] were chosen as major test sites, with smaller studies in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Winnipeg]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Ottawa]], [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] and [[Quebec City]]. Interviews were conducted with police officers, Crown prosecutors, defence lawyers, judges, prostitutes, customers, pimps, social agency staff, and business people and residents. Baseline data was available from the 1984 report of the Fraser Committee. The report, \"Street Prostitution:  Assessing the Impact of the Law\" was published in July 1989 by the Department of Justice.  The report concluded that although the\n\n<blockquote>''practice of street prostitution was modified somewhat by the communicating law ... (i)n most of the cities included in the study, street prostitution was as prevalent as it was before the new law.''</blockquote>\n\nIn 1989, the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General conducted a comprehensive review of Bill C\u201149, reporting in October 1990. Its three recommendations were the following:\n\n- '''(1)'''  that the departments responsible for justice, health and welfare, and employment, at all levels of government, develop programs to provide start\u2011up and core funding to community\u2011based agencies providing integrated, holistic programs accessible and responsive to the needs of male and female prostitutes wishing to leave the street solicitation trade;\n\n- '''(2)'''  that the Identification of Criminals Act be amended to allow for the fingerprinting and photographing of those charged under section 213 of the Criminal Code, whether as prostitutes or as customers; and\n\n- '''(3)'''  that section 213 of the Criminal Code be amended to provide sentencing judges with the discretion to prohibit persons convicted of street solicitation involving a motor vehicle, in addition to any other penalty imposed, from driving a motor vehicle for a period not to exceed three months.\n\nEssentially, in its 1991 response, the government rejected the recommendations and did not amend legislation. It suggested that rather than proceed with developing exit strategies, further consultation should be undertaken, and that further penalties would not enhance exiting. The final recommendation was also rejected as being irrational.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Further amendments to the Criminal Code===\nDespite the apparently neutral language of the law, the courts continued to interpret 'person' as woman, requiring a 1983 amendment defining \"prostitute\" as a person of either sex who engages in prostitution.\n\nThe next problem, also relating to gender neutrality, was the issue of whether it was discriminatory, applying only to the seller not the buyer. Case law was inconsistent. The [[B.C. Court of Appeal]] held \"for the purpose of prostitution\" referred only to the seller (R. v. Dudak (1978), 3 C.R. (3d) 68) while the Ontario Court of Appeal held (in R. v. DiPaola (1978), 4 C.R. (3d) 121) that it referred to either party.\n\n====C-49 (1985)====\nIt was clear that the law needed to be reviewed, and Bill C\u201149 was introduced in 1985, coming into force on December 28, 1985, replacing section 195.1. The new offence (section 213) referred to any person in a public place (or place open to public view) who stopped or attempted to stop a motor vehicle, impeded pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or interfered with the entry to a building, or stopped any person or engaged in\n<blockquote>''communicating in a public place for the purposes of prostitution''</blockquote>\n\"Public place\" was defined as including motor vehicles in or on public places. This section was to be reviewed after three years. The Justice Minister stated that further amendments would be forthcoming, but nothing came of this. The section was challenged unsuccessfully in the Supreme Court in 1990. The new section was welcomed by citizens and authorities, but critics claimed it would merely displace the phenomenon, endanger workers, and give the police and court too much discretionary power.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n====C-15 (1988)====\nIn 1988 Bill C\u201115 made it an offence to obtain or attempt to obtain the sexual services of a minor, increasing the maximum penalty to 14 years for anyone convicted of living on the avails of a prostitute under the age of 18 years.\n<ref name=\"justice03\">{{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/822-e.htm |first=James R. |last=Robertson|title=Prostitution |publisher=Department of Justice |date=19 September 2003 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>\n\n====C-36 (2014) ====\n[[File:Bill C-36 Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Sign about Bill C-36 in a [[massage parlor]] in [[Montreal]], September 2015]]\nFollowing a declaration by the Supreme Court in December 2013 that certain key provisions in the existing law were unconstitutional, [[Peter MacKay]] introduced Bill C-36, the ''Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act'' in June 2014.

Since the Charter of Rights and Freedoms became law, the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution laws have been challenged on a number of occasions.\n\n==Until the Second World War==\nCanada originally inherited many of its criminal laws from [[England]].  The first legislation dealing with [[prostitution in Canada]] was a [[Nova Scotia]] Act of 1759 which allowed imprisonment for \"lewd behaviour\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/scanned/at_large/volume1/1759.pdf |title=S.N.S. 1759 (1st) c.1 An Act for regulating and maintaining an House of Correction or Work-House within the Town of Halifax, and for binding out of Poor Children |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constancebackhouse.ca/fileadmin/publicationlist/19th_Century_Canadian_Prostitution_Law_-_part_1.pdf |title=Constance Backhouse: Nineteenth-Century Canadian Prostitution Law: Reflection of a discriminatory society Social History 18(35) 1985 387-423 |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>\nMost prostitution in the early days of Canadian history took place in brothels which were in every city.<ref name=\"shaverCE\">{{cite web|author=Frances M.

As in many other countries, what control there was of prostitution existed under [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws designed to keep public places free of \"undesirables\". Owners or operators of brothels (bawdy houses) could also be prosecuted as vagrants. These were based on the British [[Vagrancy Act 1824]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/5/83/contents |title=Vagrancy Act 1824 (c.83) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>\n\nOnce the federal government came into being following [[Confederation (Canada)|Confederation]] in 1867, it became possible to develop common criminal laws for all of Canada.  Women under 21 were protected from 'defilement' from that date, while in 1869, vagrancy provisions were consolidated and extended to include males 'living on the avails' of prostitution. The penalties were increased in 1874, and bawdy houses regulated from 1886.\n\nBy a lack of suitable alternatives, women were annexed into the sex industry. Only from about 1890 was there concern about the actual existence of prostitution, with religious groups, early feminists and women's groups such as [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union#In Canada|Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)]] and the [[National Council of Women of Canada]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Changing women, changing history: a bibliography of the history of women in \u2026|first=Diana |last=Lynn Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iyXrGHOHyBAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Changing+women,+changing+history:+a+bibliography+of+the+history+of+women+in+..#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Carleton University Press|year=1996|page=61|isbn=978-0-88629-280-5|accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Harry Gutkin and Mildred Gutkin |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/32/womenwonthevote.shtml |title=Manitoba History: \"Give us our due!\" How Manitoba Women Won the Vote |publisher=Mhs.mb.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> campaigning for [[social purity movement|social purity]] and against prostitution, which was condemned as a 'social evil', and '[[sexual slavery|white slave trade]]', a popular concern of the time. This produced an enthusiasm for rescuing 'fallen women'. However, with increasing action against brothels, more and more people working in prostitution carried out their business on the streets.\n\nThe federal Parliament enacted the first [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] in 1892. Existing provisions were included and refined in the new Code, including making it an offence to procure women 'for unlawful carnal connection'. The laws continued to be amended in various ways over the years. From 1892 to 1972, this created an offence under 175(1)(c) for\n\n<blockquote>''a vagrant who: being a common prostitute or nightwalker is found in a public place and does not, when required, give a good account of herself.''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=drsOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=a+vagrant+who:+being+a+common+prostitute+or+nightwalker+is+found+in+a+public+place+and+does+not,+when+required,+give+a+good+account+of+herself.#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=An introduction to criminal law.

Before 1909 there were few arrests and even fewer fines for prostitution, in part because those caught were encouraged to leave town rather than be jailed. As the population became more settled, however, public opinion regarding this resource for itinerant men turned hostile.   For example, a smallpox epidemic in the red light districts of Calgary ignited a crackdown as demanded by middle class women reformers. Local chapters of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] vigorously opposed both saloons and prostitution, and called for woman suffrage as a tool to end those evils.<ref>Judy Bedford, \"Prostitution In Calgary 1905-1914\".

Sheehan, \"The WCTU on the Prairies, 1886-1930: An Alberta-Saskatchewan Comparison.\" ''Prairie Forum'' (1981) 6#1 pp 17-33.</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\nThe social purity movement became much less prominent after [[World War I]] but had little effect on the extent of prostitution, but there was now less public concern. Throughout enforcement was heavily gendered, with only a few men prosecuted under the avails and procurement laws. In 1947, it became an offence to transport a woman to a bawdy house.\n<ref name=\"shaverCE\"/>\n\n===Vagrancy===\nThe original 1892 Criminal Code described 12 ways in which a \"loose, idle or disorderly person or vagrant\" might be arrested and upon conviction subjected to a maximum fine of $50 or imprisonment not exceeding six months with or without hard labour. This was directed at the person as \"vagrant\" (status law). In 1954, amendments made vagrancy the doing of a prohibited act, and these were reduced to five. Three of them dealt with street disorder and were nicknamed ''Vag A, B and C'' after the respective clauses, and thus the prostitution prohibition as Vag C or ''vagrancy (c)''.\n\nThe original vagrancy laws were discriminatory in that they were applied overwhelmingly to women and criminalised the status of \"being a common prostitute\" rather than criminalising the behaviours associated with prostitution.  For these reasons, the original status offences for prostitution could be said to contravene the current  [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter]\n\nBoth the judiciary and the 1970 Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women complained about this.\n\nIn 1972 section 164.1:\n\n<blockquote>'''No Apparent Means of Support'''<br>\nEvery one commits vagrancy who:<br>\n       (a) -not having any apparent means of support is found wandering abroad or trespassing and does not, when required, justify his presence in the place where he is found;<br>\n       (b) -begs from door to door or in a public place;<br>\n       (c) -''being a common prostitute or night walker is found in a public place and does not, when required, give a good account of herself''</blockquote>\n\nwas replaced by language prohibiting soliciting (communicating) for the purposes of prostitution (section 195.1), which read:\n<blockquote>''every person who solicits any person in a public place for the purpose of prostitution is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.''</blockquote>\n\nThe new law was now [[gender neutral]] and defined an offence based on an act (although not the nature of the act) and was thought to have addressed the social nuisance concerns of residents. However it soon became clear that there were now new problems.\n\nIn ''Hutt v. R.'' (1978) [SCC 82 D.L.R. (3d) 95] it was held that for the activities of a prostitute to be criminal their conduct must conform to the dictionary definition of \"solicit\"; it must be importuning, or \"pressing or persistent\" and constitute more than a mere indication that she was willing to prostitute herself. A plainclothes police officer permitted the appellant to enter his car. She then identified herself as a prostitute and discussed terms. The Court did not believe that this fell within the intent of parliament to prohibit acts \"which would contribute to public inconvenience.\" Four judges indicated that they would not have considered an automobile a \"public place,\" also excluding the actions from section 195.1. Following this there was concern that the police could no longer act against street prostitution unless there was \"pressing or persistent\" behaviour.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Municipal initiatives===\nResidents started to campaign against sex work as a public nuisance, primarily to have it shifted out of their neighbourhoods. The 1978 ''Hutt'' decision led to public pressure to amend section 195.1 to expand the definition of soliciting. Street prostitution was described as a \" plague\" and there was pressure to deal with activity that was claimed to blight residential and commercial areas, and to be associated with criminal activity, including drugs and exploitation of children.\n\nThe federal government was seen to not be proactive on this prompting some cities to take action. [[Montreal]] (1980) and [[Calgary]] (1981) enacted bylaws that banned the use of streets and other public areas for prostitution. These cities claimed powers, derived from the provinces, to regulate the streets and restrict criminality. Although police and city officials claimed the bylaws to be effective, they were found to be unconstitutional. In ''[[Westendorp v R]]'' (1983) the Supreme Court found the Calgary by\u2011law was ''[[ultra vires]]''. Similarly for Montreal (Goldwax et al. v. City of Montreal, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 525).  These rulings therefore nullified other similar bylaws enacted or proposed in [[Vancouver]], [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. However, a 1983 Montreal by\u2011law forbidding the selling of any services on city streets without a permit was upheld in [[Quebec Superior Court]].\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\nAgitation for change continued at the municipal level as being most directly affected by the presence of prostitution. [[Ottawa]] and [[Edmonton]] created task forces in 1992 while Halifax, Montreal and [[Toronto]] police addressed [[child prostitution|juvenile prostitution]] and, in particular, exiting schemes.\n\n====Ottawa====\nOttawa made 33 recommendations. Many of these focused on enforcement, while others addressed [[crime prevention]], education and crisis intervention programs. Others supported the 1990 C49 report for a re-examination of the Fraser Report. Specifically, these addressed funding for research and more control of harassment or obstruction. The Ottawa report also asked the Minister to work with municipalities to establish a National Crime Prevention Council. In response, the City took action to deter automobile traffic in certain areas.\n\n====Edmonton====\nEdmonton focused on the juvenile issue, proposing amendments to child welfare legislation and the Criminal Code.  It also proposed bylaws to regulate dating and [[escort services]], exotic entertainers and [[Massage parlor|massage parlours]], including licensing, which were subsequently enacted.\n\n====Toronto====\nIn response to the 1995 Federal-Provincial-Territorial Working Group on Prostitution report \"Dealing with Prostitution in Canada,\" Toronto's Board of Health advocated decriminalisation in 1995, with the City taking the responsibility of regulating the industry. The City then endorsed these proposals, further specifying that it involved only adult prostitution, supporting the federal report's proposals on juveniles.\n\nToronto also enacted a bylaw to restrict intimate erotic [[lap dancing]] in August 1995 to prohibit physical contact, including touching, between patrons and attendants, with a maximum fine of $50,000, and revocation of licences. Adult entertainment parlours were unsuccessful in having this quashed by the courts. In Ont. Adult Entertainment Bar Assn. v. Toronto, 26 O.R. (3d) 257 [1995], it was held that the bylaw was enacted for valid objectives relating to business regulation, including health, safety and the prevention of crime, and did not usurp the Government's jurisdiction over criminal law. The court did not believe that the bylaw violated dancers' freedom of expression. Close-contact dancing was not a constitutionally protected right. This was upheld at the appellate level.\n\n====Other====\nOther cities saw Edmonton and Toronto as examples of allowing municipal intervention without being ''[[ultra vires]]'' and the 1990s saw [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Vancouver, Calgary, [[Winnipeg]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] following suit.  [[Civil suit]]s, however, were undertaken on the basis of over-charging licence fees  In 2002, an Edmonton prostitute commenced an action against the City, demanding it lower the license fee for escorts from $1,600. The action claimed that the City of Edmonton was \"living off the avails of prostitution\" by imposing such a high licence fee.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Provincial initiatives===\nIn 1984, the [[Attorney General of British Columbia|British Columbia Attorney General]] applied to the [[B.C. Supreme Court]] for an injunction to restrain, as a common law public nuisance, prostitution\u2011related activity in a residential area of Vancouver. The interim injunction (A.G. B.C. v. Couillard (1984), 42 C.R. (3d) 273) prohibited persons from publicly offering or appearing to offer themselves, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of prostitution, in addition it addressed trespassing and disturbance of the peace by prostitutes. Evidence was presented from residents of the [[West End, Vancouver|West End]] as to the effect on their neighbourhood. However, the interim measure was rescinded after the enactment of new legislation in December 1985.\n\nIn 1984, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia applied for an injunction in the City of Halifax. The application was refused on the grounds of being ''ultra vires''. The [[Nova Scotia Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] upheld this in March 1985 (A.G. N.S. v. Beaver (1985), 67 N.S.R. (2d) 281, 155 A.P.R. 281).\n\nThe provinces have continued to seek ways of controlling prostitution without infringing Parliament's jurisdiction over the Criminal Code. The Traffic and Highway Acts in several provinces have been amended to allow police to seize, impound and sell vehicles of clients.  [[Manitoba]] enacted this in 1999. In 2001 and 2002, Nova Scotia, [[Alberta]], and [[Saskatchewan]] followed. [[Ontario]] went further in 2002 with a civil law allowing the province to ask the courts to freeze, seize and forfeit to the Crown property that is the proceeds of unlawful activity including prostitution, without involving criminal charges. Other provincial Acts authorize the suspension of a driver's licence on conviction of a prostitution related offence involving a motor vehicle.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Inquiries===\n\n====Fraser Committee (1983\u201385)====\nThe Justice Minister established a committee in June 1983 to enquire into prostitution and pornography, headed by Paul Fraser, which reported in April 1985.  The other members of the committee were:  Susan Clark, Mount St Vincent University, Halifax;  Mary Eberts, a civil litigator specialising in equality issues, from Toronto;  Jean-Paul Gilbert, a member of the National Parole Board, Montreal; John McLaren, Dean of Law at the University of Windsor; [[Andr\u00e9e Ruffo]], a lawyer practising in family law in Montreal;  Joan Wallace, a lawyer specialising in human rights, Vancouver.<ref name = \"Fraser report\">[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/131616NCJRS.pdf \"Pornography and Prostitution in Canada - Report of the Special Committee on Pornography and Prostitution - Summary\"], Department of Justice Canada, 1985.</ref>\n\nThat report stated that prostitution was widespread in Canada, particularly in cities. Although empirical evidence was lacking, it concluded that economic necessity was a major motivation for many women. Public opinion was ambivalent. Most people opposed further criminalization, but there was support for actions to alleviate public nuisance associated with it.\n\nIn the report, three strategies were considered; criminalization, decriminalization, and regulation. Further criminalization would prohibit all forms of prostitution but was felt to be impossible to enforce, had little public support, and represented the imposition of moral views through the criminal law. The Committee did not fully support decriminalisation either, on the grounds that it found little evidence that all of the harms would be alleviated. The Committee also rejected regulation by the state.\n\nInstead, the Committee put forward recommendations having elements of all three approaches. For the first time, recommendations addressed underlying economic and social issues, whose alleviation might improve the situation.  The Committee recommended addressing social inequalities between genders, assisting women and youth in need, and funding of community groups involved with prostitution.\n\nWhile the Committee (with one dissension) did not support complete decriminalisation, it suggested thorough revision of the criminal law, with tougher penalties for street prostitution because of the harm of disturbance and nuisance. It suggested a new offence of interfering or attempting to interfere, on more than one occasion, with pedestrian or vehicular traffic for the purposes of offering to engage in prostitution or of employing the services of a prostitute but not the mere offer or acceptance without disturbance.\n\nThis was to be balanced by easing restrictions on other activities. Bawdy house provisions were to be amended to allow up to two workers on a premise as out was illogical to permit prostitution but make it illegal to perform it anywhere. The committee thought that a maximum of two persons would be unlikely to be associated with public nuisance and would allow a worker to use their own home. It also proposed that prostitution establishments be permitted to be licensed and operated by provincial or territorial governments, like other businesses.\n\nThe Committee recommended repeal of the offences of procuring and living on the avails of prostitution, limiting this to the use of force, threats or other coercive or threatening behaviour. The Committee concluded its report as follows:\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n<blockquote>''Prostitution cannot be dealt with on a piecemeal basis, but only by carefully linking the provisions on each aspect of prostitution-related activity.''\n</blockquote>\nResponse was varied. Authorities were positive about strengthening measures against street work, but negative about relaxing sanctions against indoor work, and no support emerged at the Provincial level.\n\n====C-49 Review (1987-90)====\nBill C-49 (1985) stated its objectives were to remove \"street prostitutes and their customers from \"downtown neighbourhoods.\" It also mandated a review within three years. A research study was therefore undertaken in 1987-88 to determine whether C-49 resulted in \"a reduction in the nuisance of street prostitution [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] were chosen as major test sites, with smaller studies in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Winnipeg]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Ottawa]], [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] and [[Quebec City]]. Interviews were conducted with police officers, Crown prosecutors, defence lawyers, judges, prostitutes, customers, pimps, social agency staff, and business people and residents. Baseline data was available from the 1984 report of the Fraser Committee. The report, \"Street Prostitution:  Assessing the Impact of the Law\" was published in July 1989 by the Department of Justice.  The report concluded that although the\n\n<blockquote>''practice of street prostitution was modified somewhat by the communicating law ... (i)n most of the cities included in the study, street prostitution was as prevalent as it was before the new law.''</blockquote>\n\nIn 1989, the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General conducted a comprehensive review of Bill C\u201149, reporting in October 1990. Its three recommendations were the following:\n\n- '''(1)'''  that the departments responsible for justice, health and welfare, and employment, at all levels of government, develop programs to provide start\u2011up and core funding to community\u2011based agencies providing integrated, holistic programs accessible and responsive to the needs of male and female prostitutes wishing to leave the street solicitation trade;\n\n- '''(2)'''  that the Identification of Criminals Act be amended to allow for the fingerprinting and photographing of those charged under section 213 of the Criminal Code, whether as prostitutes or as customers; and\n\n- '''(3)'''  that section 213 of the Criminal Code be amended to provide sentencing judges with the discretion to prohibit persons convicted of street solicitation involving a motor vehicle, in addition to any other penalty imposed, from driving a motor vehicle for a period not to exceed three months.\n\nEssentially, in its 1991 response, the government rejected the recommendations and did not amend legislation. It suggested that rather than proceed with developing exit strategies, further consultation should be undertaken, and that further penalties would not enhance exiting. The final recommendation was also rejected as being irrational.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n===Further amendments to the Criminal Code===\nDespite the apparently neutral language of the law, the courts continued to interpret 'person' as woman, requiring a 1983 amendment defining \"prostitute\" as a person of either sex who engages in prostitution.\n\nThe next problem, also relating to gender neutrality, was the issue of whether it was discriminatory, applying only to the seller not the buyer. Case law was inconsistent. The [[B.C. Court of Appeal]] held \"for the purpose of prostitution\" referred only to the seller (R. v. Dudak (1978), 3 C.R. (3d) 68) while the Ontario Court of Appeal held (in R. v. DiPaola (1978), 4 C.R. (3d) 121) that it referred to either party.\n\n====C-49 (1985)====\nIt was clear that the law needed to be reviewed, and Bill C\u201149 was introduced in 1985, coming into force on December 28, 1985, replacing section 195.1. The new offence (section 213) referred to any person in a public place (or place open to public view) who stopped or attempted to stop a motor vehicle, impeded pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or interfered with the entry to a building, or stopped any person or engaged in\n<blockquote>''communicating in a public place for the purposes of prostitution''</blockquote>\n\"Public place\" was defined as including motor vehicles in or on public places. This section was to be reviewed after three years. The Justice Minister stated that further amendments would be forthcoming, but nothing came of this. The section was challenged unsuccessfully in the Supreme Court in 1990. The new section was welcomed by citizens and authorities, but critics claimed it would merely displace the phenomenon, endanger workers, and give the police and court too much discretionary power.\n<ref name=\"justice03\"/>\n\n====C-15 (1988)====\nIn 1988 Bill C\u201115 made it an offence to obtain or attempt to obtain the sexual services of a minor, increasing the maximum penalty to 14 years for anyone convicted of living on the avails of a prostitute under the age of 18 years.\n<ref name=\"justice03\">{{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/822-e.htm |first=James R. |last=Robertson|title=Prostitution |publisher=Department of Justice |date=19 September 2003 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>\n\n====C-36 (2014) ====\n[[File:Bill C-36 Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Sign about Bill C-36 in a [[massage parlor]] in [[Montreal]], September 2015]]\nFollowing a declaration by the Supreme Court in December 2013 that certain key provisions in the existing law were unconstitutional, [[Peter MacKay]] introduced Bill C-36, the ''Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act'' in June 2014.

{"title_page": "Angular momentum operator", "text_new": "{{quantum mechanics}}{{Short description|Quantum mechanical operator related to rotational symmetry}}In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''angular momentum operator''' is one of several related [[operator (physics)|operators]] analogous to classical [[angular momentum]]. The angular momentum operator plays a central role in the theory of [[atomic physics]] and other quantum problems involving [[rotational symmetry]].  In both classical and quantum mechanical systems, angular momentum (together with [[linear momentum]] and [[energy]]) is one of the three fundamental properties of motion.<ref name=\"Liboff\">Introductory Quantum Mechanics, [[Richard L. Liboff]], 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|0-201-54715-5}}</ref>\n\nThere are several angular momentum operators: '''total angular momentum''' (usually denoted '''J'''), '''orbital angular momentum''' (usually denoted '''L'''), and '''spin angular momentum''' ('''spin''' for short, usually denoted '''S'''). The term ''angular momentum operator'' can (confusingly) refer to either the total or the orbital angular momentum. Total angular momentum is always [[conservation of angular momentum|conserved]], see [[Noether's theorem]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:LS coupling.svg|250px|thumb|\"Vector cones\" of total angular momentum '''J''' (purple), orbital '''L''' (blue), and spin '''S''' (green). The cones arise due to [[quantum uncertainty]] between measuring angular momentum components ([[#Visual interpretation|see below]]).]]\n\nIn quantum mechanics, angular momentum can refer to one of three different, but related things.\n\n===Orbital angular momentum===\nThe [[angular momentum|classical definition of angular momentum]] is <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{p}</math>. The quantum-mechanical counterparts of these objects share the same relationship:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{p}</math>\n\nwhere '''r''' is the quantum [[position operator]], '''p''' is the quantum [[momentum operator]], \u00d7 is [[cross product]], and '''L''' is the ''orbital angular momentum operator''. '''L''' (just like '''p''' and '''r''') is a ''vector operator'' (a vector whose components are operators), i.e. <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\left(L_x, L_y, L_z\\right)</math> where ''L''<sub>x</sub>, ''L''<sub>y</sub>, ''L''<sub>z</sub> are three different quantum-mechanical operators.\n\nIn the special case of a single particle with no [[electric charge]] and no [[spin (physics)|spin]], the orbital angular momentum operator can be written in the position basis as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = -i\\hbar(\\mathbf{r} \\times \\nabla)</math>\n\nwhere \u2207 is the vector differential operator, [[del]].\n\n===Spin angular momentum===\n{{main|Spin (physics)}}\nThere is another type of angular momentum, called [[spin (physics)|''spin angular momentum'']] (more often shortened to ''spin''), represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is only a metaphor: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space. All [[elementary particles]] have a characteristic spin, which is usually nonzero. For example, [[electron]]s always have \"spin 1/2\" while [[photon]]s always have \"spin 1\" (details [[#Quantization|below]]).\n\n===Total angular momentum===\nFinally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of a particle or system:\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{S}.</math>\n\n[[Conservation of angular momentum]] states that '''J''' for a closed system, or '''J''' for the whole universe, is conserved. However, '''L''' and '''S''' are ''not'' generally conserved. For example, the [[spin\u2013orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total '''J''' remaining constant.\n\n==Commutation relations==\n\n===Commutation relations between components===\nThe orbital angular momentum operator is a vector operator, meaning it can be written in terms of its vector components <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\left(L_x, L_y, L_z\\right)</math>. The components have the following [[commutation relation]]s with each other:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRsvmTFpB3wC&pg=PA171|title= Quantum Mechanics|first=G. |last=Aruldhas|page=171|chapter= formula (8.8)|isbn=978-81-203-1962-2|date=2004-02-01}}</ref>\n:<math>\\left[L_x, L_y\\right] = i\\hbar L_z, \\;\\; \\left[L_y, L_z\\right] = i\\hbar L_x, \\;\\; \\left[L_z, L_x\\right] = i\\hbar L_y,</math>\n\nwhere [&nbsp;,&nbsp;] denotes the [[commutator (ring theory)|commutator]]\n: <math>[X, Y] \\equiv XY - YX.</math>\n\nThis can be written generally as\n:<math>\\left[L_l, L_m\\right] = i \\hbar \\sum_{n=1}^{3} \\varepsilon_{lmn} L_n</math>,\n\nwhere ''l'', ''m'', ''n'' are the component indices (1 for ''x'', 2 for ''y'', 3 for ''z''), and ''\u03b5<sub>lmn</sub>'' denotes the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].\n\nA compact expression as one vector equation is also possible:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shankar|first1=R.|title=Principles of quantum mechanics|date=1994|publisher=Kluwer Academic / Plenum|location=New York|isbn=9780306447907|page=319|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{L} = i\\hbar \\mathbf{L}</math>\n\nThe commutation relations can be proved as a direct consequence of the [[canonical commutation relation]]s <math>[x_l,p_m]=i \\hbar \\delta_{lm}</math>, where ''\u03b4<sub>lm</sub>'' is the [[Kronecker delta]].\n\nThere is an analogous relationship in classical physics:<ref>H. Goldstein, C. P. Poole and J. Safko, ''Classical Mechanics, 3rd Edition'', Addison-Wesley 2002, pp. 388 ff.</ref>\n:<math>\\left\\{L_i, L_j\\right\\} = \\varepsilon_{ijk} L_k</math>\n\nwhere ''L''<sub>''n''</sub> is a component of the ''classical'' angular momentum operator, and <math>\\{ ,\\}</math> is the [[Poisson bracket]].\n\nThe same commutation relations apply for the other angular momentum operators (spin and total angular momentum):<ref name=littlejohn/>\n:<math>\\left[S_l, S_m\\right] = i \\hbar \\sum_{n=1}^{3} \\varepsilon_{lmn} S_n, \\quad \\left[J_l, J_m\\right] = i \\hbar \\sum_{n=1}^{3} \\varepsilon_{lmn} J_n</math>.\n\nThese can be ''assumed'' to hold in analogy with '''L'''. Alternatively, they can be ''derived'' as discussed [[#Connection to commutation relations|below]].\n\nThese commutation relations mean that '''L''' has the mathematical structure of a [[Lie algebra]], and the ''\u03b5<sub>lmn</sub>'' are its [[structure constant]]s. In this case, the Lie algebra is [[SU(2)#Lie algebra|SU(2)]] or [[SO(3)#Lie algebra|SO(3)]] in physics notation (<math>\\operatorname{su}(2)</math> or <math>\\operatorname{so}(3)</math> respectively in mathematics notation), i.e. Lie algebra associated with rotations in three dimensions. The same is true of '''J''' and '''S'''. The reason is discussed [[#Angular momentum as the generator of rotations|below]]. These commutation relations are relevant for measurement and uncertainty, as discussed further below.\n\n===Commutation relations involving vector magnitude===\nLike any vector, a [[Euclidean norm|magnitude]] can be defined for the orbital angular momentum operator,\n:<math>L^2 \\equiv L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2</math> .\n\n'''''L'''''<sup>2</sup> is another quantum [[operator (mathematics)|operator]].

Two complementary observables cannot be measured simultaneously; instead they satisfy an [[uncertainty principle]]. The more accurately one observable is known, the less accurately the other one can be known. Just as there is an uncertainty principle relating position and momentum, there are uncertainty principles for angular momentum.\n\nThe [[uncertainty principle|Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation]] gives the following uncertainty principle:\n:<math>\\sigma_{L_x} \\sigma_{L_y} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left| \\langle L_z \\rangle \\right|.</math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma_X</math> is the [[standard deviation]] in the measured values of ''X'' and <math>\\langle X \\rangle</math> denotes the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of ''X''. This inequality is also true if ''x, y, z'' are rearranged, or if ''L'' is replaced by ''J'' or ''S''.\n\nTherefore, two orthogonal components of angular momentum (for example L<sub>x</sub> and L<sub>y</sub>) are complementary and cannot be simultaneously known or measured, except in special cases such as <math>L_x = L_y = L_z = 0</math>.\n\nIt is, however, possible to simultaneously measure or specify ''L''<sup>2</sup> and any one component of ''L''; for example, ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>. This is often useful, and the values are characterized by the [[azimuthal quantum number]] (''l'') and the [[magnetic quantum number]] (''m''). In this case the quantum state of the system is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>, but ''not'' of ''L''<sub>x</sub> or ''L''<sub>y</sub>. The eigenvalues are related to ''l'' and ''m'', as shown in the table below.\n\n==Quantization==\n{{see also|Azimuthal quantum number|Magnetic quantum number}}\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is ''quantized'' \u2013 that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in \"quantum leaps\" between certain allowed values. For any system, the following restrictions on measurement results apply, where <math>\\hbar</math> is [[reduced Planck constant]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]\n\n===Derivation using ladder operators===\n{{main|Ladder operator#Angular momentum}}\nA common way to derive the quantization rules above is the method of ''[[ladder operator]]s''.<ref name=Griffithsladder>{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=1995 | pages=147\u2013149}}</ref> The ladder operators are defined:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  J_+ &\\equiv J_x + i J_y, \\\\\n  J_- &\\equiv J_x - i J_y\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSuppose a state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is a state in the simultaneous eigenbasis of <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z</math> (i.e., a state with a single, definite value of <math>J^2</math> and a single, definite value of <math>J_z</math>). Then using the commutation relations, one can prove that <math>J_+ |\\psi\\rangle</math> and <math>J_-|\\psi\\rangle</math> are ''also'' in the simultaneous eigenbasis, with the same value of <math>J^2</math>, but where <math>J_z |\\psi\\rangle</math> is increased or decreased by <math>\\hbar</math>, respectively. (It is also possible that one or both of these result vectors is the zero vector.) (For a proof, see [[ladder operator#Angular momentum]].)\n\nBy manipulating these ladder operators and using the commutation rules, it is possible to prove almost all of the quantization rules above.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"75%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! Click [show] on the right to see more details in the ladder-operator proof of the quantization rules<ref name=Griffithsladder/>\n|-\n| Before starting the main proof, we will note a useful fact: That <math>J_x^2, J_y^2, J_z^2</math> are [[positive-semidefinite matrix|positive-semidefinite operator]]s, meaning that all their eigenvalues are nonnegative. That also implies that the same is true for their sums, including <math>J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2</math> and <math>\\left(J^2 - J_z^2\\right) = \\left(J_x^2 + J_y^2\\right)</math>. The reason is that the square of ''any'' [[Hermitian operator]] is always positive semidefinite. (A Hermitian operator has real eigenvalues, so the squares of those eigenvalues are nonnegative.)\n\nAs above, assume that a state <math>| \\psi \\rangle</math> is a state in the simultaneous eigenbasis of <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z</math>. Its eigenvalue with respect to <math>J^2</math> can be written in the form <math>\\hbar^2 j (j + 1)</math> for some real number ''j'' > 0 (because as mentioned in the previous paragraph, <math>J^2</math> has nonnegative eigenvalues), and its eigenvalue with respect to <math>J_z</math> can be written <math>\\hbar m</math> for some real number ''m''. Instead of <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> we will use the more descriptive notation <math>|\\psi\\rangle = |j, m\\rangle</math>.\n\nNext, consider the sequence (\"ladder\") of states\n:<math>\\{\\ldots\\;,\\; J_- J_- |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_- |j, m\\rangle,\\; |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_+ |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_+ J_+ |j, m\\rangle,\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n\nSome entries in this infinite sequence may be the [[zero vector]] (as we will see). However, as described above, all the nonzero entries have the same value of <math>J^2</math>, and among the nonzero entries, each entry has a value of <math>J_z</math> which is exactly <math>\\hbar</math> more than the previous entry.\n\nIn this ladder, there can only be a finite number of nonzero entries, with infinite copies of the zero vector on the left and right. The reason is, as mentioned above, <math>(J^2 - J_z^2)</math> is positive-semidefinite, so if any quantum state is an eigenvector of both <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z^2</math>, the former eigenvalue is larger. The states in the ladder all have the same <math>J^2</math> eigenvalue, but going very far to the left or the right, the <math>J_z^2</math> eigenvalue gets larger and larger. The only possible resolution is, as mentioned, that there are only finitely many nonzero entries in the ladder.\n\nNow, consider the last nonzero entry to the right of the ladder, <math>|j,m_{max} \\rangle</math>. This state has the property that <math>J_+ |j,m_{max}\\rangle = 0</math>. As proven in the [[ladder operator]] article,\n:<math>J_+ |j, m\\rangle = \\hbar \\sqrt{j(j + 1) - m(m + 1)}|j, m + 1\\rangle</math>\n\nIf this is zero, then <math>j(j + 1) = m_\\text{max}\\left(m_\\text{max} + 1\\right)</math>, so <math>j = m</math> or <math>j = -m - 1</math>. However, because <math>J^2 - J_z^2</math> is positive-semidefinite, <math>\\hbar^2 j(j + 1) \\geq (\\hbar m)^2</math>, which means that the only possibility is <math>m_\\text{max} = j</math>.\n\nSimilarly, consider the first nonzero entry on the left of the ladder, <math>|j, m_\\text{min}\\rangle</math>. This state has the property that <math>J_- \\left|j, m_\\text{min}\\right\\rangle = 0</math>. As proven in the [[ladder operator]] article,\n:<math>J_- |j, m\\rangle = \\hbar \\sqrt{j(j + 1) - m(m - 1)} |j, m - 1\\rangle</math>\n\nAs above, the only possibility is that <math>m_\\text{min} = -j</math>\n\nSince ''m'' changes by 1 on each step of the ladder, <math>(j - (-j))</math> is an integer, so ''j'' is an integer or half-integer (0 or 0.5 or 1 or 1.5...).\n|}\n\nSince '''S''' and '''L''' have the same commutation relations as '''J''', the same ladder analysis works for them.\n\nThe ladder-operator analysis does '''''not''''' explain one aspect of the quantization rules above: the fact that '''L''' (unlike '''J''' and '''S''') cannot have half-integer quantum numbers. This fact can be proven (at least in the special case of one particle) by writing down every possible eigenfunction of ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>, (they are the [[spherical harmonic]]s), and seeing explicitly that none of them have half-integer quantum numbers.<ref>{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=1995 | pages=148\u2013153}}</ref> An alternative derivation is [[#SU(2), SO(3), and 360\u00b0 rotations|below]].\n\n===Visual interpretation===\n[[File:Vector model of orbital angular momentum.svg|250px|\"250px\"|right|thumb|Illustration of the vector model of orbital angular momentum.]]\n{{main|Vector model of the atom}}\nSince the angular momenta are quantum operators, they cannot be drawn as vectors like in classical mechanics. Nevertheless, it is common to depict them heuristically in this way. Depicted on the right is a set of states with quantum numbers <math>\\ell = 2</math>, and <math>m_\\ell = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2</math> for the five cones from bottom to top. Since <math>|L| = \\sqrt{L^2} = \\hbar \\sqrt{6}</math>, the vectors are all shown with length <math>\\hbar \\sqrt{6}</math>. The rings represent the fact that <math>L_z</math> is known with certainty, but <math>L_x</math> and  <math>L_y</math> are unknown; therefore every classical vector with the appropriate length and ''z''-component is drawn, forming a cone. The expected value of the angular momentum for a given ensemble of systems in the quantum state characterized by <math> \\ell</math> and <math>m_\\ell</math> could be somewhere on this cone while it cannot be defined for a single system (since the components of <math>L</math> do not commute with each other).\n\n===Quantization in macroscopic systems===\nThe quantization rules are technically true even for macroscopic systems, like the angular momentum '''L''' of a spinning tire. However they have no observable effect. For example, if <math>L_z/\\hbar</math> is roughly 100000000, it makes essentially no difference whether the precise value is an integer like 100000000 or 100000001, or a non-integer like 100000000.2\u2014the discrete steps are too small to notice.\n\n==Angular momentum as the generator of rotations==\n{{see also|Total angular momentum quantum number}}\nThe most general and fundamental definition of angular momentum is as the ''generator'' of rotations.<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|authorlink1=Robert Grayson Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, let <math>R(\\hat{n},\\phi)</math> be a [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]], which rotates any quantum state about axis <math>\\hat{n}</math> by angle <math>\\phi</math>.

The relationship between angular momentum operators and rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[Lie algebra]]s and [[Lie group]]s in mathematics, as discussed further below.\n\n[[File:RotationOperators.svg|thumb|300px|The different types of [[rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operators]].

The operator\n:<math>R_\\text{spatial}\\left(\\hat{n}, \\phi\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i \\phi L_\\hat{n}}{\\hbar}\\right),</math>\n\nrotates the position (in space) of all particles and fields, without rotating the internal (spin) state of any particle.

Instead, it is [[SU(2)]], which is identical to SO(3) for small rotations, but where a 360\u00b0 rotation is mathematically distinguished from a rotation of 0\u00b0. (A rotation of 720\u00b0 is, however, the same as a rotation of 0\u00b0.)<ref name=littlejohn/>\n\nOn the other hand, <math>R_\\text{spatial}\\left(\\hat{n}, 360^\\circ\\right) = +1</math> in all circumstances, because a 360\u00b0 rotation of a ''spatial'' configuration is the same as no rotation at all. (This is different from a 360\u00b0 rotation of the ''internal'' (spin) state of the particle, which might or might not be the same as no rotation at all.) In other words, the <math>R_\\text{spatial}</math> operators carry the structure of [[SO(3)]], while <math>R</math> and <math>R_\\text{internal}</math> carry the structure of [[SU(2)]].\n\nFrom the equation <math>+1 = R_\\text{spatial}\\left(\\hat{z}, 360^\\circ\\right) = \\exp\\left(-2\\pi i L_z / \\hbar\\right)</math>, one picks an eigenstate <math>L_z |\\psi\\rangle = m\\hbar |\\psi\\rangle</math> and draws\n:<math>e^{-2\\pi i m} = 1</math>\n\nwhich is to say that the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers can only be integers, not half-integers.\n\n===Connection to representation theory===\n{{main|Particle physics and representation theory|Representation theory of SU(2)|Rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra  }}\nStarting with a certain quantum state <math>|\\psi_0\\rangle</math>, consider the set of states <math>R\\left(\\hat{n}, \\phi\\right) \\left|\\psi_0\\right\\rangle</math> for all possible <math>\\hat{n}</math> and <math>\\phi</math>, i.e. the set of states that come about from rotating the starting state in every possible way. This is a [[vector space]], and therefore the manner in which the rotation operators map one state onto another is a [[group representation|''representation'']] of the group of rotation operators.\n:''When rotation operators act on quantum states, it forms a [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lie group]] [[SU(2)]] (for R and R<sub>internal</sub>), or [[SO(3)]] (for R<sub>spatial</sub>).''\n\nFrom the relation between '''J''' and rotation operators,\n:''When angular momentum operators act on quantum states, it forms a [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{su}(2)</math>  or <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math>.''\n\n(The Lie algebras of SU(2) and SO(3) are identical.)\n\nThe ladder operator derivation above is a method for classifying the representations of the Lie algebra SU(2).\n\n===Connection to commutation relations===\nClassical rotations do not commute with each other: For example, rotating 1\u00b0 about the ''x''-axis then 1\u00b0 about the ''y''-axis gives a slightly different overall rotation than rotating 1\u00b0 about the ''y''-axis then 1\u00b0 about the ''x''-axis. By carefully analyzing this noncommutativity, the commutation relations of the angular momentum operators can be derived.<ref name=littlejohn/>\n\n(This same calculational procedure is one way to answer the mathematical question \"What is the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]]s [[SO(3)]] or [[SU(2)]]?\")\n\n==Conservation of angular momentum==\nThe [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] ''H'' represents the energy and dynamics of the system. In a spherically-symmetric situation, the Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations:\n:<math>RHR^{-1} = H</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is a [[rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]]. As a consequence, <math>[H, R] = 0</math>, and then <math>[H,\\mathbf{J}]=\\mathbf 0</math> due to the relationship between '''J''' and ''R''. By the [[Ehrenfest theorem]], it follows that '''J''' is conserved.\n\nTo summarize, if ''H'' is rotationally-invariant (spherically symmetric), then total angular momentum '''J''' is conserved. This is an example of [[Noether's theorem]].\n\nIf ''H'' is just the Hamiltonian for one particle, the total angular momentum of that one particle is conserved when the particle is in a [[central potential]] (i.e., when the potential energy function depends only on <math>\\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|</math>). Alternatively, ''H'' may be the Hamiltonian of all particles and fields in the universe, and then ''H'' is ''always'' rotationally-invariant, as the fundamental laws of physics of the universe are the same regardless of orientation. This is the basis for saying [[conservation of angular momentum]] is a general principle of physics.\n\nFor a particle without spin, '''J''' = '''L''', so orbital angular momentum is conserved in the same circumstances. When the spin is nonzero, the [[spin-orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer from '''L''' to '''S''' or back. Therefore, '''L''' is not, on its own, conserved.\n\n==Angular momentum coupling==\n{{main|Angular momentum coupling|Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients}}\n\nOften, two or more sorts of angular momentum interact with each other, so that angular momentum can transfer from one to the other. For example, in [[spin-orbit coupling]], angular momentum can transfer between '''L''' and '''S''', but only the total '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S''' is conserved. In another example, in an atom with two electrons, each has its own angular momentum '''J'''<sub>1</sub> and '''J'''<sub>2</sub>, but only the total '''J''' = '''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub> is conserved.\n\nIn these situations, it is often useful to know the relationship between, on the one hand, states where <math>\\left(J_1\\right)_z, \\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)_z, \\left(J_2\\right)^2</math> all have definite values, and on the other hand, states where <math>\\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)^2, J^2, J_z</math> all have definite values, as the latter four are usually conserved (constants of motion). The procedure to go back and forth between these [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] is to use [[Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients]].\n\nOne important result in this field is that a relationship between the quantum numbers for <math>\\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)^2, J^2</math>:\n:<math>j \\in \\left\\{ \\left|j_1 - j_2\\right|, \\left(\\left|j_1 - j_2\\right| + 1\\right), \\ldots, \\left(j_1 + j_2\\right) \\right\\} </math>.\n\nFor an atom or molecule with '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S''', the [[term symbol]] gives the quantum numbers associated with the operators <math>L^2, S^2, J^2</math>.\n\n==Orbital angular momentum in spherical coordinates==\n\nAngular momentum operators usually occur when solving a problem with [[spherical symmetry]] in [[spherical coordinates]].

The angular momentum operator plays a central role in the theory of [[atomic physics]] and other quantum problems involving [[rotational symmetry]].  In both classical and quantum mechanical systems, angular momentum (together with [[linear momentum]] and [[energy]]) is one of the three fundamental properties of motion.<ref name=\"Liboff\">Introductory Quantum Mechanics, [[Richard L. Liboff]], 2nd Edition, {{ISBN|0-201-54715-5}}</ref>\n\nThere are several angular momentum operators: '''total angular momentum''' (usually denoted '''J'''), '''orbital angular momentum''' (usually denoted '''L'''), and '''spin angular momentum''' ('''spin''' for short, usually denoted '''S'''). The term ''angular momentum operator'' can (confusingly) refer to either the total or the orbital angular momentum. Total angular momentum is always [[conservation of angular momentum|conserved]], see [[Noether's theorem]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:LS coupling.svg|250px|thumb|\"Vector cones\" of total angular momentum '''J''' (purple), orbital '''L''' (blue), and spin '''S''' (green). The cones arise due to [[quantum uncertainty]] between measuring angular momentum components ([[#Visual interpretation|see below]]).]]\n\nIn quantum mechanics, angular momentum can refer to one of three different, but related things.\n\n===Orbital angular momentum===\nThe [[angular momentum|classical definition of angular momentum]] is <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{p}</math>. The quantum-mechanical counterparts of these objects share the same relationship:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{p}</math>\n\nwhere '''r''' is the quantum [[position operator]], '''p''' is the quantum [[momentum operator]], \u00d7 is [[cross product]], and '''L''' is the ''orbital angular momentum operator''. '''L''' (just like '''p''' and '''r''') is a ''vector operator'' (a vector whose components are operators), i.e. <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\left(L_x, L_y, L_z\\right)</math> where ''L''<sub>x</sub>, ''L''<sub>y</sub>, ''L''<sub>z</sub> are three different quantum-mechanical operators.\n\nIn the special case of a single particle with no [[electric charge]] and no [[spin (physics)|spin]], the orbital angular momentum operator can be written in the position basis as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = -i\\hbar(\\mathbf{r} \\times \\nabla)</math>\n\nwhere \u2207 is the vector differential operator, [[del]].\n\n===Spin angular momentum===\n{{main|Spin (physics)}}\nThere is another type of angular momentum, called [[spin (physics)|''spin angular momentum'']] (more often shortened to ''spin''), represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is only a metaphor: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space. All [[elementary particles]] have a characteristic spin, which is usually nonzero. For example, [[electron]]s always have \"spin 1/2\" while [[photon]]s always have \"spin 1\" (details [[#Quantization|below]]).\n\n===Total angular momentum===\nFinally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of a particle or system:\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{S}.</math>\n\n[[Conservation of angular momentum]] states that '''J''' for a closed system, or '''J''' for the whole universe, is conserved. However, '''L''' and '''S''' are ''not'' generally conserved. For example, the [[spin\u2013orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total '''J''' remaining constant.\n\n==Commutation relations==\n\n===Commutation relations between components===\nThe orbital angular momentum operator is a vector operator, meaning it can be written in terms of its vector components <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\left(L_x, L_y, L_z\\right)</math>. The components have the following [[commutation relation]]s with each other:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRsvmTFpB3wC&pg=PA171|title= Quantum Mechanics|first=G. |last=Aruldhas|page=171|chapter= formula (8.8)|isbn=978-81-203-1962-2|date=2004-02-01}}</ref>\n:<math>\\left[L_x, L_y\\right] = i\\hbar L_z, \\;\\; \\left[L_y, L_z\\right] = i\\hbar L_x, \\;\\; \\left[L_z, L_x\\right] = i\\hbar L_y,</math>\n\nwhere [&nbsp;,&nbsp;] denotes the [[commutator (ring theory)|commutator]]\n: <math>[X, Y] \\equiv XY - YX.</math>\n\nThis can be written generally as\n:<math>\\left[L_l, L_m\\right] = i \\hbar \\sum_{n=1}^{3} \\varepsilon_{lmn} L_n</math>,\n\nwhere ''l'', ''m'', ''n'' are the component indices (1 for ''x'', 2 for ''y'', 3 for ''z''), and ''\u03b5<sub>lmn</sub>'' denotes the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].\n\nA compact expression as one vector equation is also possible:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shankar|first1=R.|title=Principles of quantum mechanics|date=1994|publisher=Kluwer Academic / Plenum|location=New York|isbn=9780306447907|page=319|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{L} = i\\hbar \\mathbf{L}</math>\n\nThe commutation relations can be proved as a direct consequence of the [[canonical commutation relation]]s <math>[x_l,p_m]=i \\hbar \\delta_{lm}</math>, where ''\u03b4<sub>lm</sub>'' is the [[Kronecker delta]].\n\nThere is an analogous relationship in classical physics:<ref>H. Goldstein, C. P. Poole and J. Safko, ''Classical Mechanics, 3rd Edition'', Addison-Wesley 2002, pp. 388 ff.</ref>\n:<math>\\left\\{L_i, L_j\\right\\} = \\varepsilon_{ijk} L_k</math>\n\nwhere ''L''<sub>''n''</sub> is a component of the ''classical'' angular momentum operator, and <math>\\{ ,\\}</math> is the [[Poisson bracket]].\n\nThe same commutation relations apply for the other angular momentum operators (spin and total angular momentum):<ref name=littlejohn/>\n:<math>\\left[S_l, S_m\\right] = i \\hbar \\sum_{n=1}^{3} \\varepsilon_{lmn} S_n, \\quad \\left[J_l, J_m\\right] = i \\hbar \\sum_{n=1}^{3} \\varepsilon_{lmn} J_n</math>.\n\nThese can be ''assumed'' to hold in analogy with '''L'''. Alternatively, they can be ''derived'' as discussed [[#Connection to commutation relations|below]].\n\nThese commutation relations mean that '''L''' has the mathematical structure of a [[Lie algebra]], and the ''\u03b5<sub>lmn</sub>'' are its [[structure constant]]s. In this case, the Lie algebra is [[SU(2)#Lie algebra|SU(2)]] or [[SO(3)#Lie algebra|SO(3)]] in physics notation (<math>\\operatorname{su}(2)</math> or <math>\\operatorname{so}(3)</math> respectively in mathematics notation), i.e. Lie algebra associated with rotations in three dimensions. The same is true of '''J''' and '''S'''. The reason is discussed [[#Angular momentum as the generator of rotations|below]]. These commutation relations are relevant for measurement and uncertainty, as discussed further below.\n\n===Commutation relations involving vector magnitude===\nLike any vector, a [[Euclidean norm|magnitude]] can be defined for the orbital angular momentum operator,\n:<math>L^2 \\equiv L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2</math> .\n\n'''''L'''''<sup>2</sup> is another quantum [[operator (mathematics)|operator]].

Two complementary observables cannot be measured simultaneously; instead they satisfy an [[uncertainty principle]]. The more accurately one observable is known, the less accurately the other one can be known. Just as there is an uncertainty principle relating position and momentum, there are uncertainty principles for angular momentum.\n\nThe [[uncertainty principle|Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation]] gives the following uncertainty principle:\n:<math>\\sigma_{L_x} \\sigma_{L_y} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left| \\langle L_z \\rangle \\right|.</math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma_X</math> is the [[standard deviation]] in the measured values of ''X'' and <math>\\langle X \\rangle</math> denotes the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of ''X''. This inequality is also true if ''x, y, z'' are rearranged, or if ''L'' is replaced by ''J'' or ''S''.\n\nTherefore, two orthogonal components of angular momentum (for example L<sub>x</sub> and L<sub>y</sub>) are complementary and cannot be simultaneously known or measured, except in special cases such as <math>L_x = L_y = L_z = 0</math>.\n\nIt is, however, possible to simultaneously measure or specify ''L''<sup>2</sup> and any one component of ''L''; for example, ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>. This is often useful, and the values are characterized by the [[azimuthal quantum number]] (''l'') and the [[magnetic quantum number]] (''m''). In this case the quantum state of the system is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>, but ''not'' of ''L''<sub>x</sub> or ''L''<sub>y</sub>. The eigenvalues are related to ''l'' and ''m'', as shown in the table below.\n\n==Quantization==\n{{see also|Azimuthal quantum number|Magnetic quantum number}}\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is ''quantized'' \u2013 that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in \"quantum leaps\" between certain allowed values.

Then using the commutation relations, one can prove that <math>J_+ |\\psi\\rangle</math> and <math>J_-|\\psi\\rangle</math> are ''also'' in the simultaneous eigenbasis, with the same value of <math>J^2</math>, but where <math>J_z |\\psi\\rangle</math> is increased or decreased by <math>\\hbar</math>, respectively. (It is also possible that one or both of these result vectors is the zero vector.) (For a proof, see [[ladder operator#Angular momentum]].)\n\nBy manipulating these ladder operators and using the commutation rules, it is possible to prove almost all of the quantization rules above.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"75%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! Click [show] on the right to see more details in the ladder-operator proof of the quantization rules<ref name=Griffithsladder/>\n|-\n| Before starting the main proof, we will note a useful fact: That <math>J_x^2, J_y^2, J_z^2</math> are [[positive-semidefinite matrix|positive-semidefinite operator]]s, meaning that all their eigenvalues are nonnegative. That also implies that the same is true for their sums, including <math>J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2</math> and <math>\\left(J^2 - J_z^2\\right) = \\left(J_x^2 + J_y^2\\right)</math>. The reason is that the square of ''any'' [[Hermitian operator]] is always positive semidefinite. (A Hermitian operator has real eigenvalues, so the squares of those eigenvalues are nonnegative.)\n\nAs above, assume that a state <math>| \\psi \\rangle</math> is a state in the simultaneous eigenbasis of <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z</math>. Its eigenvalue with respect to <math>J^2</math> can be written in the form <math>\\hbar^2 j (j + 1)</math> for some real number ''j'' > 0 (because as mentioned in the previous paragraph, <math>J^2</math> has nonnegative eigenvalues), and its eigenvalue with respect to <math>J_z</math> can be written <math>\\hbar m</math> for some real number ''m''. Instead of <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> we will use the more descriptive notation <math>|\\psi\\rangle = |j, m\\rangle</math>.\n\nNext, consider the sequence (\"ladder\") of states\n:<math>\\{\\ldots\\;,\\; J_- J_- |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_- |j, m\\rangle,\\; |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_+ |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_+ J_+ |j, m\\rangle,\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n\nSome entries in this infinite sequence may be the [[zero vector]] (as we will see). However, as described above, all the nonzero entries have the same value of <math>J^2</math>, and among the nonzero entries, each entry has a value of <math>J_z</math> which is exactly <math>\\hbar</math> more than the previous entry.\n\nIn this ladder, there can only be a finite number of nonzero entries, with infinite copies of the zero vector on the left and right. The reason is, as mentioned above, <math>(J^2 - J_z^2)</math> is positive-semidefinite, so if any quantum state is an eigenvector of both <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z^2</math>, the former eigenvalue is larger. The states in the ladder all have the same <math>J^2</math> eigenvalue, but going very far to the left or the right, the <math>J_z^2</math> eigenvalue gets larger and larger. The only possible resolution is, as mentioned, that there are only finitely many nonzero entries in the ladder.\n\nNow, consider the last nonzero entry to the right of the ladder, <math>|j,m_{max} \\rangle</math>. This state has the property that <math>J_+ |j,m_{max}\\rangle = 0</math>. As proven in the [[ladder operator]] article,\n:<math>J_+ |j, m\\rangle = \\hbar \\sqrt{j(j + 1) - m(m + 1)}|j, m + 1\\rangle</math>\n\nIf this is zero, then <math>j(j + 1) = m_\\text{max}\\left(m_\\text{max} + 1\\right)</math>, so <math>j = m</math> or <math>j = -m - 1</math>. However, because <math>J^2 - J_z^2</math> is positive-semidefinite, <math>\\hbar^2 j(j + 1) \\geq (\\hbar m)^2</math>, which means that the only possibility is <math>m_\\text{max} = j</math>.\n\nSimilarly, consider the first nonzero entry on the left of the ladder, <math>|j, m_\\text{min}\\rangle</math>. This state has the property that <math>J_- \\left|j, m_\\text{min}\\right\\rangle = 0</math>. As proven in the [[ladder operator]] article,\n:<math>J_- |j, m\\rangle = \\hbar \\sqrt{j(j + 1) - m(m - 1)} |j, m - 1\\rangle</math>\n\nAs above, the only possibility is that <math>m_\\text{min} = -j</math>\n\nSince ''m'' changes by 1 on each step of the ladder, <math>(j - (-j))</math> is an integer, so ''j'' is an integer or half-integer (0 or 0.5 or 1 or 1.5...).\n|}\n\nSince '''S''' and '''L''' have the same commutation relations as '''J''', the same ladder analysis works for them.\n\nThe ladder-operator analysis does '''''not''''' explain one aspect of the quantization rules above: the fact that '''L''' (unlike '''J''' and '''S''') cannot have half-integer quantum numbers. This fact can be proven (at least in the special case of one particle) by writing down every possible eigenfunction of ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>, (they are the [[spherical harmonic]]s), and seeing explicitly that none of them have half-integer quantum numbers.<ref>{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=1995 | pages=148\u2013153}}</ref> An alternative derivation is [[#SU(2), SO(3), and 360\u00b0 rotations|below]].\n\n===Visual interpretation===\n[[File:Vector model of orbital angular momentum.svg|250px|\"250px\"|right|thumb|Illustration of the vector model of orbital angular momentum.]]\n{{main|Vector model of the atom}}\nSince the angular momenta are quantum operators, they cannot be drawn as vectors like in classical mechanics. Nevertheless, it is common to depict them heuristically in this way. Depicted on the right is a set of states with quantum numbers <math>\\ell = 2</math>, and <math>m_\\ell = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2</math> for the five cones from bottom to top. Since <math>|L| = \\sqrt{L^2} = \\hbar \\sqrt{6}</math>, the vectors are all shown with length <math>\\hbar \\sqrt{6}</math>. The rings represent the fact that <math>L_z</math> is known with certainty, but <math>L_x</math> and  <math>L_y</math> are unknown; therefore every classical vector with the appropriate length and ''z''-component is drawn, forming a cone. The expected value of the angular momentum for a given ensemble of systems in the quantum state characterized by <math> \\ell</math> and <math>m_\\ell</math> could be somewhere on this cone while it cannot be defined for a single system (since the components of <math>L</math> do not commute with each other).\n\n===Quantization in macroscopic systems===\nThe quantization rules are technically true even for macroscopic systems, like the angular momentum '''L''' of a spinning tire. However they have no observable effect. For example, if <math>L_z/\\hbar</math> is roughly 100000000, it makes essentially no difference whether the precise value is an integer like 100000000 or 100000001, or a non-integer like 100000000.2\u2014the discrete steps are too small to notice.\n\n==Angular momentum as the generator of rotations==\n{{see also|Total angular momentum quantum number}}\nThe most general and fundamental definition of angular momentum is as the ''generator'' of rotations.<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|authorlink1=Robert Grayson Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, let <math>R(\\hat{n},\\phi)</math> be a [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]], which rotates any quantum state about axis <math>\\hat{n}</math> by angle <math>\\phi</math>.

The relationship between angular momentum operators and rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[Lie algebra]]s and [[Lie group]]s in mathematics, as discussed further below.\n\n[[File:RotationOperators.svg|thumb|300px|The different types of [[rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operators]].

The operator\n:<math>R_\\text{spatial}\\left(\\hat{n}, \\phi\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i \\phi L_\\hat{n}}{\\hbar}\\right),</math>\n\nrotates the position (in space) of all particles and fields, without rotating the internal (spin) state of any particle.

Instead, it is [[SU(2)]], which is identical to SO(3) for small rotations, but where a 360\u00b0 rotation is mathematically distinguished from a rotation of 0\u00b0. (A rotation of 720\u00b0 is, however, the same as a rotation of 0\u00b0.)<ref name=littlejohn/>\n\nOn the other hand, <math>R_\\text{spatial}\\left(\\hat{n}, 360^\\circ\\right) = +1</math> in all circumstances, because a 360\u00b0 rotation of a ''spatial'' configuration is the same as no rotation at all. (This is different from a 360\u00b0 rotation of the ''internal'' (spin) state of the particle, which might or might not be the same as no rotation at all.) In other words, the <math>R_\\text{spatial}</math> operators carry the structure of [[SO(3)]], while <math>R</math> and <math>R_\\text{internal}</math> carry the structure of [[SU(2)]].\n\nFrom the equation <math>+1 = R_\\text{spatial}\\left(\\hat{z}, 360^\\circ\\right) = \\exp\\left(-2\\pi i L_z / \\hbar\\right)</math>, one picks an eigenstate <math>L_z |\\psi\\rangle = m\\hbar |\\psi\\rangle</math> and draws\n:<math>e^{-2\\pi i m} = 1</math>\n\nwhich is to say that the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers can only be integers, not half-integers.\n\n===Connection to representation theory===\n{{main|Particle physics and representation theory|Representation theory of SU(2)|Rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra  }}\nStarting with a certain quantum state <math>|\\psi_0\\rangle</math>, consider the set of states <math>R\\left(\\hat{n}, \\phi\\right) \\left|\\psi_0\\right\\rangle</math> for all possible <math>\\hat{n}</math> and <math>\\phi</math>, i.e. the set of states that come about from rotating the starting state in every possible way. This is a [[vector space]], and therefore the manner in which the rotation operators map one state onto another is a [[group representation|''representation'']] of the group of rotation operators.\n:''When rotation operators act on quantum states, it forms a [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lie group]] [[SU(2)]] (for R and R<sub>internal</sub>), or [[SO(3)]] (for R<sub>spatial</sub>).''\n\nFrom the relation between '''J''' and rotation operators,\n:''When angular momentum operators act on quantum states, it forms a [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{su}(2)</math>  or <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math>.''\n\n(The Lie algebras of SU(2) and SO(3) are identical.)\n\nThe ladder operator derivation above is a method for classifying the representations of the Lie algebra SU(2).\n\n===Connection to commutation relations===\nClassical rotations do not commute with each other: For example, rotating 1\u00b0 about the ''x''-axis then 1\u00b0 about the ''y''-axis gives a slightly different overall rotation than rotating 1\u00b0 about the ''y''-axis then 1\u00b0 about the ''x''-axis. By carefully analyzing this noncommutativity, the commutation relations of the angular momentum operators can be derived.<ref name=littlejohn/>\n\n(This same calculational procedure is one way to answer the mathematical question \"What is the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]]s [[SO(3)]] or [[SU(2)]]?\")\n\n==Conservation of angular momentum==\nThe [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] ''H'' represents the energy and dynamics of the system. In a spherically-symmetric situation, the Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations:\n:<math>RHR^{-1} = H</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is a [[rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]]. As a consequence, <math>[H, R] = 0</math>, and then <math>[H,\\mathbf{J}]=\\mathbf 0</math> due to the relationship between '''J''' and ''R''. By the [[Ehrenfest theorem]], it follows that '''J''' is conserved.\n\nTo summarize, if ''H'' is rotationally-invariant (spherically symmetric), then total angular momentum '''J''' is conserved. This is an example of [[Noether's theorem]].\n\nIf ''H'' is just the Hamiltonian for one particle, the total angular momentum of that one particle is conserved when the particle is in a [[central potential]] (i.e., when the potential energy function depends only on <math>\\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|</math>). Alternatively, ''H'' may be the Hamiltonian of all particles and fields in the universe, and then ''H'' is ''always'' rotationally-invariant, as the fundamental laws of physics of the universe are the same regardless of orientation. This is the basis for saying [[conservation of angular momentum]] is a general principle of physics.\n\nFor a particle without spin, '''J''' = '''L''', so orbital angular momentum is conserved in the same circumstances. When the spin is nonzero, the [[spin-orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer from '''L''' to '''S''' or back. Therefore, '''L''' is not, on its own, conserved.\n\n==Angular momentum coupling==\n{{main|Angular momentum coupling|Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients}}\n\nOften, two or more sorts of angular momentum interact with each other, so that angular momentum can transfer from one to the other. For example, in [[spin-orbit coupling]], angular momentum can transfer between '''L''' and '''S''', but only the total '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S''' is conserved. In another example, in an atom with two electrons, each has its own angular momentum '''J'''<sub>1</sub> and '''J'''<sub>2</sub>, but only the total '''J''' = '''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub> is conserved.\n\nIn these situations, it is often useful to know the relationship between, on the one hand, states where <math>\\left(J_1\\right)_z, \\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)_z, \\left(J_2\\right)^2</math> all have definite values, and on the other hand, states where <math>\\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)^2, J^2, J_z</math> all have definite values, as the latter four are usually conserved (constants of motion). The procedure to go back and forth between these [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] is to use [[Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients]].\n\nOne important result in this field is that a relationship between the quantum numbers for <math>\\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)^2, J^2</math>:\n:<math>j \\in \\left\\{ \\left|j_1 - j_2\\right|, \\left(\\left|j_1 - j_2\\right| + 1\\right), \\ldots, \\left(j_1 + j_2\\right) \\right\\} </math>.\n\nFor an atom or molecule with '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S''', the [[term symbol]] gives the quantum numbers associated with the operators <math>L^2, S^2, J^2</math>.\n\n==Orbital angular momentum in spherical coordinates==\n\nAngular momentum operators usually occur when solving a problem with [[spherical symmetry]] in [[spherical coordinates]].
