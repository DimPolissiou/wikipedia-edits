It is 70&nbsp;km away from the city of [[Gracias]], forced to pass by San Juan del Caite in [[Intibuca]].\n\n== History ==\nIts former name was \"Guaticaitique\", after that it was \"Santa Cruz de Guasabosque\". In the census of 1887 it was a village of [[Erandique]]. On 26 October 1926 it was granted the title of municipality in the administration of president [[Miguel Paz Barahona]].\n[[Image:Santa Cruz,Lempira 9.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Lenca Women with their offspring]]\n\n== Geography ==\nAs in the rest of the department, one cannot miss the high, steep mountains on their way to the municipality capital. Also on the road there are a couple of quarries, they provide material for the maintenance of the road. Rocks of different colours and hardnesses may be seen. It has a great amount of forest resources, but all around the municipality capital, less trees are seen. Pine forests are the most prevalent, but there is also a good amount of ''[[Liquidambar]]'' forest.\n\n== Boundaries ==\nIts boundaries are: \n*North : [[La Campa]] municipality.\n*South : [[Erandique]] and [[San Andr\u00e9s, Lempira|San Andr\u00e9s]] municipalities.\n*East  : [[Intibuca]] department.\n*West  : [[San Andr\u00e9s, Lempira|San Andr\u00e9s]] municipality.\n*'''Surface Extents''': 150&nbsp;km\u00b2\n\n== Resources ==\nThis is one of the poorest municipalities of the department. The coffee plantations are the main industry. Cattle raising, corn and beans crops follow but are mostly for local use. It has electricity and mobile communication services and water is sourced from wells. According to the elder inhabitants, close to the municipality capital there is a big deposit of several metals, but the owner of this property has no intention to exploit it and has rejected some millionaire offers from multi-nationals companies.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Population ==\nIn Santa Cruz, the direct descendants of the indigenous peoples make up 85% of the population. The remainder are of mixed ancestry.\n\n*'''Population''':For the year 2001 this municipality had 4,929 people, this figure was the base for an estimate, resulting in 7,089 people for the year of 2015.\n*'''Villages''': 6\n*'''Settlements''': 61\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe deviation for this municipality capital is not easy to see, it is approximately 20&nbsp;km away from San Juan del Caite, right across a football field. From the deviation to the capital the road is not in the best conditions. There is not much to see in the municipality capital. Perhaps for people who like to visit old colonial buildings, its church is a forced stop. Without doubt, the best feature of this municipality is its Liquidambar forest because their leaves change colours, depending on the season of the year. Also, it can be interesting to see the descendants of the Indians, since they still keep a lot of features of their ancestors.\n\n*'''Local Holidays''': \"Santa Cruz\" day on 3 May and \"San Francisco\" day on 4 October.\n[[Image:Santa Cruz,Lempira 8.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Spring Season in Santa Cruz forests]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717164424/http://www.santacruzlempira.unlugar.com/ Official website]\n{{commons|Santa Cruz, Lempira}}\n\n{{Lempira Department}}\n{{coord|14|1|N|88|23|W|source:itwiki_region:HN|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of the Lempira Department]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{Other uses|Santa Cruz (disambiguation){{!}}Santa Cruz}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name          = Santa Cruz\n|native_name            = Guaticaitique<!-- for cities whose native name is not in English -->\n|nickname               = \n|motto                  = \n|image_skyline          = Santa Cruz,Lempira.JPG\n|imagesize              = \n|image_caption          = Panoramic View of Santa Cruz\n|image_flag             = \n|image_seal             = \n|image_shield           = \n|image_map              = \n|mapsize                = \n|map_caption            = \n|pushpin_map            = Honduras<!-- the name of a location map as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Location_map -->\n|pushpin_label_position = right\n|pushpin_mapsize        = 300\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Honduras\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = Honduras\n|subdivision_type1      = Department\n|subdivision_name1      = Lempira\n|subdivision_type2      = \n|subdivision_name2      = \n|government_type        = \n|leader_title           = \n|leader_name            = \n|leader_title1          =  \n|leader_name1           = \n|leader_title2          =\n|leader_name2           =\n|leader_title3          =\n|leader_name3           = \n|established_title      = Municipality since\n|established_date       = {{start date and years ago|df=yes|1926|10|26}}\n|established_title2     = \n|established_date2      = \n|established_title3     = \n|established_date3      = \n|area_magnitude         = \n|area_total_km2         = 150\n|TotalArea_sq_km        = \n|area_land              = \n|LandArea_sq_mi         = \n|area_water             = \n|WaterArea_sq_mi        = \n|area_water_percent     =  \n|area_urban             = \n|UrbanArea_sq_mi        = \n|area_metro             = \n|MetroArea_sq_mi        = \n|population_as_of       = 2015\n|population_note        =\n|settlement_type        = Municipality<!--For Town or Village (Leave blank for the default City)--> \n|population_total       = 7089\n|population_density     = \n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_metro       = \n|population_density_metro_km2 = \n|population_density_metro_mi2 =\n|population_urban       = \n|timezone               = \n|utc_offset             = \n|timezone_DST           = \n|utc_offset_DST         = \n|coordinates            = {{coord|14|1|N|88|23|W|display=inline}}\n|elevation              = \n|elevation_ft           = \n|postal_code_type       =  <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n|postal_code            =\n|website                = {{official website|http://www.santacruzlempira.unlugar.com}}  \n|footnotes              = \n}}\n\n'''Santa Cruz''' ({{IPA-es|\u02c8santa \u02c8k\u027eus}}) is a municipality in the Honduran [[Departments of Honduras|department]] of [[Lempira department|Lempira]].\n\nIt is one of the most hidden municipalities of the [[Lempira Department|Lempira]] department.

{"title_page": "Thorndon Mile", "text_new": "{{More references|date=February 2011}}\nThe '''Thorndon Mile''' (formally '''George Adams (Tattersalls) Handicap''') is a [[Group One]] (G1) [[Thoroughbred]] horse race contested over 1,600 metres (one mile) and is held at [[Trentham Racecourse]], [[Wellington]], New Zealand. The race is run on [[Wellington Cup]] day, traditionally the last Saturday of January.\n\nThe purse for this race is [[NZD]]$200,000.\n\nThis race was known as the WRC George Adams Handicap until 1883. It was also known as the Jarden Mile or Jarden Morgan Mile while sponsored by that organisation over the 1984-1991 period. Later sponsors have included Hutt Valley Cartage.\n\nThe race has been won by many of the best horses in New Zealand, such as Kawi, Wall Street, [[Sir Slick]], Alamosa, McGinty and [[Grey Way]].\n\n==Winners of the Thorndon Mile==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|- \n! width=\"36px\" | '''Year'''<br>\n! width=\"120px\" | '''Winner'''<br>\n! width=\"130px\" | '''Jockey'''<br>\n!

The race is run on [[Wellington Cup]] day, traditionally the last Saturday of January.\n\nThe purse for this race is [[NZD]]$200,000.\n\nThis race was known as the WRC George Adams Handicap until 1883. It was also known as the Jarden Mile or Jarden Morgan Mile while sponsored by that organisation over the 1984-1991 period. Later sponsors have included Hutt Valley Cartage.\n\nThe race has been won by many of the best horses in New Zealand, such as Kawi, Wall Street, [[Sir Slick]], Alamosa, McGinty and [[Grey

He is a holder of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet Union's highest award.\n\n==Life and death==\nNikonov was born on 18 December 1920 into an ethnically Russian peasant family in the village of [[Vasilyevka, Stavropolsky District, Samara Oblast|Vasilyevka]] in what is now [[Stavropolsky District]] of [[Samara Oblast]].{{efn|name=Stavropol Region}} He joined the navy in 1939 and served as a torpedo electrician on the [[destroyer leader]] [[Leningrad-class destroyer|''Minsk'']] attached to the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]].\n\nFollowing the 1941 German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], Nikonov and many other Baltic Fleet sailors were deployed as emergency [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|naval infantry]].\n\nNikonov fought in the defense of [[Tallinn]] (5\u201328 August 1941), the main base of the Baltic Fleet. While engaged in reconnaissance near the town of [[Keila]] on 19 August he was seriously wounded and captured. Despite being tortured, Nikonov refused to give his captors any military information, for which the Germans doused him with gasoline and burned him alive.\n\nOn 19 April 1943 Baltic Fleet commander Vice\u2013Admiral [[Vladimir Tributs]] ordered that Torpedo Electrician Yevgeny Nikonov forever be listed as a member of the ''Minsk'''s active crew. (This tradition continues today; although the ''Minsk'' was long ago scrapped, Yevgeny Nikonov is always listed on the active personnel roster of a Baltic Fleet training unit.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltflot.vif20.ru/moriaki_geroi.html|title=\u041c\u043e\u0440\u044f\u043a\u0438-\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b, \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430|trans-title=Baltic Fleet sailors, entered forever onto the lists of ships and twice part of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet|author=Anna Ivanova|date=|work=The Baltic Fleet|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nNikonov was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on 3 September 1957.\n\n==Controversy==\nThere is no documented proof of whether the story behind Nikonov's death was true.

In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore; those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same time|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2020|date=20 February 2020}}</ref> In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is \"deeply disappointing\" and a \"betrayal of trust\", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tee |first1=Zhuo |title=Leak of closed-door Chan Chun Sing meeting 'deeply disappointing' and a 'betrayal', says Singapore Chinese Chamber president |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, [[The New York Times]] argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|title=As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-24|last2=Sang-Hun|first2=Choe|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sgwuhan.xose.net/ Interactive map of Singapore] \n* [https://corona.arrangy.com Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases] \u2013 Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.\n* [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation \u2013 Ministry of Health (Singapore)]\n* [https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html??cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna ChannelNewsAsia's COVID-19 clusters]\n* [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore The Straits Times article tracking every single case in Singapore]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "TheGreatSG'rean", "label": "safe", "comment": "Standardised timing notation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Singapore"}

They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the [[Christmas pyramid]], a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star.

On the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree was taken to the [[Town Hall Square, Tallinn|Town Hall Square]], where the members of the brotherhood danced around it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Amelung |title=Geschichte der Revaler Schwarzenh\u00e4upter: von ihrem Ursprung an bis auf die Gegenwart: nach den urkundenm\u00e4\u00dfigen Quellen des Revaler Schwarzenh\u00e4upter-Archivs 1, Die erste Bl\u00fctezeit von 1399\u20131557 |language=de|trans-title=History of the Tallinn Blackheads: from their origins until the present day: from the testimonial sources of the Tallinn Blackheads archive. 1: The first golden age of 1399\u20131557 |location=[[Tallinn|Reval]] |publisher=Wassermann |year=1885 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Bremen]] guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with \"apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers\" was erected in the guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas Day.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1jgAAAAMAAJ&q=%22aus+Deutschland%22|title=Das Weihnachtsfest.

The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. [[Glass]] baubles were first made in [[Lauscha]], [[Germany]], and also garlands of glass beads and [[tin]] figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled [[artisans]] with [[clay]] molds.\n\nTinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered [[saran (plastic)|saran]]-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a specialty of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]], especially in Lauscha in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.\nLighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom, fairy lights) is commonly done. A [[tree-topper]], sometimes an angel but more frequently a star, completes the decoration.\n\nIn the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s, [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] was very popular on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners.

Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]], [[Leyland cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|eastern juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]]); but spruces begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is faded. The long-needled [[Pinus strobus|eastern white pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]], some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Pinus radiata [[Pinus radiata|Monterey pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.\n\nSome trees, frequently referred to as \"living Christmas trees\", are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[plant nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |title=Living Christmas Trees |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |accessdate=12 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606222650/https://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |archive-date=6 June 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |title=Christmas tree |publisher=Department of Forestry, [[Michigan State University]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150004/http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nEuropean tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |title=BLM and Forest Service Christmas tree permits available |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=18 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114174843/http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |archive-date=14 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.\n\nIn the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s.

The main prop of a popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree hung with apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden. The Germans set up a paradise tree in their homes on December 24, the religious feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the [[Christmas pyramid]], a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star.

The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. [[Glass]] baubles were first made in [[Lauscha]], [[Germany]], and also garlands of glass beads and [[tin]] figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled [[artisans]] with [[clay]] molds.\n\nTinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered [[saran (plastic)|saran]]-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a specialty of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]], especially in Lauscha in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.\nLighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom, fairy lights) is commonly done. A [[tree-topper]], sometimes an angel but more frequently a star, completes the decoration.\n\nIn the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s, [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] was very popular on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Decorations\">\nFile:Boule de Noel.JPG|A transparent Christmas bauble\nFile:Christmas tree bauble.jpg|A golden [[Christmas ornament|bauble]] decorating a Christmas tree\nFile:Happy new year 06463.jpg|Christmas baubles\nFile:A baseball-shaped snowman decoration.jpg|A snowman-shaped decoration painted as a baseball\nFile:Christmas Tree Bear Decoration.png|A toy bear Christmas decoration.\nFile:Christmas baubles 08 - 01.JPG|[[Faberg\u00e9 egg]] as a Christmas decoration.\nFile:Christmas baubles 08 - 12.JPG|Christmas decorations\nFile:Christmas-bauble-on-gold-11289575412UeK.jpg|Red ornamented Christmas bauble\nFile:Christmas baubles 08 - 02.JPG|Christmas baubles\n</gallery>\n\n==Production==\n\n{{See also|Christmas tree production}}\n[[File:Christmas tree for sale.jpg|thumb|Undecorated Christmas trees for sale]]\n\nEach year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and 50 to 60 million are produced in Europe.

Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]], [[Leyland cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|eastern juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]]); but spruces begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is faded. The long-needled [[Pinus strobus|eastern white pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]], some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Pinus radiata [[Pinus radiata|Monterey pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.\n\nSome trees, frequently referred to as \"living Christmas trees\", are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[plant nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |title=Living Christmas Trees |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |accessdate=12 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606222650/https://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |archive-date=6 June 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |title=Christmas tree |publisher=Department of Forestry, [[Michigan State University]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150004/http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nEuropean tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |title=BLM and Forest Service Christmas tree permits available |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=18 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114174843/http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |archive-date=14 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.\n\nIn the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s.

This discrepancy was corrected in 1918, by the fledgling Bolshevik regime, but Christmas never reverted to December 25th in Russia, because the Bolsheviks began a systematic campaign to phase out traditional religious holidays and replace them with Soviet ones. Christmas was shifted to New Year's Eve.

The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.

They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]], (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejovi\u0107|1988|p=}}\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.
