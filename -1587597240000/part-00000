You will stay calm and face it.\" And further back, way back: my first-grade teacher writing FNORD on the blackboard, while a wheel with a spiral design turned and turned on his desk, turned and turned, and his voice droned on, IF YOU DON'T SEE THE FNORD IT CAN'T EAT YOU, DON'T SEE THE FNORD, DON'T SEE THE FNORD ...'</ref>  ''Illuminatus!'' was produced, in the United Kingdom, as a cycle of plays by anarchic theatre director [[Ken Campbell#Theatre director and playwright|Ken Campbell]] and his [[Jungian]] Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool. The plays further popularized the term.\n\nIn the novel trilogy (and the plays), the interjection \"fnord\" is given [[hypnotism|hypnotic power]] over the unenlightened. Under the [[Illuminati]] program, children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word \"fnord\". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion, preventing rational consideration of the text it appears in. The uneasiness and confusion create a perpetual low-level state of fear in the populace. The government acts on the premise that a fearful populace keeps them in power.\n\nIn the Shea/Wilson construct, fnords\u2014occurrences of the word \"fnord\"\u2014are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the advertisements, encouraging a [[consumerism|consumerist]] society. The exclusion of the text from rational consciousness also enables the Illuminati to publish messages to each other in newspapers, etc., without fear that other people will be aware of them. It is implied in the books that ''fnord'' is not the actual word used for this task, but merely a substitute, since most readers would be unable to see the actual word.\n\nTo \"see the fnords\" means to be unaffected by the supposed hypnotic power of the word or, more loosely, of other [[fighting words]]. The term may also be used to refer to the experience of becoming aware of a phenomenon's ubiquity after first observing it.  The phrase \"I have seen the fnords\" was graffitied on a British railway bridge throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until the bridge was upgraded. The bridge, located between Earlsdon and Coventry city centre, is known locally as \"Anarchy Bridge\". The bridge and the phrase were mentioned in the novel ''A Touch of Love'' by [[Jonathan Coe]].\n\n==Use in Geekdom==\nThe lack of a clear definition of the word, and its popularity among certain groups on the internet, allowed it to be appropriated as a [[Placeholder name|placeholder word]] (a [[metasyntactic variable]]) in computer programming,<ref name=Bautts/><ref name=\"Deckard2005\">{{cite book|author=Jason Deckard |title=Buffer Overflow Attacks: Detect, Exploit, Prevent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYyKhOqOCF8C&pg=PA283 |date=29 January 2005 |publisher=Syngress |isbn=978-0-08-048842-4 |page=283}}</ref> particularly by those with ties to [[Discordianism]] or the [[Church of the SubGenius]].<ref name=Ray/> It has also been found useful as the name for a \"techno cultural\" conference,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowafest.com/2014/02/fnord-2014-northern-india-engineering-college-techno-cultural-festival-delhi.html |title=FNORD 2014, Northern India Engineering College, Delhi, Techno Cultural Festival, Delhi, March 5-7 2014 |publisher=Knowafest.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> computer programs,<ref name=\"Raucci1997\">{{cite book|author=Richard Raucci |title=A Windows NTTM Guide to the Web: Covering Browsers, Servers, and Related Software |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5f3mlM-JKUAC&pg=PA50 |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-387-94792-1 |page=50}}</ref> and as a general placeholder word in computing literature.<ref name=\"Linnhoff-PopienHegering2000\">{{cite book|author1=[[Claudia Linnhoff-Popien]] |author2=Heinz-Gerd Hegering |title=Trends in Distributed Systems: Towards a Universal Service Market: Third International IFIP/GI Working Conference, USM 2000 Munich, Germany, September 12-14, 2000 Proceedings |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-10722515 |date=1 September 2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-41024-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-10722515/page/n71 62]}}</ref>\n\n==Use in Open Source Web Servers==\nFnord! is the name of a (now defunct) freeware NT web server created by Brian Morin in 1995 and transferred to the care of Stephen Kazmierczak in 1997 when Brian was initiated into the summer Internet Server group at Microsoft.

The bridge and the phrase were mentioned in the novel ''A Touch of Love'' by [[Jonathan Coe]].\n\n==Use in Geekdom==\nThe lack of a clear definition of the word, and its popularity among certain groups on the internet, allowed it to be appropriated as a [[Placeholder name|placeholder word]] (a [[metasyntactic variable]]) in computer programming,<ref name=Bautts/><ref name=\"Deckard2005\">{{cite book|author=Jason Deckard |title=Buffer Overflow Attacks: Detect, Exploit, Prevent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYyKhOqOCF8C&pg=PA283 |date=29 January 2005 |publisher=Syngress |isbn=978-0-08-048842-4 |page=283}}</ref> particularly by those with ties to [[Discordianism]] or the [[Church of the SubGenius]].<ref name=Ray/> It has also been found useful as the name for a \"techno cultural\" conference,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowafest.com/2014/02/fnord-2014-northern-india-engineering-college-techno-cultural-festival-delhi.html |title=FNORD 2014, Northern India Engineering College, Delhi, Techno Cultural Festival, Delhi, March 5-7 2014 |publisher=Knowafest.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> computer programs,<ref name=\"Raucci1997\">{{cite book|author=Richard Raucci |title=A Windows NTTM Guide to the Web: Covering Browsers, Servers, and Related Software |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5f3mlM-JKUAC&pg=PA50 |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-387-94792-1 |page=50}}</ref> and as a general placeholder word in computing literature.<ref name=\"Linnhoff-PopienHegering2000\">{{cite book|author1=[[Claudia Linnhoff-Popien]] |author2=Heinz-Gerd Hegering |title=Trends in Distributed Systems: Towards a Universal Service Market: Third International IFIP/GI Working Conference, USM 2000 Munich, Germany, September 12-14, 2000 Proceedings |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-10722515 |date=1 September 2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-41024-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-10722515/page/n71 62]}}</ref>\n\n==Use in Open Source Web Servers==\nFnord! is the name of a (now defunct) freeware NT web server created by Brian Morin in 1995 and transferred to the care of Stephen Kazmierczak in 1997 when Brian was initiated into the summer Internet Server group at Microsoft.

As implemented by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]'s procurement regulations,<ref>see ASPR, 32 CFR \u00a7 17.000 et seq.; AECPR, 41 CFR \u00a7 9\u201417.000 et seq.,</ref> the authority conferred encompasses amendments without consideration, correction of mutual mistakes, and formalization of informal commitments. This authority, which in many respects is analogous to power to settle claims, is delegated to Contract Adjustment Boards established within the departments and agencies concerned separate from the Boards of Contract Appeals. Because the regulations preclude resort to the powers conferred by Public Law 85\u2014804, \"unless other legal authority in the Department concerned is deemed to be lacking or inadequate\",<ref>ASPR, 32 CFR \u00a7 17.205\u20141(b)(2)</ref> the Army Contract Adjustment Board has generally required contractors to exhaust remedies before the ASBCA under the disputes clause.<ref>Blaw-Knox Co., ACAB Dkt.

He previously was [[speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] (1835\u20131839) and [[List of Governors of Tennessee|governor of Tennessee]] (1839\u20131841). A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Andrew Jackson]], he was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and an advocate of [[Jacksonian democracy]]. Polk is chiefly known for extending the territory of the United States during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]; during his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the [[annexation of Texas|annexation]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Oregon Territory]], and the [[Mexican Cession]] following the American victory in the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\nAfter building a successful law practice in [[Tennessee]], Polk was elected to the state legislature (1823) and then to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1825, becoming a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson. After serving as chairman of the [[Ways and Means Committee]], he became Speaker in 1835, the only president to have been Speaker. Polk left Congress to run for [[governor of Tennessee]]; he won in 1839, but lost in 1841 and 1843. He was a [[dark horse]] candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]]; he entered his party's convention as a potential nominee for vice president, but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could secure the necessary two-thirds majority. In the general election, Polk defeated [[Henry Clay]] of the rival [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nHistorians have praised Polk for having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set. After a negotiation fraught with risk of war, he reached a settlement with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] over the [[Oregon boundary dispute|disputed]] [[Oregon Country]], the territory for the most part being divided along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican\u2013American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly all the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. He secured a substantial reduction of [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]] rates with the [[Walker tariff]] of 1846. The same year, he achieved his other major goal, re-establishment of the [[Independent Treasury]] system. Historian [[Thomas A. Bailey]] says that during the Mexican war, \"Polk was an energetic and indefatigable war leader, and he emerged, partly through rare good luck, with uninterrupted success. He kept the sole direction of the war in his own hands, from grand strategy to the procurement of mules.\"<ref>Thomas A. Bailey, ''Presidential greatness: The image and the man from George Washington to the present'' (1966) pp 224-25.</ref>  True to his campaign pledge to serve only one term, Polk left office in 1849 and returned to Tennessee where he died three months after leaving the White House.\n\nThough he is relatively obscure today, scholars have [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|ranked]] Polk favorably for his ability to promote and achieve the major items on his presidential agenda. However, he has also been criticized for leading the country into an unnecessary war against Mexico and for exacerbating sectional divides. A slaveholder for most of his adult life, he owned a plantation in Mississippi and bought slaves while president. A major legacy of Polk's presidency is territorial expansion, as the United States reached the Pacific coast and became poised to be a world power. However, sectional divisions in the U.S. were exacerbated by the territorial expansion and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] is considered a direct consequence of Polk's policy.\n\n==Early life==\n{{further|President James K.

While Polk's mother remained a devout Presbyterian, his father, whose own father [[Ezekiel Polk]] was a [[deism|deist]], rejected dogmatic Presbyterianism. He refused to declare his belief in Christianity at his son's baptism, and the minister refused to baptize young James.<ref name=\"Borneman6\"/><ref name=haynes2>Haynes, pp. 4\u20136.</ref> Nevertheless, James' mother \"stamped her rigid orthodoxy on James, instilling lifelong Calvinistic traits of self-discipline, hard work, piety, individualism, and a belief in the imperfection of human nature\", according to [[James A.

His father took him to see prominent Philadelphia physician Dr. [[Philip Syng Physick]] for urinary stones. The journey was broken off by James's severe pain, and Dr. [[Ephraim McDowell]] of [[Danville, Kentucky]], operated to remove them. No anesthetic was available except brandy. The operation was successful, but it might have left James impotent or sterile, as he had no children. He recovered quickly, and became more robust.

The Polk family had connections with the university, then a small school of about 80 students; Samuel was its land agent in Tennessee and his cousin [[William Polk (colonel)|William Polk]] was a trustee.<ref>Haynes, p. 11</ref> Polk's roommate was [[William Dunn Moseley]], who became the first Governor of Florida.

When the [[Tennessee Legislature]] deadlocked on whom to elect as U.S. senator in 1823 (until 1913, legislators, not the people, elected senators), Jackson's name was placed in nomination. Polk broke from his usual allies, casting his vote as a member of the state House of Representatives for the general in Jackson's victory. This boosted Jackson's presidential chances by giving him recent political experience{{efn|Jackson had served in both houses of Congress in the 1790s.}} to match his military accomplishments.

Polk, like other Jackson supporters, believed that Speaker of the House [[Henry Clay]] had traded his support as fourth-place finisher (the House may only choose from among the top three) to Adams in a [[Corrupt bargain#Election of 1824|Corrupt Bargain]] in exchange for being the new Secretary of State. Polk had in August 1824 declared his candidacy for the following year's election to the House of Representatives from [[Tennessee's 6th congressional district]].<ref name=\"Borneman23\">Borneman, p. 23</ref> The district stretched from Maury County south to the Alabama line, and extensive electioneering was expected of the five candidates. Polk campaigned so vigorously that Sarah began to worry about his health.

Polk made his first major speech on March 13, 1826, in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and that the president should be elected by popular vote.<ref name=\"Borneman24\">Borneman, p. 24</ref> Remaining bitter at the alleged Corrupt Bargain between Adams and Clay, Polk became a vocal critic of the [[presidency of John Quincy Adams|administration]], frequently voting against its policies.<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 38\u201339</ref> Sarah Polk remained at home in Columbia during her husband's first year in Congress, but accompanied him to Washington beginning in December 1826; she assisted him with his correspondence, and came to hear James's speeches.<ref name=\"Borneman26\" />\n\nPolk won re-election in 1827 and continued to oppose the Adams administration.<ref name=\"Borneman26\">Borneman, p. 26</ref> He remained in close touch with Jackson, and when Jackson ran for president in [[1828 United States presidential election|1828]], Polk was a corresponding advisor on his campaign. Following Jackson's victory over Adams, Polk became one of the new President's most prominent and loyal supporters in the House.<ref>Merry, pp. 30, 39\u201340</ref> Working on Jackson's behalf, Polk successfully opposed federally-funded \"[[internal improvements]]\" such as a proposed Buffalo-to-New Orleans road, and he was pleased by Jackson's [[Maysville Road veto]] in May 1830, when Jackson blocked a bill to finance a road extension entirely within one state, Kentucky, deeming it unconstitutional.<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Jackson opponents alleged that the veto message, which strongly complained about Congress' penchant for passing [[pork barrel]] projects, was written by Polk, but he denied this, stating that the message was entirely the President's.<ref>Seigenthaler, p. 46</ref>\n\nPolk served as Jackson's most prominent House ally in the \"[[Bank War]]\" that developed over Jackson's opposition to the re-authorization of the [[Second Bank of the United States]].<ref name=Merry4243>Merry, pp. 42\u201343</ref> The Second Bank, headed by [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] of Philadelphia, not only held federal dollars, but controlled much of the credit in the United States, as it could present currency issued by local banks for redemption in gold or silver. Some Westerners, including Jackson, opposed the Second Bank, deeming it a monopoly acting in the interest of Easterners.<ref>Borneman, pp. 28\u201329</ref> Polk, as a member of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]], conducted investigations of the Second Bank, and though the committee voted for a bill to renew the bank's charter (scheduled to expire in 1836), Polk issued a strong minority report condemning the bank. The bill passed Congress in 1832, but Jackson vetoed it and Congress failed to override the veto. Jackson's action was highly controversial in Washington, but had considerable public support, and he [[1832 United States presidential election|won easy re-election in 1832]].<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 48\u201352</ref>\n\nLike many Southerners, Polk favored low tariffs on imported goods, and initially sympathized with [[John C. Calhoun]]'s opposition to the [[Tariff of Abominations]] during the [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1832\u20131833, but came over to Jackson's side as Calhoun moved towards advocating secession. Thereafter, Polk remained loyal to Jackson as the President sought to assert federal authority. Polk condemned secession and supported the [[Force Bill]] against South Carolina, which had claimed the authority to nullify federal tariffs. The matter was settled by Congress passing a [[Tariff of 1833|compromise tariff]].<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\n===Ways and Means chair and Speaker of the House===\nIn December 1833, after being elected to a fifth consecutive term, Polk, with Jackson's backing, became the chairman of Ways and Means, a powerful position in the House.<ref name=\"Borneman33\">Borneman, p. 33</ref> In that position, Polk supported Jackson's withdrawal of federal funds from the Second Bank. Polk's committee issued a report questioning the Second Bank's finances, and another supporting Jackson's actions against it. In April 1834, the Ways and Means Committee reported a bill to regulate state deposit banks, which, when passed, enabled Jackson to deposit funds in [[pet banks]], and Polk got legislation passed to allow the sale of the government's stock in the Second Bank.<ref name= \"a\" /><ref>Merry, p. 42</ref>\n\nIn June 1834, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Andrew Stevenson]] resigned from Congress to become [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Borneman34\">Borneman, p. 34</ref> With Jackson's support, Polk ran for Speaker against fellow Tennessean [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], Calhoun disciple [[Richard Henry Wilde]], and [[Joel Barlow Sutherland]] of Pennsylvania.

Polk appointed committees with Democratic chairs and majorities, including the New York radical [[Churchill C. Cambreleng|C. C. Cambreleng]] as the new Ways and Means chair, although he tried to maintain the Speaker's traditional nonpartisan appearance. The two major issues during Polk's speakership were slavery and, after the [[Panic of 1837]], the economy. Polk firmly enforced the \"[[gag rule]]\", by which the House of Representatives would not accept or debate citizen petitions regarding slavery.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler5760\">Seigenthaler, pp. 57\u201361</ref> This ignited fierce protests from John Quincy Adams, who was by then a congressman from Massachusetts and an abolitionist. Instead of finding a way to silence Adams, Polk frequently engaged in useless shouting matches, leading Jackson to conclude that the Speaker should have shown better leadership.<ref>Remini, p. 406</ref> Van Buren and Polk faced pressure to rescind the [[Specie Circular]], Jackson's 1836 order that payment for government lands be in gold and silver. Some believed this had led to the crash by causing a lack of confidence in paper currency issued by banks. Despite such arguments, with support from Polk and his cabinet, Van Buren chose to back the Specie Circular. Polk and Van Buren attempted to establish an Independent Treasury system that would allow the government to oversee its own deposits (rather than using pet banks), but the bill was defeated in the House.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler5760\"/> It eventually passed in 1840.<ref>Bergeron, p. 1</ref>\n\nUsing his thorough grasp of the House's rules,<ref>Bergeron, p. 12</ref> Polk attempted to bring greater order to its proceedings. Unlike many of his peers, he never challenged anyone to a duel no matter how much they insulted his honor.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler62\">Seigenthaler, p. 62</ref> The economic downturn cost the Democrats seats, so that when he faced re-election as Speaker in December 1837, he won by only 13 votes, and he foresaw defeat in 1839. Polk by then had presidential ambitions, but was well aware that no Speaker had ever become president (Polk is still the only one to have held both offices).<ref>Borneman, p. 38</ref> After seven terms in the House, two as Speaker, he announced that he would not seek re-election, choosing instead to run for Governor of Tennessee in the 1839 election.<ref>Merry, pp. 45\u201346</ref>\n\n===Governor of Tennessee===\nIn 1835, the Democrats had lost the governorship of Tennessee for the first time in their history, and Polk decided to return home to help the party.<ref>Seigenthaler, p. 64</ref> Polk returned to a Tennessee afire for White and Whiggism; the state had changed greatly in its political loyalties since the days of Jacksonian domination. Polk undertook his first statewide campaign, against the Whig incumbent, [[Newton Cannon]], who sought a third two-year term as governor.<ref>Bergeron, p. 13</ref> The fact that Polk was the one called upon to \"redeem\" Tennessee from the Whigs tacitly acknowledged him as head of the state Democratic Party.<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nPolk campaigned on national issues, whereas Cannon stressed matters local to Tennessee. After being bested by Polk in the early debates, the governor retreated to Nashville, by then the state capital, alleging important official business. Polk made speeches across the state, seeking to become known more widely than in his native [[Middle Tennessee]]. When Cannon came back on the campaign trail in the final days, Polk pursued him, hastening the length of the state to be able to debate the governor again. On Election Day, August 1, 1839, Polk defeated Cannon, 54,102 to 51,396, as the Democrats recaptured the state legislature and won back three congressional seats in Tennessee.<ref>Borneman, pp. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nTennessee's governor had limited power\u2014there was no gubernatorial veto, and the small size of the state government limited any political patronage. But Polk saw the office as a springboard for his national ambitions, seeking to be nominated as Van Buren's vice presidential running mate at the [[1840 Democratic National Convention]] in Baltimore in May.<ref>Borneman, p. 43</ref> Polk hoped to be the replacement if Vice President [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] was dumped from the ticket; Johnson was disliked by many Southern whites for fathering two daughters by a biracial mistress, and attempting to introduce them into white society. Johnson was from Kentucky, so Polk's Tennessee residence would keep the New Yorker Van Buren's ticket balanced. The convention chose to endorse no one for vice president, stating that a choice would be made once the popular vote was cast. Three weeks after the convention, recognizing that Johnson was too popular in the party to be ousted, Polk withdrew his name. The Whig presidential candidate, General [[William Henry Harrison]], conducted [[William Henry Harrison presidential campaign, 1840|a rollicking campaign]] with the motto \"[[Tippecanoe and Tyler Too]]\", easily winning both the national vote and that in Tennessee. Polk campaigned in vain for Van Buren<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 32\">Leonard, p. 32</ref> and was embarrassed by the outcome; Jackson, who had returned to his home, [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|the Hermitage]], near Nashville, was horrified at the prospect of a Whig administration. Harrison's death after a month in office in 1841 left the presidency to Vice President [[John Tyler]], who soon broke with the Whigs.<ref>Borneman, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nPolk's three major programs during his governorship; regulating state banks, implementing state internal improvements, and improving education all failed to win the approval of the legislature.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler66\">Seigenthaler, p. 66</ref> His only major success as governor was his politicking to secure the replacement of Tennessee's two Whig U.S. senators with Democrats.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler66\"/> Polk's tenure was hindered by the continuing nationwide economic crisis that had followed the Panic of 1837 and which had caused Van Buren to lose the [[1840 U.S. presidential election|1840 election]].<ref>Merry, p. 47</ref>\n\nEncouraged by the success of Harrison's campaign, the Whigs ran a freshman legislator from frontier [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], [[James C. Jones]] against Polk in 1841. \"Lean Jimmy\" had proven one of their most effective gadflies against Polk, and his lighthearted tone at campaign debates was very effective against the serious Polk. The two debated the length of Tennessee,<ref>Bergeron, p. 14</ref> and Jones's support of distribution to the states of surplus federal revenues, and of a national bank, struck a chord with Tennessee voters. On election day in August 1841, Polk was defeated by 3,000 votes, the first time he had been beaten at the polls.<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 32\"/> Polk returned to Columbia and the practice of law, and prepared for a rematch against Jones in 1843, but though the new governor took less of a joking tone, it made little difference to the outcome, as Polk was beaten again,<ref>Bergeron, pp. 18\u201319</ref> this time by 3,833 votes.<ref name= \"Borneman p.64\">Borneman, p. 64</ref><ref name=\"Seigenthaler68\">Seigenthaler, p. 68</ref> In the wake of his second statewide defeat in three years, Polk faced an uncertain political future.<ref name=Merry4749>Merry, pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\n==Election of 1844==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1844}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\nDespite his loss, Polk was determined to become the next [[vice president of the United States]], seeing it as a path to the presidency.<ref name=\"Merry p. 43-44\">Merry, pp. 43\u201344</ref> Van Buren was the frontrunner for the [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] Democratic nomination, and Polk engaged in a careful campaign to become his running mate.<ref name=Merry5053>Merry, pp. 50\u201353</ref> The former president faced opposition from Southerners who feared his views on slavery, while his handling of the Panic of 1837\u2014he had refused to rescind the Specie Circular\u2014aroused opposition from some in the West (today's Midwest) who believed his hard money policies had hurt their section of the country.<ref name=Merry5053/> Many Southerners backed Calhoun's candidacy, Westerners rallied around Senator [[Lewis Cass]] of Michigan, and former Vice President Johnson also maintained a strong following among Democrats.<ref name=Merry5053/> Jackson assured Van Buren by letter that Polk in his campaigns for governor had \"fought the battle well and fought it alone\".<ref>Borneman, p. 51</ref> Polk hoped to gain Van Buren's support, hinting in a letter that a Van Buren/Polk ticket could carry Tennessee, but found him unconvinced.<ref>Borneman, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe biggest political issue in the United States at that time was territorial expansion.<ref name = \"a\" /> The [[Republic of Texas]] had [[Texas Revolution|successfully revolted]] against Mexico in 1836. With the republic largely populated by American emigres, those on both sides of the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]] border between the U.S. and Texas deemed it inevitable that Texas would join the United States, but this would anger Mexico, which considered Texas a breakaway province, and threatened war if the United States annexed it.

Polk was one of the few major Democrats to have declared for the annexation of Texas.<ref>Borneman, pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n\nThe convention opened on May 27, 1844. A crucial question was whether the nominee needed two-thirds of the delegate vote, as had been the case at previous Democratic conventions, or merely a majority. A vote for two-thirds would doom Van Buren's candidacy due to the opposition to him.<ref>Merry, pp. 84\u201385</ref> With the support of the Southern states, the two-thirds rule was passed.<ref name=Merry8788>Merry, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Van Buren won a majority on the first presidential ballot, but failed to win the necessary two-thirds, and his support slowly faded on subsequent ballots.<ref name=Merry8788/> Cass, Johnson, Calhoun and [[James Buchanan]] had also received votes on the first ballot, and Cass took the lead on the fifth ballot.<ref>Merry, p. 89</ref> After seven ballots, the convention remained deadlocked: Cass could not attract the support necessary to reach two-thirds, and Van Buren's supporters were more and more discouraged about the former president's chances. Delegates were ready to consider a new candidate who might break the stalemate.<ref>Bergeron, p. 16</ref>\n\nWhen the convention adjourned after the seventh ballot, Pillow, who had been waiting for an opportunity to press Polk's name, conferred with [[George Bancroft]] of Massachusetts, a politician and historian who was a longtime Polk correspondent, and who had planned to nominate Polk for vice president. Bancroft had supported Van Buren's candidacy, and was willing to see New York Senator [[Silas Wright]] head the ticket, but Wright would not consider taking a nomination that Van Buren wanted. Pillow and Bancroft decided if Polk were nominated for president, Wright might accept the second spot. Before the eighth ballot, former Attorney General [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)|Benjamin F. Butler]], head of the New York delegation, read a pre-written letter from Van Buren to be used if he could not be nominated, withdrawing in Wright's favor. But Wright (who was in Washington) had also entrusted a pre-written letter to a supporter, in which he refused to be considered as a presidential candidate, and stated in the letter that he agreed with Van Buren's position on Texas. Had Wright's letter not been read he most likely would have been nominated, but without him, Butler began to rally Van Buren supporters for Polk as the best possible candidate, and Bancroft placed Polk's name before the convention. On the eighth ballot, Polk received only 44 votes to Cass's 114 and Van Buren's 104, but the deadlock showed signs of breaking. Butler formally withdrew Van Buren's name, many delegations declared for the Tennessean, and on the ninth ballot Polk received 233 ballots to Cass's 29, making him the Democratic nominee for president. The nomination was then made unanimous.<ref name = \"a\"/><ref>Borneman, pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\nThis left the question of the vice presidential candidate. Butler urged Wright's nomination, and the convention agreed to this, with only eight Georgia delegates dissenting. As the convention waited, word of Wright's nomination was sent to him in Washington via [[telegraph]]. Having by proxy declined an almost certain presidential nomination, Wright would not accept the second place. Senator [[Robert J. Walker]] of Mississippi, a close Polk ally, suggested former senator [[George M. Dallas]] of Pennsylvania. Dallas was acceptable enough to all factions, and gained the vice presidential nomination on the second ballot. The delegates passed a platform, and adjourned on May 30.<ref>Borneman, pp. 104\u2013108</ref><ref>Merry, pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nAlthough many contemporary politicians, including Pillow and Bancroft, claimed credit in the years to come for getting Polk the nomination, [[Walter R. Borneman]] felt that most credit was due to Jackson and Polk, \"the two who had done the most were back in Tennessee, one an aging icon ensconced at the Hermitage and the other a shrewd lifelong politician waiting expectantly in Columbia\".<ref>Borneman, p. 108</ref> Whigs mocked Polk with the chant \"Who is James K.

The dispatches were sent on to Columbia, arriving the same day, and letters and newspapers describing what had happened at Baltimore were in Polk's hands by June 6. He accepted his nomination by letter dated June 12, alleging that he had never sought the office, and stating his intent to serve only one term.<ref>Borneman, pp. 111\u2013114</ref> Wright was embittered by what he called the \"foul plot\" against Van Buren, and demanded assurances that Polk had played no part; it was only after Polk professed that he had remained loyal to Van Buren that Wright supported his campaign.<ref>Eisenhower, p. 81</ref> Following the custom of the time that presidential candidates avoid electioneering or appearing to seek the office, Polk remained in Columbia and made no speeches. He engaged in an extensive correspondence with Democratic Party officials as he managed his campaign. Polk made his views known in his acceptance letter and through responses to questions sent by citizens that were printed in newspapers, often by arrangement.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 17\u201319</ref><ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nA potential pitfall for Polk's campaign was the issue of whether the tariff should be for revenue only, or with the intent to protect American industry. Polk finessed the tariff issue in a published letter. Recalling that he had long stated that tariffs should only be sufficient to finance government operations, he maintained that stance, but wrote that within that limitation, government could and should offer \"fair and just protection\" to American interests, including manufacturers.<ref>Merry, pp. 97\u201399</ref> He refused to expand on this stance, acceptable to most Democrats, despite the Whigs pointing out that he had committed himself to nothing. In September, a delegation of Whigs from nearby [[Giles County, Tennessee|Giles County]] came to Columbia, armed with specific questions on Polk's views regarding the current tariff, the Whig-passed [[Tariff of 1842]], and with the stated intent of remaining in Columbia until they got answers. Polk took several days to respond, and chose to stand by his earlier statement, provoking an outcry in the Whig papers.<ref>Merry, p. 99</ref>\n\nAnother concern was the third-party candidacy of President Tyler, which might split the Democratic vote. Tyler had been nominated by a group of loyal officeholders. Under no illusions he could win, he believed he could rally states' rights supporters and populists to hold the balance of power in the election. Only Jackson had the stature to resolve the situation, which he did with two letters to friends in the Cabinet, that he knew would be shown to Tyler, stating that the President's supporters would be welcomed back into the Democratic fold. Jackson wrote that once Tyler withdrew, many Democrats would embrace him for his pro-annexation stance. The former president also used his influence to stop [[Francis Preston Blair]] and his ''Globe'' newspaper, the semi-official organ of the Democratic Party, from attacking Tyler. These proved enough; Tyler withdrew from the race in August.<ref>Borneman, pp. 117\u2013120</ref><ref>Merry, pp. 100\u2013103</ref>\n\nParty troubles were a third concern. Polk and Calhoun made peace when a former South Carolina congressman, [[Francis Pickens]] visited Tennessee and came to Columbia for two days and to the Hermitage for sessions with the increasingly ill Jackson. Calhoun wanted the ''Globe'' dissolved, and that Polk would act against the 1842 tariff and promote Texas annexation. Reassured on these points, Calhoun became a strong supporter.<ref>Merry, pp. 104\u2013107</ref>\n\nPolk was aided regarding Texas when Clay, realizing his anti-annexation letter had cost him support, attempted in two subsequent letters to clarify his position. These angered both sides, which attacked Clay as insincere.<ref>Borneman, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Texas also threatened to divide the Democrats sectionally, but Polk managed to appease most Southern party leaders without antagonizing Northern ones.<ref name=Merry107108>Merry, pp. 107\u2013108</ref> As the election drew closer, it became clear that most of the country favored the annexation of Texas, and some Southern Whig leaders supported Polk's campaign due to Clay's anti-annexation stance.<ref name=Merry107108/>\n\n[[File:1844 Electoral Map.png|thumb|Results of the 1844 presidential election]]\n\nThe campaign was vitriolic; both major party candidates were accused of various acts of malfeasance; Polk was accused of being both a duelist and a coward. The most damaging smear was the [[black propaganda#United States media|Roorback forgery]]; in late August an item appeared in an [[abolitionist]] newspaper, part of a book detailing fictional travels through the South of a Baron von Roorback, an imaginary German nobleman. The Ithaca ''Chronicle'' printed it without labeling it as fiction, and inserted a sentence alleging that the traveler had seen forty slaves who had been sold by Polk after being branded with his initials. The item was withdrawn by the ''Chronicle'' when challenged by the Democrats, but it was widely reprinted. Borneman suggested that the forgery backfired on Polk's opponents as it served to remind voters that Clay too was a slaveholder,<ref>Borneman, pp. 121\u2013122</ref> [[John Eisenhower]], in his journal article on the election, stated that the smear came too late to be effectively rebutted, and likely cost Polk Ohio. Southern newspapers, on the other hand, went far in defending Polk, one Nashville newspaper alleging that his slaves preferred their bondage to freedom.<ref>Eisenhower, p. 84</ref> Polk himself implied to newspaper correspondents that the only slaves he owned had either been inherited or had been purchased from relatives in financial distress; this paternalistic image was also painted by surrogates like Gideon Pillow. This was not true, though not known at the time; by then he had bought over thirty slaves, both from relatives and others, mainly for the purpose of procuring labor for his Mississippi cotton plantation.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 12\u201313</ref>\n\nThere was no uniform election day in 1844; states voted between November 1 and 12.<ref name= \"borneman125\">Borneman, p. 125</ref> Polk won the election with 49.5% of the popular vote and 170 of the 275 electoral votes.<ref name=Merry109111>Merry, pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Becoming the first president elected despite losing his state of residence (Tennessee),<ref name = \"borneman125\" /> Polk also lost his birth state, North Carolina. However, he won Pennsylvania and New York, where Clay lost votes to the antislavery Liberty Party candidate [[James G. Birney]], who got more votes in New York than Polk's margin of victory.

He presided over a country whose population had doubled every twenty years since the [[American Revolution]] and which had reached demographic parity with [[Great Britain]].<ref name=Merry132133>Merry, pp. 132\u2013133</ref> Polk's tenure saw continued technological improvements, including the continued expansion of [[railroad]]s and increased use of the [[telegraph]].<ref name=Merry132133/> These improved communications and growing demographics increasingly made the United States into a strong military power, while also stoking [[expansionism]].<ref name=Merry131132/> However, sectional divisions remained and became worse during his tenure.\n\nPolk set four clearly defined goals for his administration:<ref name=Merry131132>Merry, pp. 131\u2013132</ref>\n* Reestablish the [[Independent Treasury|Independent Treasury System]]\u2014the Whigs had abolished the one created under Van Buren.\n* Reduce [[Tariffs in American history|tariffs]].\n* Acquire some or all of the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon Country]].\n* Acquire California and its harbors from Mexico.\n\nWhile his domestic aims represented continuity with past Democratic policies, successful completion of Polk's foreign policy goals would represent the first major [[United States territorial acquisitions|American territorial gains]] since the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819.<ref name=Merry131132/>\n\n===Transition, inauguration and appointments===\n{{further|Inauguration of James K.

At a time when an incoming president might retain some or all of his predecessor's department heads, Polk wanted an entirely fresh Cabinet, but this proved delicate. Tyler's final Secretary of State was Calhoun, leader of a considerable faction of the Democratic Party, but, when approached by emissaries, he did not take offense and was willing to step down.<ref name = bergeron2325 />\n\nPolk did not want his Cabinet to contain presidential hopefuls, though he chose to nominate [[James Buchanan]] of Pennsylvania, whose ambition for the presidency was well-known, as Secretary of State.<ref name=Merry114117>Merry, pp. 114\u2013117</ref> Tennessee's [[Cave Johnson]], a close friend and ally of Polk, was nominated for the position of Postmaster General, with George Bancroft, the historian who had placed a crucial role in Polk's nomination, as Navy Secretary.<ref name=Merry117119>Merry, pp. 117\u2013119</ref> Polk's choices met with the approval of Andrew Jackson, whom Polk met with in January 1845 for the last time, as Jackson died that June.<ref name=Merry117119/>\n\nTyler's last Navy Secretary, [[John Y. Mason]] of Virginia, Polk's friend since college days and a longtime political ally, was not on the original list. As Cabinet choices were affected by factional politics and President Tyler's drive to resolve the Texas issue before leaving office, Polk at the last minute chose him as Attorney General.<ref name =\"bergeron2325\">Bergeron, pp. 23\u201325</ref> Polk also chose Mississippi Senator Walker as Secretary of the Treasury and New York's [[William Marcy]] as Secretary of War. All gained Senate confirmation after Polk took office. The members worked well together, and few replacements were necessary. One reshuffle was required in 1846 when Bancroft, who wanted a diplomatic posting, became [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. minister to Britain]].<ref>Bergeron, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nAs Polk put together his Cabinet, President Tyler sought to complete the annexation of Texas. While the Senate had defeated an earlier treaty that would annex the republic, Tyler urged Congress to pass a joint resolution, relying on its constitutional power to admit states.<ref name=Merry120124>Merry, pp. 120\u2013124</ref> There were disagreements about the terms under which Texas would be admitted and Polk became involved in negotiations to break the impasse.

He proclaimed his fidelity to Jackson's principles by quoting his famous toast, \"Every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment, 'Our Federal Union\u2014it must be preserved.'\"<ref>Borneman, p. 141</ref> He stated his opposition to a national bank, and repeated that the tariff could include incidental protection. Although he did not mention slavery specifically, he alluded to it, decrying those who would tear down an institution protected by the Constitution.<ref>Borneman, pp. 141\u2013142</ref>\n\nPolk devoted the second half of his speech to foreign affairs, and specifically to expansion. He applauded the annexation of Texas, warning that Texas was no affair of any other nation, and certainly none of Mexico's. He spoke of the Oregon Country, and of the many who were migrating, pledging to safeguard America's rights there, and to protect the settlers.<ref>Borneman, pp. 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nAs well as appointing Cabinet officers to advise him, Polk made his sister's son, [[Joseph Knox Walker|J. Knox Walker]], his [[Secretary to the President of the United States|personal secretary]], an especially important position because, other than his slaves, Polk had no staff at the White House. Walker, who lived at the White House with his growing family (two children were born to him while living there), performed his duties competently through his uncle's presidency.

By treaty, Russia had waived any claim south of the southern border of Alaska, which it possessed until 1867, and Spain, which claimed the Pacific Coast to the [[42nd parallel north|42nd parallel]], ceded any claims it might have north of that to the United States under the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. This was just before Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821.<ref>Merry, pp. 163\u2013167</ref> Claims of the indigenous peoples of the region to their traditional lands were not a factor.\n\n[[File:Oregoncountry2.png|thumb|left|alt=A map of the undivided Oregon Country|Map of [[Oregon Country]], which the [[Oregon Treaty]] split between the Americans and British at the 49th parallel]]\n\nRather than war over the distant and low-population territory, the United States and Britain had negotiated. Since the signing of the [[Treaty of 1818]], the Oregon Country had been under the joint occupation and control of the United Kingdom and the United States. Previous U.S. administrations had offered to divide the region along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which was not acceptable to Britain, as it had commercial interests along the Columbia River.<ref name=merry168169>Merry, pp. 168\u2013169</ref> Britain's preferred partition was unacceptable to Polk, as it would have awarded [[Puget Sound]] and all lands north of the Columbia River to Britain, and Britain was unwilling to accept the 49th parallel extended to the Pacific, as it meant the entire opening to Puget Sound would be in American hands, isolating its settlements along the [[Fraser River]].<ref name=merry168169/>\n\n[[Edward Everett]], President Tyler's ambassador to Great Britain, had informally proposed dividing the territory at the 49th parallel with the strategic [[Vancouver Island]] granted to the British, thus allowing an opening to the Pacific. But when the new British minister in Washington, [[Richard Pakenham]] arrived in 1844 prepared to follow up, he found that many Americans desired the entire territory.<ref>Leonard, p. 95</ref> Oregon had not been a major issue in the 1844 election. However, the heavy influx of settlers, mostly American, to the Oregon Country in 1845, and the rising spirit of expansionism in the United States as Texas and Oregon seized the public's eye, made a treaty with Britain more urgent.<ref>Bergeron, pp.  115\u2013116</ref> Many Democrats believed that the United States should span from coast to coast, a philosophy described as [[Manifest Destiny]].<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nThough both sides sought an acceptable compromise, each also saw the territory as an important geopolitical asset that would play a large part in determining the dominant power in North America.<ref name=merry168169/> In his inaugural address, Polk announced that he viewed the U.S. claim to the land as \"clear and unquestionable\", provoking threats of war from British leaders should Polk attempt to take control of the entire territory.<ref name=merry170171>Merry, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> Polk had refrained in his address from asserting a claim to the entire territory, which extended north to 54 degrees, 40 minutes north latitude, although the Democratic Party platform called for such a claim.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 116\u2013118</ref> Despite Polk's hawkish rhetoric, he viewed war over Oregon as unwise, and Polk and Buchanan began negotiations with the British.<ref name=merry173175>Merry, pp. 173\u2013175</ref> Like his predecessors, Polk again proposed a division along the 49th parallel, which was immediately rejected by Pakenham.<ref>Merry, p. 190</ref> Secretary of State Buchanan was wary of a two-front war with Mexico and Britain, but Polk was willing to risk war with both countries in pursuit of a favorable settlement.<ref name=merry190191>Merry, pp. 190\u2013191</ref> In his annual message to Congress in December 1845, Polk requested approval of giving Britain a one-year notice (as required in the Treaty of 1818) of his intention to terminate the joint occupancy of Oregon.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> In that message, he quoted from the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to denote America's intention of keeping European powers out, the first significant use of it since its origin in 1823.<ref>Pletcher, p. 307</ref> After much debate, Congress eventually passed the resolution in April 1846, attaching its hope that the dispute would be settled amicably.<ref>Leonard, p. 118</ref>\n\nWhen the British Foreign Secretary, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], learned of the proposal rejected by Pakenham, Aberdeen asked the United States to re-open negotiations, but Polk was unwilling unless a proposal was made by the British.<ref name=merry196197>Merry, pp. 196\u2013197</ref> With Britain moving towards free trade with the [[repeal of the Corn Laws]], good trade relations with the United States were more important to Aberdeen than a distant territory.<ref>Leonard, p. 108</ref> In February 1846, Polk allowed Buchanan to inform [[Louis McLane]], the American ambassador to Britain, that Polk's administration would look favorably on a British proposal to divide the continent at the 49th parallel.<ref>Bergeron, p. 128</ref> In June 1846, Pakenham presented an offer to the Polk administration, calling for a boundary line at the 49th parallel, with the exception that Britain would retain all of Vancouver Island, and there would be limited navigation rights for British subjects on the Columbia River until the expiration of the charter of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1859.<ref>Pletcher, pp. 407\u2013410</ref> Polk and most of his Cabinet were prepared to accept the proposal, but Buchanan, in a reversal, urged that the United States seek control of all of the Oregon Territory.

Sending the U.S. Army there was a provocative act.<ref name=Merry188189/> Although Polk had the military prepare for war, he did not believe it would come to that; he thought Mexico would give in under duress,<ref>Greenberg, pp. 76\u201377</ref> which proved to be a significant miscalculation.\n\n[[File:Polk proclamation.gif|thumb|left|upright|Polk's presidential proclamation of [[Mexican\u2013American War|war against Mexico]]]]\n\nPolk hoped that a show of force by the U.S. military under Taylor and Conner could avert war and lead to negotiations with the Mexican government.<ref name=Merry188189/> In late 1845, Polk sent diplomat [[John Slidell]] to Mexico to purchase New Mexico and California for $30 million, as well as securing Mexico's agreement to a Rio Grande border.<ref name=merry193194>Merry, pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slidell arrived in [[Mexico City]] in December 1845. Mexican President [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] was unwilling to receive him because of the hostility of the public towards the United States.

Initially, his army did not advance further than [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], at the mouth of the Nueces.<ref>Borneman, pp. 190\u2013191</ref> On January 13, 1846, Polk ordered Taylor to proceed to the Rio Grande, though it took him time to prepare for the march.<ref>Borneman, pp. 199\u2013200</ref> Polk was convinced that sending Taylor to the [[Nueces Strip]] would provoke war; even if it did not, he was prepared to have Congress declare it.<ref>Greenberg, p. 95</ref>\n\nSlidell returned to Washington in May 1846 and gave his opinion that negotiations with the Mexican government were unlikely to be successful. Polk regarded the treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an \"ample cause of war\", and he prepared to ask Congress to declare it.<ref>Haynes, p. 129</ref> Meanwhile, in late March, General Taylor had reached the Rio Grande, and his army camped across the river from [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]]. In April, after Mexican general [[Pedro de Ampudia]] demanded that Taylor return to the Nueces River, Taylor began a blockade of Matamoros. A skirmish on the northern side of the Rio Grande on April 25 ended in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers, and became known as the [[Thornton Affair]]. Word did not reach Washington until May 9, and Polk immediately convened the Cabinet and obtained their approval of his plan to send a war message to Congress on the ground that Mexico had, as Polk put it in his message, \"shed American blood on the American soil\".<ref>Greenberg, pp. 101\u2013104</ref> Polk's message was crafted to present the war as a just and necessary defense of the country against a neighbor that had long troubled the United States.<ref name=\"lee2\">Lee, pp. 517\u2013518</ref>\n\nThe House overwhelmingly approved a resolution declaring war and authorizing the president to accept 50,000 volunteers into the military.<ref name=merry244246>Merry, pp. 245\u2013246</ref> Some of those voting in favor were unconvinced that the U.S. had just cause to go to war, but feared to be deemed unpatriotic.<ref>Borneman, pp. 205\u2013206</ref> In the Senate, war opponents led by Calhoun also questioned Polk's version of events.<ref name=merry246247>Merry, pp. 246\u2013247</ref> Nonetheless, the House resolution passed the Senate in a 40\u20132 vote, with Calhoun abstaining, marking the beginning of the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref name=merry246247/>\n\n=====Course of the war=====\n[[File:Mexican\u2013American War (without Scott's Campaign)-en.svg|thumb|alt=Map of the southwestern United States, including Texas, and also displaying Mexico, with the movements of the forces in the war marked on it|Overview map of the war {{legend|#FEE8B1|Disputed territory}} {{legend|#EFE0C7|United States territory, 1848}} {{legend|#D4E697|Mexican territory, 1848}}{{legend|#FFFFE0|After treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo}}]]\n\nAfter the initial skirmishes, Taylor and much of his army marched away from the river to secure the supply line, leaving a makeshift base, [[Fort Texas]]. On the way back to the Rio Grande, Mexican forces under General [[Mariano Arista]] attempted to block Taylor's way as other troops [[Siege of Fort Texas|laid siege to Fort Texas]], forcing the U.S. Army general to the attack if he hoped to relieve the fort. In the [[Battle of Palo Alto]], the first major engagement of the war, Taylor's troops forced Arista's from the field, suffering only four dead to hundreds for the Mexicans. The next day, Taylor led the army to victory in the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]], putting the Mexican Army to rout.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 160\u2013166</ref> The early successes boosted support for the war, which despite the lopsided votes in Congress had deeply divided the nation.<ref name = \"L164\">Leonard, p. 164</ref> Many Northern Whigs opposed the war, as did others; they felt Polk had used patriotism to manipulate the nation into fighting a war the goal of which was to give slavery room to expand.<ref>Leonard, p. 162</ref>\n\nPolk distrusted the two senior officers, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Winfield Scott]] and Taylor, as both were Whigs, and would have replaced them with Democrats, but felt Congress would not approve it. He offered Scott the position of top commander in the war, which the general accepted. Polk and Scott already knew and disliked each other: the President made the appointment despite the fact that Scott had sought his party's presidential nomination for the 1840 election.<ref>Borneman, pp. 254\u2013256</ref><ref name= \"s134\">Seigenthaler, p. 134</ref> Polk came to believe that Scott was too slow in getting himself and his army away from Washington and to the Rio Grande, and was outraged to learn Scott was using his influence in Congress to defeat the administration's plan to expand the number of generals.<ref>Leonard, p. 166</ref> The news of Taylor's victory at Resaca de la Palma arrived then, and Polk decided to have Taylor take command in the field, and Scott to remain in Washington. Polk also ordered Commodore Conner to allow [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] to return to Mexico from his exile in Havana, thinking that he would negotiate a treaty ceding territory to the U.S. for a price. Polk sent representatives to Cuba for talks with Santa Anna.\n\nPolk sent an army expedition led by [[Stephen W. Kearny]] towards Santa Fe, to territory beyond the original claims in Texas.<ref>Merry, pp. 259\u2013262</ref>  In 1845, Polk, fearful of French or British intervention, had sent Lieutenant [[Archibald H.

Polk's request ignited opposition, as he had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas). It was unclear whether such newly acquired lands would be slave or free, and there was fierce and acrimonious sectional debate. A freshman Democratic Congressman, [[David Wilmot]] of Pennsylvania, previously a firm supporter of Polk's administration, offered an amendment to the bill, the [[Wilmot Proviso]], that would ban slavery in any land acquired using the money. The appropriation bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, passed the House, but died in the Senate.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 235\u2013237</ref> This discord cost Polk's party, with Democrats losing control of the House in the [[1846 United States House of Representatives elections|1846 elections]]. In early 1847, though, Polk was successful in passing a bill raising further regiments, and he also finally won approval for the appropriation.<ref name=merry343349>Merry, pp. 343\u2013349</ref>\n\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, 1847]]\nTo try to bring the war to a quick end, in July 1846 Polk considered supporting a potential coup led by the exiled Mexican former president, General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], with the hope that Santa Anna would sell parts of California.<ref name=merry238240>Merry, pp. 238\u2013240</ref>  Santa Anna was in exile in Cuba, still a colony of Spain. Polk sent an envoy to have secret talks with Santa Anna. The U.S. Consul in Havana, R.B. Campbell, began seeking a way to engage with Santa Anna. A U.S. citizen of Spanish birth, Col. Alejandro Jos\u00e9 Atocha, knew Santa Anna and acted initially as an intermediary. Polk noted his contacts with Atocha in his diary, who said that Santa Anna was interested in concluding a treaty with the U.S. gaining territory while Mexico received payment that would include settling its debts. Polk decided that Atocha was untrustworthy and sent his own representative, [[Alexander Slidell Mackenzie]], (a relative of John Slidell) to meet with Santa Anna. Mackenzie told Santa Anna that Polk wished to see him in power and that if they came to an agreement that the U.S. naval blockade would be lifted briefly to allow Santa Anna to return to Mexico. Polk requested $2 million from Congress to be used to negotiate a treaty with Mexico or payment to Mexico before a treaty was signed. The blockade was indeed briefly lifted and Santa Anna returned to Mexico, not to head a government that would negotiate a treaty with the U.S., but rather to organize a military defense of his homeland. Santa Anna gloated over Polk's na\u00efvet\u00e9;<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 251\u201355</ref> Polk had been \"snookered\" by Santa Anna.<ref>Merry, plate 27 caption.</ref> Instead of coming to a negotiated settlement with the U.S., Santa Anna mounted a defense of Mexico and fought to the bitter end.  \"His actions would prolong the war for at least a year, and more than any other single person, it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of short war.\"<ref>Guardino, Peter. ''The Dead March: A History of the Mexican-American War''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2017, p 88.</ref>\n\nThis caused Polk to harden his position on Mexico,<ref>Borneman, pp. 229, 244\u2013246</ref> and he ordered an American landing at [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], the most important Mexican port on the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Accordingly, Taylor disobeyed orders to remain near Monterrey.<ref name= \"s134\" /> In March 1847, Polk learned that Taylor had continued to march south, capturing the northern Mexican town of [[Saltillo]].<ref>Borneman, pp. 247\u2013248</ref> Continuing beyond Saltillo, Taylor's army fought a larger Mexican force, led by Santa Anna, in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. Initial reports gave the victory to Mexico, with great rejoicing, but Santa Anna retreated. Mexican casualties were five times that of the Americans, and the victory made Taylor even more of a military hero in the American public's eyes, though Polk preferred to credit the bravery of the soldiers rather than the Whig general.<ref>Borneman, pp. 249\u2013252</ref>\n\nThe U.S. changed the course of the war with its invasion of Mexico's heartland through Veracruz and ultimately the capture of Mexico City, following hard fighting. In March 1847, Scott landed in Veracruz, and quickly [[Siege of Veracruz|won control]] of the city.<ref>Leonard, pp. 174\u2013175</ref> The Mexicans expected that yellow fever and other tropical diseases would weaken the U.S. forces. With the capture of Veracruz, Polk dispatched [[Nicholas Trist]], Buchanan's chief clerk, to accompany Scott's army and negotiate a peace treaty with Mexican leaders.<ref>Woodworth, p. 255</ref> Trist was instructed to seek the cession of Alta California, New Mexico, and [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]], recognition of the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas, and U.S. access across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]].<ref name=merry360361/> Trist was authorized to make a payment of up to $30 million in exchange for these concessions.<ref name=merry360361>Merry, pp. 360\u2013361</ref>\n\nIn August 1847, as he advanced towards Mexico City, Scott defeated Santa Anna at the [[Battle of Contreras]] and the [[Battle of Churubusco]].<ref name=merry381382>Merry, pp. 381\u2013382</ref> With the Americans at the gates of Mexico City, Trist negotiated with commissioners, but the Mexicans were willing to give up little.<ref>Pletcher, pp. 518\u2013520</ref> Scott prepared [[Battle for Mexico City|to take Mexico City]], which he did in mid-September.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 276\u2013296</ref> In the United States, a heated political debate emerged regarding how much of Mexico the United States should seek to annex, Whigs such as Henry Clay arguing that the United States should only seek to settle the Texas border question, and some expansionists arguing for the [[All of Mexico Movement|annexation of all of Mexico]].<ref name=merry394397>Merry, pp. 394\u2013397</ref> War opponents were also active; Whig Congressman [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois introduced the \"exact spot\" resolutions, calling on Polk to state exactly where American blood had been shed on American soil to start the war, but the House refused to consider them.<ref>Woodworth, p. 293</ref>\n\n=====Peace: the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo=====\n[[File:Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.png|thumb|The [[Mexican Cession]] (in red) was acquired through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. The [[Gadsden Purchase]] (in orange) was acquired through purchase after Polk left office.]]\n\nFrustrated by a lack of progress in negotiations, Polk ordered Trist to return to Washington, but the diplomat, when the notice of recall arrived in mid-November 1847, ignored the order, deciding to remain and writing a lengthy letter to Polk the following month to justify his decision. Polk considered having Butler, designated as Scott's replacement, forcibly remove him from Mexico City.<ref>Leonard, pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Though outraged by Trist's defiance, Polk decided to allow him some time to negotiate a treaty.<ref name=merry420421>Merry, pp. 420\u2013421</ref>\n\nThroughout January 1848, Trist regularly met with officials in Mexico City, though at the request of the Mexicans, the treaty signing took place in Guadalupe Hidalgo, a small town near Mexico City. Trist was willing to allow Mexico to keep Baja California, as his instructions allowed, but successfully haggled for the inclusion of the important harbor of [[San Diego]] in a cession of Alta California. Provisions included the Rio Grande border and a $15 million payment to Mexico. On February 2, 1848, Trist and the Mexican delegation signed the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Polk received the document on February 19,<ref>Borneman, pp. 308\u2013309</ref><ref>Pletcher, p. 517</ref> and, after the Cabinet met on the 20th, decided he had no choice but to accept it. If he turned it down, with the House by then controlled by the Whigs, there was no assurance Congress would vote funding to continue the war. Both Buchanan and Walker dissented, wanting more land from Mexico, a position with which the President was sympathetic, though he considered Buchanan's view motivated by his ambition.<ref>Greenberg, pp. 260\u2013261</ref>\n\nSome senators opposed the treaty because they wanted to take no Mexican territory; others hesitated because of the irregular nature of Trist's negotiations. Polk waited in suspense for two weeks as the Senate considered it, sometimes hearing that it would likely be defeated, and that Buchanan and Walker were working against it. He was relieved when the two Cabinet officers lobbied on behalf of the treaty. On March 10, the Senate ratified the treaty in a 38\u201314 vote, on a vote that cut across partisan and geographic lines.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 104\u2013105</ref> The Senate made some modifications to the treaty before ratification, and Polk worried that the Mexican government would reject them. On June 7, Polk learned that Mexico had ratified the treaty.<ref name=merry448450>Merry, pp. 448\u2013450</ref> Polk declared the treaty in effect as of July 4, 1848, thus ending the war.<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 180\">Leonard, p. 180</ref> With the acquisition of California, Polk had accomplished all four of his major presidential goals.<ref name=merry448450/> With the exception of the territory acquired by the 1853 [[Gadsden Purchase]], the territorial acquisitions under Polk established the modern borders of the [[Contiguous United States]].<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 180\"/>\n\n====Postwar and the territories====\n[[File:United States 1845-03-1845-12.png|thumb|United States states and territories when Polk entered office]]\n[[File:United States 1849-1850.png|thumb|United States states and territories when Polk left office]]\n\nPolk had been anxious to establish a territorial government for Oregon once the treaty was effective in 1846, but the matter became embroiled in the arguments over slavery, though few thought Oregon suitable for that institution. A bill to establish an Oregon territorial government passed the House after being amended to bar slavery; the bill died in the Senate when opponents ran out the clock on the congressional session. A resurrected bill, still barring slavery, again passed the House in January 1847 but it was not considered by the Senate before Congress adjourned in March. By the time Congress met again in December, California and New Mexico were in U.S. hands, and Polk in his annual message urged the establishment of territorial governments in all three.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 202\u2013205</ref> The [[Missouri Compromise]] had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territories by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36\u00b030\u2032 latitude, and Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory.<ref name=merry452453>Merry, pp. 452\u2013453</ref> If extended to the Pacific, this would have made slavery illegal in San Francisco, but allowed it in Monterey and Los Angeles.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 143</ref> A plan to accomplish the extension was defeated in the House by a bipartisan alliance of Northerners.<ref>Merry, pp. 458\u2013459</ref> As the last congressional session before the 1848 election came to a close, Polk signed the lone territorial bill passed by Congress, which established the [[Oregon Territory|Territory of Oregon]] and prohibited slavery in it.<ref>Merry, pp. 460\u2013461</ref>\n\nWhen Congress reconvened in December 1848, Polk asked it in his annual message to establish territorial governments in California and New Mexico, a task made especially urgent by the onset of the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>Bergeron, p. 208</ref> The divisive issue of slavery blocked any such legislation, though congressional action continued until the final hours of Polk's term. When the bill was amended to have the laws of Mexico apply to the southwest territories until Congress changed them (thus effectively banning slavery), Polk made it clear that he would veto it, considering it the Wilmot Proviso in another guise. It was not until the [[Compromise of 1850]] that the matter of the territories was resolved.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n====Other initiatives====\nPolk's ambassador to the [[Republic of New Granada]], [[Benjamin Alden Bidlack]], negotiated the [[Mallarino\u2013Bidlack Treaty]].<ref name=\"Conniff1\">Conniff, pp. 19\u201320</ref> Though Bidlack had initially only sought to remove tariffs on American goods, Bidlack and New Granadan Foreign Minister [[Manuel Mar\u00eda Mallarino]] negotiated a broader agreement that deepened military and trade ties between the two countries.<ref name=\"Conniff1\"/> The treaty also allowed for the construction of the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railway]].<ref name=\"randall1\"/> In an era of slow overland travel, the treaty gave the United States a route for a quicker journey between its eastern and western coasts.<ref name=\"randall1\"/> In exchange, Bidlack agreed to have the United States guarantee New Granada's sovereignty over the [[Isthmus of Panama]].<ref name=\"Conniff1\"/> The treaty won ratification in both countries in 1848.<ref name=\"randall1\">Randall, pp. 27\u201333</ref> The agreement helped to establish a stronger American influence in the region, as the Polk administration sought to ensure that Great Britain would not dominate [[Central America]].<ref name=\"randall1\"/> The United States would use the rights granted under the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty as a justification for its military interventions in Latin America through the remainder of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Conniff1\"/>\n\nIn mid-1848, President Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, [[Romulus Mitchell Saunders]], to negotiate the purchase of [[Cuba]] and offer [[Spain]] up to $100&nbsp;million, a large sum at the time for one territory, equal to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|100000000|1848}}}} in present-day terms.{{inflation-fn|US}} Cuba was close to the United States and had slavery, so the idea appealed to Southerners but was unwelcome in the North.

At the time, it was the custom to have geographic balance on the Supreme Court, and Baldwin had been from Pennsylvania. Polk's efforts to fill Baldwin's seat became embroiled in Pennsylvania politics and the efforts of factional leaders to secure the lucrative post of Collector of Customs for the Port of Philadelphia. As Polk attempted to find his way through the minefield of Pennsylvania politics, a second position on the high court became vacant with the death, in September 1845, of Justice [[Joseph Story]]; his replacement was expected to come from his native New England. Because Story's death had occurred while the Senate was not in session, Polk was able to make a [[recess appointment]], choosing Senator [[Levi Woodbury]] of New Hampshire, and when the Senate reconvened in December 1845, Woodbury was confirmed.

Polk departed the White House on March 3, leaving behind him a clean desk, though he worked from his hotel or the Capitol on last-minute appointments and bill signings. He attended Taylor's inauguration on March 5 (March 4, the presidential inauguration day until 1937, fell on a Sunday, and thus the ceremony was postponed a day), and though he was unimpressed with the new President, wished him the best.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 254\u2013257</ref>\n\n==Post-presidency and death==\n[[File:James Polk Grave.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble tomb, with four columns supporting a roof|James K.

His father, Samuel Polk, in 1827 left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land, and divided about 53 slaves among his widow and children in his will. James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, either directly or from deceased brothers. In 1831, he became an absentee cotton planter, sending slaves to clear [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] land that his father had left him near [[Somerville, Tennessee]]. Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land, a cotton plantation near [[Coffeeville, Mississippi]], hoping to increase his income. The land in Mississippi was richer than that in Somerville, and Polk transferred his Tennessee slaves there, taking care to conceal from them that they were to be sent south. From the start of 1839, Polk, having bought out his brother-in-law, owned all of the Mississippi plantation, and ran it on a mostly absentee basis for the rest of his life. He occasionally visited<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 13\u201315</ref>\u2014for example, he spent much of April 1844 on his Mississippi plantation, right before the Democratic convention.<ref>Greenberg, p. 33</ref>\n\nAdding to the inherited slaves, in 1831, Polk purchased five more, mostly buying them in Kentucky, and expending $1,870; the youngest had a recorded age of 11. As older children sold for a higher price, slave sellers routinely lied about age. Between 1834 and 1835, he bought five more, aged from 2 to 37, the youngest a granddaughter of the oldest. The amount expended was $2,250. In 1839, he bought eight slaves from his brother William at a cost of $5,600. This represented three young adults and most of a family, though not including the father, whom James Polk had previously owned, and who had been sold to a slave trader as a chronic runaway.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 15\u201317, 32</ref>\n\nThe expenses of four campaigns (three for governor, one for the presidency) in six years kept Polk from making more slave purchases until after he was living in the White House.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 16</ref> In an era when the presidential salary was expected to cover wages for the White House servants, Polk replaced them with slaves from his home in Tennessee.<ref>Greenberg, p. 74</ref> Polk did not purchase slaves with his presidential salary, likely for political reasons. Instead, he reinvested earnings from his plantation in the purchase of slaves, enjoining secrecy on his agent: \"that as my ''private business'' does not concern the public, you will keep it to yourself\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 17\u201318, 21\u201322</ref>\n\nPolk saw the plantation as his route to a comfortable existence after his presidency for himself and his wife; he did not intend to return to the practice of law. Hoping the increased labor force would increase his retirement income, he purchased seven slaves in 1846, through an agent, aged roughly between 12 and 17. The 17 year old and one of the 12 year olds were purchased together at an [[estate sale]]; the agent within weeks resold the younger boy to Polk's profit. The year 1847 saw the purchase of nine more. Three he purchased from Gideon Pillow, and his agent purchased six slaves, aged between 10 and 20. By the time of the purchase from Pillow, the Mexican War had begun and Polk sent payment with the letter in which he offered Pillow a commission in the Army. The purchase from Pillow was a slave Polk had previously owned and had sold for being a disruption, and his wife and child. None of the other slaves Polk purchased as President, all younger than 20, came with a parent, and as only in the one case were two slaves bought together, most likely none had an accompanying sibling as each faced life on Polk's plantation.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nDiscipline for those owned by Polk varied over time. At the Tennessee plantation, he employed an [[Plantations in the American South#Overseer|overseer]] named Herbert Biles, who was said to be relatively indulgent. Biles's illness in 1833 resulted in Polk replacing him with Ephraim Beanland, who tightened discipline and increased work. Polk backed his overseer, returning runaways who complained of beatings and other harsh treatment, \"even though every report suggested that the overseer was a heartless brute\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 28\u201331</ref> Beanland was hired for the Mississippi plantation, but was soon dismissed by Polk's partner, who deemed Beanland too harsh as the slaves undertook the arduous task of clearing the timber from the new plantation so it could be used for cotton farming. His replacement was discharged after a year for being too indulgent; the next died of dysentery in 1839. Others followed, and it was not until 1845 that Polk found a satisfactory overseer, John Mairs, who remained the rest of Polk's life and was still working at the plantation for Sarah Polk in 1860, when the widow sold a half-share in many of her slaves. There had been a constant stream of runaways under Mairs' predecessors, many seeking protection at the plantation of Polk relatives or friends; only one ran away between the time of Mairs' hiring and the end of 1847, but the overseer had to report three absconded slaves (including the one who had fled earlier) to Polk in 1848 and 1849.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 32\u201341</ref>\n\nPolk's will, dated February 28, 1849, a few days before the end of his presidency, contained the nonbinding expectation that his slaves were to be freed when both he and Sarah Polk were dead. The Mississippi plantation was expected to be the support of Sarah Polk during her widowhood. Sarah Polk lived until 1891, but the slaves were freed in 1865 by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which abolished slavery in the United States. By selling a half-interest in the slaves in 1860, Sarah Polk had given up the sole power to free them, and it is unlikely that her new partner, having paid $28,500 for a half-interest in the plantation and its slaves, would have allowed the laborers to go free had she died while slavery was legal.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 77\u201379</ref>\n\nLike Jackson, Polk saw the politics of slavery as a side issue compared to more important matters such as territorial expansion and economic policy.<ref name=Merry129130>Merry, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> The issue of slavery became increasingly polarizing during the 1840s, and Polk's expansionary policies increased its divisiveness.<ref name=Merry129130/> During his presidency, many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the \"[[Slave Power]]\", and claimed that spreading slavery was the reason he supported Texas Annexation and later war with Mexico.<ref>Haynes, p. 154</ref> Polk did support the expansion of slavery's realm, with his views informed by his own family's experience of settling Tennessee, bringing slaves with them.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 132\u2013133</ref> He believed in Southern rights, meaning both the right of slave states not to have that institution interfered with by the Federal government, and the right of individual Southerners to bring their slaves with them into the new territory.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 146</ref> Though Polk opposed the Wilmot Proviso, he also condemned southern agitation on the issue, and he accused both northern and southern leaders of attempting to use the slavery issue for political gain.<ref name=merry356358>Merry, pp. 356\u2013358</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2017, new tombstones for three of his slaves, Elias Polk, Mary Polk and Matilda Polk, were placed in the [[Nashville City Cemetery]].

[[Sam Houston]] is said to have observed that Polk, a teetotaler, was \"a victim of the use of water as a beverage\".<ref>Borneman, p. 11.</ref> Little was published about him but two biographies released in the wake of his death. Polk was not again the subject of a major biography until 1922, when Eugene I. McCormac published ''James K. Polk: A Political Biography''. McCormac relied heavily on Polk's presidential diary, first published in 1909.<ref>Borneman, p. 352</ref> When historians began ranking the presidents in 1948, Polk ranked 10th in [[Arthur M.

Calabresi]] and [[Christopher S.

Truman]] called Polk \"a great president. Said what he intended to do and did it.\"<ref>Truman & Ferrell, p. 390.</ref> Bergeron noted that the matters that Polk settled, he settled for his time. The questions of the banking system, and of the tariff, which Polk had made two of the main issues of his presidency, were not significantly revised until the 1860s. Similarly, the Gadsden Purchase, and [[Alaska Purchase|that of Alaska]] (1867), were the only major U.S. expansions until the 1890s.<ref name  = \"bergeron261\" />\n\nPaul H.

He previously was [[speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] (1835\u20131839) and [[List of Governors of Tennessee|governor of Tennessee]] (1839\u20131841). A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Andrew Jackson]], he was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and an advocate of [[Jacksonian democracy]]. Polk is chiefly known for extending the territory of the United States during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]; during his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the [[annexation of Texas|annexation]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Oregon Territory]], and the [[Mexican Cession]] following the American victory in the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\nAfter building a successful law practice in [[Tennessee]], Polk was elected to the state legislature (1823) and then to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1825, becoming a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson. After serving as chairman of the [[Ways and Means Committee]], he became Speaker in 1835, the only president to have been Speaker. Polk left Congress to run for [[governor of Tennessee]]; he won in 1839, but lost in 1841 and 1843. He was a [[dark horse]] candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]]; he entered his party's convention as a potential nominee for vice president, but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could secure the necessary two-thirds majority. In the general election, Polk defeated [[Henry Clay]] of the rival [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].\n\nHistorians have praised Polk for having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set. After a negotiation fraught with risk of war, he reached a settlement with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] over the [[Oregon boundary dispute|disputed]] [[Oregon Country]], the territory for the most part being divided along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican\u2013American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly all the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. He secured a substantial reduction of [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]] rates with the [[Walker tariff]] of 1846. The same year, he achieved his other major goal, re-establishment of the [[Independent Treasury]] system. Historian [[Thomas A. Bailey]] says that during the Mexican war, \"Polk was an energetic and indefatigable war leader, and he emerged, partly through rare good luck, with uninterrupted success. He kept the sole direction of the war in his own hands, from grand strategy to the procurement of mules.\"<ref>Thomas A. Bailey, ''Presidential greatness: The image and the man from George Washington to the present'' (1966) pp 224-25.</ref>  True to his campaign pledge to serve only one term, Polk left office in 1849 and returned to Tennessee where he died three months after leaving the White House.\n\nThough he is relatively obscure today, scholars have [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|ranked]] Polk favorably for his ability to promote and achieve the major items on his presidential agenda. However, he has also been criticized for leading the country into an unnecessary war against Mexico and for exacerbating sectional divides. A slaveholder for most of his adult life, he owned a plantation in Mississippi and bought slaves while president. A major legacy of Polk's presidency is territorial expansion, as the United States reached the Pacific coast and became poised to be a world power. However, sectional divisions in the U.S. were exacerbated by the territorial expansion and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] is considered a direct consequence of Polk's policy.\n\n==Early life==\n{{further|President James K.

When the [[Tennessee Legislature]] deadlocked on whom to elect as U.S. senator in 1823 (until 1913, legislators, not the people, elected senators), Jackson's name was placed in nomination. Polk broke from his usual allies, casting his vote as a member of the state House of Representatives for the general in Jackson's victory. This boosted Jackson's presidential chances by giving him recent political experience{{efn|Jackson had served in both houses of Congress in the 1790s.}} to match his military accomplishments.

Polk, like other Jackson supporters, believed that Speaker of the House [[Henry Clay]] had traded his support as fourth-place finisher (the House may only choose from among the top three) to Adams in a [[Corrupt bargain#Election of 1824|Corrupt Bargain]] in exchange for being the new Secretary of State. Polk had in August 1824 declared his candidacy for the following year's election to the House of Representatives from [[Tennessee's 6th congressional district]].<ref name=\"Borneman23\">Borneman, p. 23</ref> The district stretched from Maury County south to the Alabama line, and extensive electioneering was expected of the five candidates. Polk campaigned so vigorously that Sarah began to worry about his health.

Polk made his first major speech on March 13, 1826, in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and that the president should be elected by popular vote.<ref name=\"Borneman24\">Borneman, p. 24</ref> Remaining bitter at the alleged Corrupt Bargain between Adams and Clay, Polk became a vocal critic of the [[presidency of John Quincy Adams|administration]], frequently voting against its policies.<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 38\u201339</ref> Sarah Polk remained at home in Columbia during her husband's first year in Congress, but accompanied him to Washington beginning in December 1826; she assisted him with his correspondence, and came to hear James's speeches.<ref name=\"Borneman26\" />\n\nPolk won re-election in 1827 and continued to oppose the Adams administration.<ref name=\"Borneman26\">Borneman, p. 26</ref> He remained in close touch with Jackson, and when Jackson ran for president in [[1828 United States presidential election|1828]], Polk was a corresponding advisor on his campaign. Following Jackson's victory over Adams, Polk became one of the new President's most prominent and loyal supporters in the House.<ref>Merry, pp. 30, 39\u201340</ref> Working on Jackson's behalf, Polk successfully opposed federally-funded \"[[internal improvements]]\" such as a proposed Buffalo-to-New Orleans road, and he was pleased by Jackson's [[Maysville Road veto]] in May 1830, when Jackson blocked a bill to finance a road extension entirely within one state, Kentucky, deeming it unconstitutional.<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Jackson opponents alleged that the veto message, which strongly complained about Congress' penchant for passing [[pork barrel]] projects, was written by Polk, but he denied this, stating that the message was entirely the President's.<ref>Seigenthaler, p. 46</ref>\n\nPolk served as Jackson's most prominent House ally in the \"[[Bank War]]\" that developed over Jackson's opposition to the re-authorization of the [[Second Bank of the United States]].<ref name=Merry4243>Merry, pp. 42\u201343</ref> The Second Bank, headed by [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] of Philadelphia, not only held federal dollars, but controlled much of the credit in the United States, as it could present currency issued by local banks for redemption in gold or silver. Some Westerners, including Jackson, opposed the Second Bank, deeming it a monopoly acting in the interest of Easterners.<ref>Borneman, pp. 28\u201329</ref> Polk, as a member of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]], conducted investigations of the Second Bank, and though the committee voted for a bill to renew the bank's charter (scheduled to expire in 1836), Polk issued a strong minority report condemning the bank. The bill passed Congress in 1832, but Jackson vetoed it and Congress failed to override the veto. Jackson's action was highly controversial in Washington, but had considerable public support, and he [[1832 United States presidential election|won easy re-election in 1832]].<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 48\u201352</ref>\n\nLike many Southerners, Polk favored low tariffs on imported goods, and initially sympathized with [[John C. Calhoun]]'s opposition to the [[Tariff of Abominations]] during the [[Nullification Crisis]] of 1832\u20131833, but came over to Jackson's side as Calhoun moved towards advocating secession. Thereafter, Polk remained loyal to Jackson as the President sought to assert federal authority. Polk condemned secession and supported the [[Force Bill]] against South Carolina, which had claimed the authority to nullify federal tariffs. The matter was settled by Congress passing a [[Tariff of 1833|compromise tariff]].<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\n===Ways and Means chair and Speaker of the House===\nIn December 1833, after being elected to a fifth consecutive term, Polk, with Jackson's backing, became the chairman of Ways and Means, a powerful position in the House.<ref name=\"Borneman33\">Borneman, p. 33</ref> In that position, Polk supported Jackson's withdrawal of federal funds from the Second Bank. Polk's committee issued a report questioning the Second Bank's finances, and another supporting Jackson's actions against it. In April 1834, the Ways and Means Committee reported a bill to regulate state deposit banks, which, when passed, enabled Jackson to deposit funds in [[pet banks]], and Polk got legislation passed to allow the sale of the government's stock in the Second Bank.<ref name= \"a\" /><ref>Merry, p. 42</ref>\n\nIn June 1834, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Andrew Stevenson]] resigned from Congress to become [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Borneman34\">Borneman, p. 34</ref> With Jackson's support, Polk ran for Speaker against fellow Tennessean [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], Calhoun disciple [[Richard Henry Wilde]], and [[Joel Barlow Sutherland]] of Pennsylvania.

Greater Whig strength in Tennessee helped White carry his state, though Polk's home district went for Van Buren.<ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 55\u201356</ref> Ninety percent of Tennessee voters had supported Jackson in 1832, but many in the state disliked the destruction of the Second Bank, or were unwilling to support Van Buren.<ref>{{cite web|title=Democrats vs. Whigs|url=http://www.tn4me.org/article.cfm/a_id/194/minor_id/67/major_id/22/era_id/4|publisher=[[Tennessee State Museum]]|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs Speaker, Polk worked for the policies of Jackson and later Van Buren. Polk appointed committees with Democratic chairs and majorities, including the New York radical [[Churchill C. Cambreleng|C. C. Cambreleng]] as the new Ways and Means chair, although he tried to maintain the Speaker's traditional nonpartisan appearance. The two major issues during Polk's speakership were slavery and, after the [[Panic of 1837]], the economy. Polk firmly enforced the \"[[gag rule]]\", by which the House of Representatives would not accept or debate citizen petitions regarding slavery.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler5760\">Seigenthaler, pp. 57\u201361</ref> This ignited fierce protests from John Quincy Adams, who was by then a congressman from Massachusetts and an abolitionist. Instead of finding a way to silence Adams, Polk frequently engaged in useless shouting matches, leading Jackson to conclude that the Speaker should have shown better leadership.<ref>Remini, p. 406</ref> Van Buren and Polk faced pressure to rescind the [[Specie Circular]], Jackson's 1836 order that payment for government lands be in gold and silver. Some believed this had led to the crash by causing a lack of confidence in paper currency issued by banks. Despite such arguments, with support from Polk and his cabinet, Van Buren chose to back the Specie Circular. Polk and Van Buren attempted to establish an Independent Treasury system that would allow the government to oversee its own deposits (rather than using pet banks), but the bill was defeated in the House.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler5760\"/> It eventually passed in 1840.<ref>Bergeron, p. 1</ref>\n\nUsing his thorough grasp of the House's rules,<ref>Bergeron, p. 12</ref> Polk attempted to bring greater order to its proceedings. Unlike many of his peers, he never challenged anyone to a duel no matter how much they insulted his honor.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler62\">Seigenthaler, p. 62</ref> The economic downturn cost the Democrats seats, so that when he faced re-election as Speaker in December 1837, he won by only 13 votes, and he foresaw defeat in 1839. Polk by then had presidential ambitions, but was well aware that no Speaker had ever become president (Polk is still the only one to have held both offices).<ref>Borneman, p. 38</ref> After seven terms in the House, two as Speaker, he announced that he would not seek re-election, choosing instead to run for Governor of Tennessee in the 1839 election.<ref>Merry, pp. 45\u201346</ref>\n\n===Governor of Tennessee===\nIn 1835, the Democrats had lost the governorship of Tennessee for the first time in their history, and Polk decided to return home to help the party.<ref>Seigenthaler, p. 64</ref> Polk returned to a Tennessee afire for White and Whiggism; the state had changed greatly in its political loyalties since the days of Jacksonian domination. Polk undertook his first statewide campaign, against the Whig incumbent, [[Newton Cannon]], who sought a third two-year term as governor.<ref>Bergeron, p. 13</ref> The fact that Polk was the one called upon to \"redeem\" Tennessee from the Whigs tacitly acknowledged him as head of the state Democratic Party.<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nPolk campaigned on national issues, whereas Cannon stressed matters local to Tennessee. After being bested by Polk in the early debates, the governor retreated to Nashville, by then the state capital, alleging important official business. Polk made speeches across the state, seeking to become known more widely than in his native [[Middle Tennessee]]. When Cannon came back on the campaign trail in the final days, Polk pursued him, hastening the length of the state to be able to debate the governor again. On Election Day, August 1, 1839, Polk defeated Cannon, 54,102 to 51,396, as the Democrats recaptured the state legislature and won back three congressional seats in Tennessee.<ref>Borneman, pp. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nTennessee's governor had limited power\u2014there was no gubernatorial veto, and the small size of the state government limited any political patronage. But Polk saw the office as a springboard for his national ambitions, seeking to be nominated as Van Buren's vice presidential running mate at the [[1840 Democratic National Convention]] in Baltimore in May.<ref>Borneman, p. 43</ref> Polk hoped to be the replacement if Vice President [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] was dumped from the ticket; Johnson was disliked by many Southern whites for fathering two daughters by a biracial mistress, and attempting to introduce them into white society. Johnson was from Kentucky, so Polk's Tennessee residence would keep the New Yorker Van Buren's ticket balanced. The convention chose to endorse no one for vice president, stating that a choice would be made once the popular vote was cast. Three weeks after the convention, recognizing that Johnson was too popular in the party to be ousted, Polk withdrew his name. The Whig presidential candidate, General [[William Henry Harrison]], conducted [[William Henry Harrison presidential campaign, 1840|a rollicking campaign]] with the motto \"[[Tippecanoe and Tyler Too]]\", easily winning both the national vote and that in Tennessee. Polk campaigned in vain for Van Buren<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 32\">Leonard, p. 32</ref> and was embarrassed by the outcome; Jackson, who had returned to his home, [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|the Hermitage]], near Nashville, was horrified at the prospect of a Whig administration. Harrison's death after a month in office in 1841 left the presidency to Vice President [[John Tyler]], who soon broke with the Whigs.<ref>Borneman, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nPolk's three major programs during his governorship; regulating state banks, implementing state internal improvements, and improving education all failed to win the approval of the legislature.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler66\">Seigenthaler, p. 66</ref> His only major success as governor was his politicking to secure the replacement of Tennessee's two Whig U.S. senators with Democrats.<ref name=\"Seigenthaler66\"/> Polk's tenure was hindered by the continuing nationwide economic crisis that had followed the Panic of 1837 and which had caused Van Buren to lose the [[1840 U.S. presidential election|1840 election]].<ref>Merry, p. 47</ref>\n\nEncouraged by the success of Harrison's campaign, the Whigs ran a freshman legislator from frontier [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], [[James C. Jones]] against Polk in 1841. \"Lean Jimmy\" had proven one of their most effective gadflies against Polk, and his lighthearted tone at campaign debates was very effective against the serious Polk. The two debated the length of Tennessee,<ref>Bergeron, p. 14</ref> and Jones's support of distribution to the states of surplus federal revenues, and of a national bank, struck a chord with Tennessee voters. On election day in August 1841, Polk was defeated by 3,000 votes, the first time he had been beaten at the polls.<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 32\"/> Polk returned to Columbia and the practice of law, and prepared for a rematch against Jones in 1843, but though the new governor took less of a joking tone, it made little difference to the outcome, as Polk was beaten again,<ref>Bergeron, pp. 18\u201319</ref> this time by 3,833 votes.<ref name= \"Borneman p.64\">Borneman, p. 64</ref><ref name=\"Seigenthaler68\">Seigenthaler, p. 68</ref> In the wake of his second statewide defeat in three years, Polk faced an uncertain political future.<ref name=Merry4749>Merry, pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\n==Election of 1844==\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1844}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\nDespite his loss, Polk was determined to become the next [[vice president of the United States]], seeing it as a path to the presidency.<ref name=\"Merry p. 43-44\">Merry, pp. 43\u201344</ref> Van Buren was the frontrunner for the [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] Democratic nomination, and Polk engaged in a careful campaign to become his running mate.<ref name=Merry5053>Merry, pp. 50\u201353</ref> The former president faced opposition from Southerners who feared his views on slavery, while his handling of the Panic of 1837\u2014he had refused to rescind the Specie Circular\u2014aroused opposition from some in the West (today's Midwest) who believed his hard money policies had hurt their section of the country.<ref name=Merry5053/> Many Southerners backed Calhoun's candidacy, Westerners rallied around Senator [[Lewis Cass]] of Michigan, and former Vice President Johnson also maintained a strong following among Democrats.<ref name=Merry5053/> Jackson assured Van Buren by letter that Polk in his campaigns for governor had \"fought the battle well and fought it alone\".<ref>Borneman, p. 51</ref> Polk hoped to gain Van Buren's support, hinting in a letter that a Van Buren/Polk ticket could carry Tennessee, but found him unconvinced.<ref>Borneman, pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe biggest political issue in the United States at that time was territorial expansion.<ref name = \"a\" /> The [[Republic of Texas]] had [[Texas Revolution|successfully revolted]] against Mexico in 1836. With the republic largely populated by American emigres, those on both sides of the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]] border between the U.S. and Texas deemed it inevitable that Texas would join the United States, but this would anger Mexico, which considered Texas a breakaway province, and threatened war if the United States annexed it. Jackson, as president, had recognized Texas independence, but the initial momentum toward annexation had stalled.<ref>Borneman, pp. 67\u201374</ref> Britain was seeking to expand her influence in Texas: Britain had abolished slavery, and if Texas did the same, it would provide a western haven for runaways to match one in the North.<ref>Leonard, pp. 67\u201368</ref> A Texas not in the United States would also stand in the way of what was deemed America's [[Manifest Destiny]] to overspread the continent.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nClay was nominated for president by acclamation at the April [[1844 Whig National Convention]], with New Jersey's [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] his running mate.<ref>Leonard, p. 36</ref> A Kentucky slaveholder at a time when opponents of [[Texas annexation]] argued that it would give slavery more room to spread, Clay sought a nuanced position on the issue.

Polk was one of the few major Democrats to have declared for the annexation of Texas.<ref>Borneman, pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n\nThe convention opened on May 27, 1844. A crucial question was whether the nominee needed two-thirds of the delegate vote, as had been the case at previous Democratic conventions, or merely a majority. A vote for two-thirds would doom Van Buren's candidacy due to the opposition to him.<ref>Merry, pp. 84\u201385</ref> With the support of the Southern states, the two-thirds rule was passed.<ref name=Merry8788>Merry, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Van Buren won a majority on the first presidential ballot, but failed to win the necessary two-thirds, and his support slowly faded on subsequent ballots.<ref name=Merry8788/> Cass, Johnson, Calhoun and [[James Buchanan]] had also received votes on the first ballot, and Cass took the lead on the fifth ballot.<ref>Merry, p. 89</ref> After seven ballots, the convention remained deadlocked: Cass could not attract the support necessary to reach two-thirds, and Van Buren's supporters were more and more discouraged about the former president's chances. Delegates were ready to consider a new candidate who might break the stalemate.<ref>Bergeron, p. 16</ref>\n\nWhen the convention adjourned after the seventh ballot, Pillow, who had been waiting for an opportunity to press Polk's name, conferred with [[George Bancroft]] of Massachusetts, a politician and historian who was a longtime Polk correspondent, and who had planned to nominate Polk for vice president. Bancroft had supported Van Buren's candidacy, and was willing to see New York Senator [[Silas Wright]] head the ticket, but Wright would not consider taking a nomination that Van Buren wanted. Pillow and Bancroft decided if Polk were nominated for president, Wright might accept the second spot. Before the eighth ballot, former Attorney General [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)|Benjamin F. Butler]], head of the New York delegation, read a pre-written letter from Van Buren to be used if he could not be nominated, withdrawing in Wright's favor. But Wright (who was in Washington) had also entrusted a pre-written letter to a supporter, in which he refused to be considered as a presidential candidate, and stated in the letter that he agreed with Van Buren's position on Texas. Had Wright's letter not been read he most likely would have been nominated, but without him, Butler began to rally Van Buren supporters for Polk as the best possible candidate, and Bancroft placed Polk's name before the convention. On the eighth ballot, Polk received only 44 votes to Cass's 114 and Van Buren's 104, but the deadlock showed signs of breaking. Butler formally withdrew Van Buren's name, many delegations declared for the Tennessean, and on the ninth ballot Polk received 233 ballots to Cass's 29, making him the Democratic nominee for president. The nomination was then made unanimous.<ref name = \"a\"/><ref>Borneman, pp. 102\u2013106</ref>\n\nThis left the question of the vice presidential candidate. Butler urged Wright's nomination, and the convention agreed to this, with only eight Georgia delegates dissenting. As the convention waited, word of Wright's nomination was sent to him in Washington via [[telegraph]]. Having by proxy declined an almost certain presidential nomination, Wright would not accept the second place. Senator [[Robert J. Walker]] of Mississippi, a close Polk ally, suggested former senator [[George M. Dallas]] of Pennsylvania. Dallas was acceptable enough to all factions, and gained the vice presidential nomination on the second ballot. The delegates passed a platform, and adjourned on May 30.<ref>Borneman, pp. 104\u2013108</ref><ref>Merry, pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nAlthough many contemporary politicians, including Pillow and Bancroft, claimed credit in the years to come for getting Polk the nomination, [[Walter R. Borneman]] felt that most credit was due to Jackson and Polk, \"the two who had done the most were back in Tennessee, one an aging icon ensconced at the Hermitage and the other a shrewd lifelong politician waiting expectantly in Columbia\".<ref>Borneman, p. 108</ref> Whigs mocked Polk with the chant \"Who is James K.

The dispatches were sent on to Columbia, arriving the same day, and letters and newspapers describing what had happened at Baltimore were in Polk's hands by June 6. He accepted his nomination by letter dated June 12, alleging that he had never sought the office, and stating his intent to serve only one term.<ref>Borneman, pp. 111\u2013114</ref> Wright was embittered by what he called the \"foul plot\" against Van Buren, and demanded assurances that Polk had played no part; it was only after Polk professed that he had remained loyal to Van Buren that Wright supported his campaign.<ref>Eisenhower, p. 81</ref> Following the custom of the time that presidential candidates avoid electioneering or appearing to seek the office, Polk remained in Columbia and made no speeches. He engaged in an extensive correspondence with Democratic Party officials as he managed his campaign. Polk made his views known in his acceptance letter and through responses to questions sent by citizens that were printed in newspapers, often by arrangement.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 17\u201319</ref><ref>Seigenthaler, pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nA potential pitfall for Polk's campaign was the issue of whether the tariff should be for revenue only, or with the intent to protect American industry. Polk finessed the tariff issue in a published letter. Recalling that he had long stated that tariffs should only be sufficient to finance government operations, he maintained that stance, but wrote that within that limitation, government could and should offer \"fair and just protection\" to American interests, including manufacturers.<ref>Merry, pp. 97\u201399</ref> He refused to expand on this stance, acceptable to most Democrats, despite the Whigs pointing out that he had committed himself to nothing. In September, a delegation of Whigs from nearby [[Giles County, Tennessee|Giles County]] came to Columbia, armed with specific questions on Polk's views regarding the current tariff, the Whig-passed [[Tariff of 1842]], and with the stated intent of remaining in Columbia until they got answers. Polk took several days to respond, and chose to stand by his earlier statement, provoking an outcry in the Whig papers.<ref>Merry, p. 99</ref>\n\nAnother concern was the third-party candidacy of President Tyler, which might split the Democratic vote. Tyler had been nominated by a group of loyal officeholders. Under no illusions he could win, he believed he could rally states' rights supporters and populists to hold the balance of power in the election. Only Jackson had the stature to resolve the situation, which he did with two letters to friends in the Cabinet, that he knew would be shown to Tyler, stating that the President's supporters would be welcomed back into the Democratic fold. Jackson wrote that once Tyler withdrew, many Democrats would embrace him for his pro-annexation stance. The former president also used his influence to stop [[Francis Preston Blair]] and his ''Globe'' newspaper, the semi-official organ of the Democratic Party, from attacking Tyler. These proved enough; Tyler withdrew from the race in August.<ref>Borneman, pp. 117\u2013120</ref><ref>Merry, pp. 100\u2013103</ref>\n\nParty troubles were a third concern. Polk and Calhoun made peace when a former South Carolina congressman, [[Francis Pickens]] visited Tennessee and came to Columbia for two days and to the Hermitage for sessions with the increasingly ill Jackson. Calhoun wanted the ''Globe'' dissolved, and that Polk would act against the 1842 tariff and promote Texas annexation. Reassured on these points, Calhoun became a strong supporter.<ref>Merry, pp. 104\u2013107</ref>\n\nPolk was aided regarding Texas when Clay, realizing his anti-annexation letter had cost him support, attempted in two subsequent letters to clarify his position. These angered both sides, which attacked Clay as insincere.<ref>Borneman, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Texas also threatened to divide the Democrats sectionally, but Polk managed to appease most Southern party leaders without antagonizing Northern ones.<ref name=Merry107108>Merry, pp. 107\u2013108</ref> As the election drew closer, it became clear that most of the country favored the annexation of Texas, and some Southern Whig leaders supported Polk's campaign due to Clay's anti-annexation stance.<ref name=Merry107108/>\n\n[[File:1844 Electoral Map.png|thumb|Results of the 1844 presidential election]]\n\nThe campaign was vitriolic; both major party candidates were accused of various acts of malfeasance; Polk was accused of being both a duelist and a coward. The most damaging smear was the [[black propaganda#United States media|Roorback forgery]]; in late August an item appeared in an [[abolitionist]] newspaper, part of a book detailing fictional travels through the South of a Baron von Roorback, an imaginary German nobleman. The Ithaca ''Chronicle'' printed it without labeling it as fiction, and inserted a sentence alleging that the traveler had seen forty slaves who had been sold by Polk after being branded with his initials. The item was withdrawn by the ''Chronicle'' when challenged by the Democrats, but it was widely reprinted. Borneman suggested that the forgery backfired on Polk's opponents as it served to remind voters that Clay too was a slaveholder,<ref>Borneman, pp. 121\u2013122</ref> [[John Eisenhower]], in his journal article on the election, stated that the smear came too late to be effectively rebutted, and likely cost Polk Ohio. Southern newspapers, on the other hand, went far in defending Polk, one Nashville newspaper alleging that his slaves preferred their bondage to freedom.<ref>Eisenhower, p. 84</ref> Polk himself implied to newspaper correspondents that the only slaves he owned had either been inherited or had been purchased from relatives in financial distress; this paternalistic image was also painted by surrogates like Gideon Pillow. This was not true, though not known at the time; by then he had bought over thirty slaves, both from relatives and others, mainly for the purpose of procuring labor for his Mississippi cotton plantation.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 12\u201313</ref>\n\nThere was no uniform election day in 1844; states voted between November 1 and 12.<ref name= \"borneman125\">Borneman, p. 125</ref> Polk won the election with 49.5% of the popular vote and 170 of the 275 electoral votes.<ref name=Merry109111>Merry, pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Becoming the first president elected despite losing his state of residence (Tennessee),<ref name = \"borneman125\" /> Polk also lost his birth state, North Carolina. However, he won Pennsylvania and New York, where Clay lost votes to the antislavery Liberty Party candidate [[James G. Birney]], who got more votes in New York than Polk's margin of victory.

He presided over a country whose population had doubled every twenty years since the [[American Revolution]] and which had reached demographic parity with [[Great Britain]].<ref name=Merry132133>Merry, pp. 132\u2013133</ref> Polk's tenure saw continued technological improvements, including the continued expansion of [[railroad]]s and increased use of the [[telegraph]].<ref name=Merry132133/> These improved communications and growing demographics increasingly made the United States into a strong military power, while also stoking [[expansionism]].<ref name=Merry131132/> However, sectional divisions remained and became worse during his tenure.\n\nPolk set four clearly defined goals for his administration:<ref name=Merry131132>Merry, pp. 131\u2013132</ref>\n* Reestablish the [[Independent Treasury|Independent Treasury System]]\u2014the Whigs had abolished the one created under Van Buren.\n* Reduce [[Tariffs in American history|tariffs]].\n* Acquire some or all of the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon Country]].\n* Acquire California and its harbors from Mexico.\n\nWhile his domestic aims represented continuity with past Democratic policies, successful completion of Polk's foreign policy goals would represent the first major [[United States territorial acquisitions|American territorial gains]] since the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819.<ref name=Merry131132/>\n\n===Transition, inauguration and appointments===\n{{further|Inauguration of James K.

At a time when an incoming president might retain some or all of his predecessor's department heads, Polk wanted an entirely fresh Cabinet, but this proved delicate. Tyler's final Secretary of State was Calhoun, leader of a considerable faction of the Democratic Party, but, when approached by emissaries, he did not take offense and was willing to step down.<ref name = bergeron2325 />\n\nPolk did not want his Cabinet to contain presidential hopefuls, though he chose to nominate [[James Buchanan]] of Pennsylvania, whose ambition for the presidency was well-known, as Secretary of State.<ref name=Merry114117>Merry, pp. 114\u2013117</ref> Tennessee's [[Cave Johnson]], a close friend and ally of Polk, was nominated for the position of Postmaster General, with George Bancroft, the historian who had placed a crucial role in Polk's nomination, as Navy Secretary.<ref name=Merry117119>Merry, pp. 117\u2013119</ref> Polk's choices met with the approval of Andrew Jackson, whom Polk met with in January 1845 for the last time, as Jackson died that June.<ref name=Merry117119/>\n\nTyler's last Navy Secretary, [[John Y. Mason]] of Virginia, Polk's friend since college days and a longtime political ally, was not on the original list. As Cabinet choices were affected by factional politics and President Tyler's drive to resolve the Texas issue before leaving office, Polk at the last minute chose him as Attorney General.<ref name =\"bergeron2325\">Bergeron, pp. 23\u201325</ref> Polk also chose Mississippi Senator Walker as Secretary of the Treasury and New York's [[William Marcy]] as Secretary of War. All gained Senate confirmation after Polk took office. The members worked well together, and few replacements were necessary. One reshuffle was required in 1846 when Bancroft, who wanted a diplomatic posting, became [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. minister to Britain]].<ref>Bergeron, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nAs Polk put together his Cabinet, President Tyler sought to complete the annexation of Texas. While the Senate had defeated an earlier treaty that would annex the republic, Tyler urged Congress to pass a joint resolution, relying on its constitutional power to admit states.<ref name=Merry120124>Merry, pp. 120\u2013124</ref> There were disagreements about the terms under which Texas would be admitted and Polk became involved in negotiations to break the impasse.

He proclaimed his fidelity to Jackson's principles by quoting his famous toast, \"Every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment, 'Our Federal Union\u2014it must be preserved.'\"<ref>Borneman, p. 141</ref> He stated his opposition to a national bank, and repeated that the tariff could include incidental protection. Although he did not mention slavery specifically, he alluded to it, decrying those who would tear down an institution protected by the Constitution.<ref>Borneman, pp. 141\u2013142</ref>\n\nPolk devoted the second half of his speech to foreign affairs, and specifically to expansion. He applauded the annexation of Texas, warning that Texas was no affair of any other nation, and certainly none of Mexico's. He spoke of the Oregon Country, and of the many who were migrating, pledging to safeguard America's rights there, and to protect the settlers.<ref>Borneman, pp. 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nAs well as appointing Cabinet officers to advise him, Polk made his sister's son, [[Joseph Knox Walker|J. Knox Walker]], his [[Secretary to the President of the United States|personal secretary]], an especially important position because, other than his slaves, Polk had no staff at the White House. Walker, who lived at the White House with his growing family (two children were born to him while living there), performed his duties competently through his uncle's presidency.

By treaty, Russia had waived any claim south of the southern border of Alaska, which it possessed until 1867, and Spain, which claimed the Pacific Coast to the [[42nd parallel north|42nd parallel]], ceded any claims it might have north of that to the United States under the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. This was just before Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821.<ref>Merry, pp. 163\u2013167</ref> Claims of the indigenous peoples of the region to their traditional lands were not a factor.\n\n[[File:Oregoncountry2.png|thumb|left|alt=A map of the undivided Oregon Country|Map of [[Oregon Country]], which the [[Oregon Treaty]] split between the Americans and British at the 49th parallel]]\n\nRather than war over the distant and low-population territory, the United States and Britain had negotiated. Since the signing of the [[Treaty of 1818]], the Oregon Country had been under the joint occupation and control of the United Kingdom and the United States. Previous U.S. administrations had offered to divide the region along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which was not acceptable to Britain, as it had commercial interests along the Columbia River.<ref name=merry168169>Merry, pp. 168\u2013169</ref> Britain's preferred partition was unacceptable to Polk, as it would have awarded [[Puget Sound]] and all lands north of the Columbia River to Britain, and Britain was unwilling to accept the 49th parallel extended to the Pacific, as it meant the entire opening to Puget Sound would be in American hands, isolating its settlements along the [[Fraser River]].<ref name=merry168169/>\n\n[[Edward Everett]], President Tyler's ambassador to Great Britain, had informally proposed dividing the territory at the 49th parallel with the strategic [[Vancouver Island]] granted to the British, thus allowing an opening to the Pacific. But when the new British minister in Washington, [[Richard Pakenham]] arrived in 1844 prepared to follow up, he found that many Americans desired the entire territory.<ref>Leonard, p. 95</ref> Oregon had not been a major issue in the 1844 election. However, the heavy influx of settlers, mostly American, to the Oregon Country in 1845, and the rising spirit of expansionism in the United States as Texas and Oregon seized the public's eye, made a treaty with Britain more urgent.<ref>Bergeron, pp.  115\u2013116</ref> Many Democrats believed that the United States should span from coast to coast, a philosophy described as [[Manifest Destiny]].<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nThough both sides sought an acceptable compromise, each also saw the territory as an important geopolitical asset that would play a large part in determining the dominant power in North America.<ref name=merry168169/> In his inaugural address, Polk announced that he viewed the U.S. claim to the land as \"clear and unquestionable\", provoking threats of war from British leaders should Polk attempt to take control of the entire territory.<ref name=merry170171>Merry, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> Polk had refrained in his address from asserting a claim to the entire territory, which extended north to 54 degrees, 40 minutes north latitude, although the Democratic Party platform called for such a claim.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 116\u2013118</ref> Despite Polk's hawkish rhetoric, he viewed war over Oregon as unwise, and Polk and Buchanan began negotiations with the British.<ref name=merry173175>Merry, pp. 173\u2013175</ref> Like his predecessors, Polk again proposed a division along the 49th parallel, which was immediately rejected by Pakenham.<ref>Merry, p. 190</ref> Secretary of State Buchanan was wary of a two-front war with Mexico and Britain, but Polk was willing to risk war with both countries in pursuit of a favorable settlement.<ref name=merry190191>Merry, pp. 190\u2013191</ref> In his annual message to Congress in December 1845, Polk requested approval of giving Britain a one-year notice (as required in the Treaty of 1818) of his intention to terminate the joint occupancy of Oregon.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> In that message, he quoted from the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to denote America's intention of keeping European powers out, the first significant use of it since its origin in 1823.<ref>Pletcher, p. 307</ref> After much debate, Congress eventually passed the resolution in April 1846, attaching its hope that the dispute would be settled amicably.<ref>Leonard, p. 118</ref>\n\nWhen the British Foreign Secretary, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], learned of the proposal rejected by Pakenham, Aberdeen asked the United States to re-open negotiations, but Polk was unwilling unless a proposal was made by the British.<ref name=merry196197>Merry, pp. 196\u2013197</ref> With Britain moving towards free trade with the [[repeal of the Corn Laws]], good trade relations with the United States were more important to Aberdeen than a distant territory.<ref>Leonard, p. 108</ref> In February 1846, Polk allowed Buchanan to inform [[Louis McLane]], the American ambassador to Britain, that Polk's administration would look favorably on a British proposal to divide the continent at the 49th parallel.<ref>Bergeron, p. 128</ref> In June 1846, Pakenham presented an offer to the Polk administration, calling for a boundary line at the 49th parallel, with the exception that Britain would retain all of Vancouver Island, and there would be limited navigation rights for British subjects on the Columbia River until the expiration of the charter of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1859.<ref>Pletcher, pp. 407\u2013410</ref> Polk and most of his Cabinet were prepared to accept the proposal, but Buchanan, in a reversal, urged that the United States seek control of all of the Oregon Territory.

Initially, his army did not advance further than [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], at the mouth of the Nueces.<ref>Borneman, pp. 190\u2013191</ref> On January 13, 1846, Polk ordered Taylor to proceed to the Rio Grande, though it took him time to prepare for the march.<ref>Borneman, pp. 199\u2013200</ref> Polk was convinced that sending Taylor to the [[Nueces Strip]] would provoke war; even if it did not, he was prepared to have Congress declare it.<ref>Greenberg, p. 95</ref>\n\nSlidell returned to Washington in May 1846 and gave his opinion that negotiations with the Mexican government were unlikely to be successful. Polk regarded the treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an \"ample cause of war\", and he prepared to ask Congress to declare it.<ref>Haynes, p. 129</ref> Meanwhile, in late March, General Taylor had reached the Rio Grande, and his army camped across the river from [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]]. In April, after Mexican general [[Pedro de Ampudia]] demanded that Taylor return to the Nueces River, Taylor began a blockade of Matamoros. A skirmish on the northern side of the Rio Grande on April 25 ended in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers, and became known as the [[Thornton Affair]]. Word did not reach Washington until May 9, and Polk immediately convened the Cabinet and obtained their approval of his plan to send a war message to Congress on the ground that Mexico had, as Polk put it in his message, \"shed American blood on the American soil\".<ref>Greenberg, pp. 101\u2013104</ref> Polk's message was crafted to present the war as a just and necessary defense of the country against a neighbor that had long troubled the United States.<ref name=\"lee2\">Lee, pp. 517\u2013518</ref>\n\nThe House overwhelmingly approved a resolution declaring war and authorizing the president to accept 50,000 volunteers into the military.<ref name=merry244246>Merry, pp. 245\u2013246</ref> Some of those voting in favor were unconvinced that the U.S. had just cause to go to war, but feared to be deemed unpatriotic.<ref>Borneman, pp. 205\u2013206</ref> In the Senate, war opponents led by Calhoun also questioned Polk's version of events.<ref name=merry246247>Merry, pp. 246\u2013247</ref> Nonetheless, the House resolution passed the Senate in a 40\u20132 vote, with Calhoun abstaining, marking the beginning of the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref name=merry246247/>\n\n=====Course of the war=====\n[[File:Mexican\u2013American War (without Scott's Campaign)-en.svg|thumb|alt=Map of the southwestern United States, including Texas, and also displaying Mexico, with the movements of the forces in the war marked on it|Overview map of the war {{legend|#FEE8B1|Disputed territory}} {{legend|#EFE0C7|United States territory, 1848}} {{legend|#D4E697|Mexican territory, 1848}}{{legend|#FFFFE0|After treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo}}]]\n\nAfter the initial skirmishes, Taylor and much of his army marched away from the river to secure the supply line, leaving a makeshift base, [[Fort Texas]]. On the way back to the Rio Grande, Mexican forces under General [[Mariano Arista]] attempted to block Taylor's way as other troops [[Siege of Fort Texas|laid siege to Fort Texas]], forcing the U.S. Army general to the attack if he hoped to relieve the fort. In the [[Battle of Palo Alto]], the first major engagement of the war, Taylor's troops forced Arista's from the field, suffering only four dead to hundreds for the Mexicans. The next day, Taylor led the army to victory in the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]], putting the Mexican Army to rout.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 160\u2013166</ref> The early successes boosted support for the war, which despite the lopsided votes in Congress had deeply divided the nation.<ref name = \"L164\">Leonard, p. 164</ref> Many Northern Whigs opposed the war, as did others; they felt Polk had used patriotism to manipulate the nation into fighting a war the goal of which was to give slavery room to expand.<ref>Leonard, p. 162</ref>\n\nPolk distrusted the two senior officers, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Winfield Scott]] and Taylor, as both were Whigs, and would have replaced them with Democrats, but felt Congress would not approve it. He offered Scott the position of top commander in the war, which the general accepted. Polk and Scott already knew and disliked each other: the President made the appointment despite the fact that Scott had sought his party's presidential nomination for the 1840 election.<ref>Borneman, pp. 254\u2013256</ref><ref name= \"s134\">Seigenthaler, p. 134</ref> Polk came to believe that Scott was too slow in getting himself and his army away from Washington and to the Rio Grande, and was outraged to learn Scott was using his influence in Congress to defeat the administration's plan to expand the number of generals.<ref>Leonard, p. 166</ref> The news of Taylor's victory at Resaca de la Palma arrived then, and Polk decided to have Taylor take command in the field, and Scott to remain in Washington. Polk also ordered Commodore Conner to allow [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] to return to Mexico from his exile in Havana, thinking that he would negotiate a treaty ceding territory to the U.S. for a price. Polk sent representatives to Cuba for talks with Santa Anna.\n\nPolk sent an army expedition led by [[Stephen W. Kearny]] towards Santa Fe, to territory beyond the original claims in Texas.<ref>Merry, pp. 259\u2013262</ref>  In 1845, Polk, fearful of French or British intervention, had sent Lieutenant [[Archibald H.

Polk's request ignited opposition, as he had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas). It was unclear whether such newly acquired lands would be slave or free, and there was fierce and acrimonious sectional debate. A freshman Democratic Congressman, [[David Wilmot]] of Pennsylvania, previously a firm supporter of Polk's administration, offered an amendment to the bill, the [[Wilmot Proviso]], that would ban slavery in any land acquired using the money. The appropriation bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, passed the House, but died in the Senate.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 235\u2013237</ref> This discord cost Polk's party, with Democrats losing control of the House in the [[1846 United States House of Representatives elections|1846 elections]]. In early 1847, though, Polk was successful in passing a bill raising further regiments, and he also finally won approval for the appropriation.<ref name=merry343349>Merry, pp. 343\u2013349</ref>\n\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, 1847]]\nTo try to bring the war to a quick end, in July 1846 Polk considered supporting a potential coup led by the exiled Mexican former president, General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], with the hope that Santa Anna would sell parts of California.<ref name=merry238240>Merry, pp. 238\u2013240</ref>  Santa Anna was in exile in Cuba, still a colony of Spain. Polk sent an envoy to have secret talks with Santa Anna. The U.S. Consul in Havana, R.B. Campbell, began seeking a way to engage with Santa Anna. A U.S. citizen of Spanish birth, Col. Alejandro Jos\u00e9 Atocha, knew Santa Anna and acted initially as an intermediary. Polk noted his contacts with Atocha in his diary, who said that Santa Anna was interested in concluding a treaty with the U.S. gaining territory while Mexico received payment that would include settling its debts. Polk decided that Atocha was untrustworthy and sent his own representative, [[Alexander Slidell Mackenzie]], (a relative of John Slidell) to meet with Santa Anna. Mackenzie told Santa Anna that Polk wished to see him in power and that if they came to an agreement that the U.S. naval blockade would be lifted briefly to allow Santa Anna to return to Mexico. Polk requested $2 million from Congress to be used to negotiate a treaty with Mexico or payment to Mexico before a treaty was signed. The blockade was indeed briefly lifted and Santa Anna returned to Mexico, not to head a government that would negotiate a treaty with the U.S., but rather to organize a military defense of his homeland. Santa Anna gloated over Polk's na\u00efvet\u00e9;<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 251\u201355</ref> Polk had been \"snookered\" by Santa Anna.<ref>Merry, plate 27 caption.</ref> Instead of coming to a negotiated settlement with the U.S., Santa Anna mounted a defense of Mexico and fought to the bitter end.  \"His actions would prolong the war for at least a year, and more than any other single person, it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of short war.\"<ref>Guardino, Peter. ''The Dead March: A History of the Mexican-American War''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2017, p 88.</ref>\n\nThis caused Polk to harden his position on Mexico,<ref>Borneman, pp. 229, 244\u2013246</ref> and he ordered an American landing at [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], the most important Mexican port on the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Accordingly, Taylor disobeyed orders to remain near Monterrey.<ref name= \"s134\" /> In March 1847, Polk learned that Taylor had continued to march south, capturing the northern Mexican town of [[Saltillo]].<ref>Borneman, pp. 247\u2013248</ref> Continuing beyond Saltillo, Taylor's army fought a larger Mexican force, led by Santa Anna, in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. Initial reports gave the victory to Mexico, with great rejoicing, but Santa Anna retreated. Mexican casualties were five times that of the Americans, and the victory made Taylor even more of a military hero in the American public's eyes, though Polk preferred to credit the bravery of the soldiers rather than the Whig general.<ref>Borneman, pp. 249\u2013252</ref>\n\nThe U.S. changed the course of the war with its invasion of Mexico's heartland through Veracruz and ultimately the capture of Mexico City, following hard fighting. In March 1847, Scott landed in Veracruz, and quickly [[Siege of Veracruz|won control]] of the city.<ref>Leonard, pp. 174\u2013175</ref> The Mexicans expected that yellow fever and other tropical diseases would weaken the U.S. forces. With the capture of Veracruz, Polk dispatched [[Nicholas Trist]], Buchanan's chief clerk, to accompany Scott's army and negotiate a peace treaty with Mexican leaders.<ref>Woodworth, p. 255</ref> Trist was instructed to seek the cession of Alta California, New Mexico, and [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]], recognition of the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas, and U.S. access across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]].<ref name=merry360361/> Trist was authorized to make a payment of up to $30 million in exchange for these concessions.<ref name=merry360361>Merry, pp. 360\u2013361</ref>\n\nIn August 1847, as he advanced towards Mexico City, Scott defeated Santa Anna at the [[Battle of Contreras]] and the [[Battle of Churubusco]].<ref name=merry381382>Merry, pp. 381\u2013382</ref> With the Americans at the gates of Mexico City, Trist negotiated with commissioners, but the Mexicans were willing to give up little.<ref>Pletcher, pp. 518\u2013520</ref> Scott prepared [[Battle for Mexico City|to take Mexico City]], which he did in mid-September.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 276\u2013296</ref> In the United States, a heated political debate emerged regarding how much of Mexico the United States should seek to annex, Whigs such as Henry Clay arguing that the United States should only seek to settle the Texas border question, and some expansionists arguing for the [[All of Mexico Movement|annexation of all of Mexico]].<ref name=merry394397>Merry, pp. 394\u2013397</ref> War opponents were also active; Whig Congressman [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois introduced the \"exact spot\" resolutions, calling on Polk to state exactly where American blood had been shed on American soil to start the war, but the House refused to consider them.<ref>Woodworth, p. 293</ref>\n\n=====Peace: the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo=====\n[[File:Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.png|thumb|The [[Mexican Cession]] (in red) was acquired through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. The [[Gadsden Purchase]] (in orange) was acquired through purchase after Polk left office.]]\n\nFrustrated by a lack of progress in negotiations, Polk ordered Trist to return to Washington, but the diplomat, when the notice of recall arrived in mid-November 1847, ignored the order, deciding to remain and writing a lengthy letter to Polk the following month to justify his decision. Polk considered having Butler, designated as Scott's replacement, forcibly remove him from Mexico City.<ref>Leonard, pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Though outraged by Trist's defiance, Polk decided to allow him some time to negotiate a treaty.<ref name=merry420421>Merry, pp. 420\u2013421</ref>\n\nThroughout January 1848, Trist regularly met with officials in Mexico City, though at the request of the Mexicans, the treaty signing took place in Guadalupe Hidalgo, a small town near Mexico City. Trist was willing to allow Mexico to keep Baja California, as his instructions allowed, but successfully haggled for the inclusion of the important harbor of [[San Diego]] in a cession of Alta California. Provisions included the Rio Grande border and a $15 million payment to Mexico. On February 2, 1848, Trist and the Mexican delegation signed the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Polk received the document on February 19,<ref>Borneman, pp. 308\u2013309</ref><ref>Pletcher, p. 517</ref> and, after the Cabinet met on the 20th, decided he had no choice but to accept it. If he turned it down, with the House by then controlled by the Whigs, there was no assurance Congress would vote funding to continue the war. Both Buchanan and Walker dissented, wanting more land from Mexico, a position with which the President was sympathetic, though he considered Buchanan's view motivated by his ambition.<ref>Greenberg, pp. 260\u2013261</ref>\n\nSome senators opposed the treaty because they wanted to take no Mexican territory; others hesitated because of the irregular nature of Trist's negotiations. Polk waited in suspense for two weeks as the Senate considered it, sometimes hearing that it would likely be defeated, and that Buchanan and Walker were working against it. He was relieved when the two Cabinet officers lobbied on behalf of the treaty. On March 10, the Senate ratified the treaty in a 38\u201314 vote, on a vote that cut across partisan and geographic lines.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 104\u2013105</ref> The Senate made some modifications to the treaty before ratification, and Polk worried that the Mexican government would reject them. On June 7, Polk learned that Mexico had ratified the treaty.<ref name=merry448450>Merry, pp. 448\u2013450</ref> Polk declared the treaty in effect as of July 4, 1848, thus ending the war.<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 180\">Leonard, p. 180</ref> With the acquisition of California, Polk had accomplished all four of his major presidential goals.<ref name=merry448450/> With the exception of the territory acquired by the 1853 [[Gadsden Purchase]], the territorial acquisitions under Polk established the modern borders of the [[Contiguous United States]].<ref name=\"Leonard, p. 180\"/>\n\n====Postwar and the territories====\n[[File:United States 1845-03-1845-12.png|thumb|United States states and territories when Polk entered office]]\n[[File:United States 1849-1850.png|thumb|United States states and territories when Polk left office]]\n\nPolk had been anxious to establish a territorial government for Oregon once the treaty was effective in 1846, but the matter became embroiled in the arguments over slavery, though few thought Oregon suitable for that institution. A bill to establish an Oregon territorial government passed the House after being amended to bar slavery; the bill died in the Senate when opponents ran out the clock on the congressional session. A resurrected bill, still barring slavery, again passed the House in January 1847 but it was not considered by the Senate before Congress adjourned in March. By the time Congress met again in December, California and New Mexico were in U.S. hands, and Polk in his annual message urged the establishment of territorial governments in all three.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 202\u2013205</ref> The [[Missouri Compromise]] had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territories by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36\u00b030\u2032 latitude, and Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory.<ref name=merry452453>Merry, pp. 452\u2013453</ref> If extended to the Pacific, this would have made slavery illegal in San Francisco, but allowed it in Monterey and Los Angeles.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 143</ref> A plan to accomplish the extension was defeated in the House by a bipartisan alliance of Northerners.<ref>Merry, pp. 458\u2013459</ref> As the last congressional session before the 1848 election came to a close, Polk signed the lone territorial bill passed by Congress, which established the [[Oregon Territory|Territory of Oregon]] and prohibited slavery in it.<ref>Merry, pp. 460\u2013461</ref>\n\nWhen Congress reconvened in December 1848, Polk asked it in his annual message to establish territorial governments in California and New Mexico, a task made especially urgent by the onset of the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>Bergeron, p. 208</ref> The divisive issue of slavery blocked any such legislation, though congressional action continued until the final hours of Polk's term. When the bill was amended to have the laws of Mexico apply to the southwest territories until Congress changed them (thus effectively banning slavery), Polk made it clear that he would veto it, considering it the Wilmot Proviso in another guise. It was not until the [[Compromise of 1850]] that the matter of the territories was resolved.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n====Other initiatives====\nPolk's ambassador to the [[Republic of New Granada]], [[Benjamin Alden Bidlack]], negotiated the [[Mallarino\u2013Bidlack Treaty]].<ref name=\"Conniff1\">Conniff, pp. 19\u201320</ref> Though Bidlack had initially only sought to remove tariffs on American goods, Bidlack and New Granadan Foreign Minister [[Manuel Mar\u00eda Mallarino]] negotiated a broader agreement that deepened military and trade ties between the two countries.<ref name=\"Conniff1\"/> The treaty also allowed for the construction of the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railway]].<ref name=\"randall1\"/> In an era of slow overland travel, the treaty gave the United States a route for a quicker journey between its eastern and western coasts.<ref name=\"randall1\"/> In exchange, Bidlack agreed to have the United States guarantee New Granada's sovereignty over the [[Isthmus of Panama]].<ref name=\"Conniff1\"/> The treaty won ratification in both countries in 1848.<ref name=\"randall1\">Randall, pp. 27\u201333</ref> The agreement helped to establish a stronger American influence in the region, as the Polk administration sought to ensure that Great Britain would not dominate [[Central America]].<ref name=\"randall1\"/> The United States would use the rights granted under the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty as a justification for its military interventions in Latin America through the remainder of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Conniff1\"/>\n\nIn mid-1848, President Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, [[Romulus Mitchell Saunders]], to negotiate the purchase of [[Cuba]] and offer [[Spain]] up to $100&nbsp;million, a large sum at the time for one territory, equal to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|100000000|1848}}}} in present-day terms.{{inflation-fn|US}} Cuba was close to the United States and had slavery, so the idea appealed to Southerners but was unwelcome in the North.

At the time, it was the custom to have geographic balance on the Supreme Court, and Baldwin had been from Pennsylvania. Polk's efforts to fill Baldwin's seat became embroiled in Pennsylvania politics and the efforts of factional leaders to secure the lucrative post of Collector of Customs for the Port of Philadelphia. As Polk attempted to find his way through the minefield of Pennsylvania politics, a second position on the high court became vacant with the death, in September 1845, of Justice [[Joseph Story]]; his replacement was expected to come from his native New England. Because Story's death had occurred while the Senate was not in session, Polk was able to make a [[recess appointment]], choosing Senator [[Levi Woodbury]] of New Hampshire, and when the Senate reconvened in December 1845, Woodbury was confirmed.

Polk departed the White House on March 3, leaving behind him a clean desk, though he worked from his hotel or the Capitol on last-minute appointments and bill signings. He attended Taylor's inauguration on March 5 (March 4, the presidential inauguration day until 1937, fell on a Sunday, and thus the ceremony was postponed a day), and though he was unimpressed with the new President, wished him the best.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 254\u2013257</ref>\n\n==Post-presidency and death==\n[[File:James Polk Grave.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble tomb, with four columns supporting a roof|James K.

His father, Samuel Polk, in 1827 left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land, and divided about 53 slaves among his widow and children in his will. James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, either directly or from deceased brothers. In 1831, he became an absentee cotton planter, sending slaves to clear [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] land that his father had left him near [[Somerville, Tennessee]]. Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land, a cotton plantation near [[Coffeeville, Mississippi]], hoping to increase his income. The land in Mississippi was richer than that in Somerville, and Polk transferred his Tennessee slaves there, taking care to conceal from them that they were to be sent south. From the start of 1839, Polk, having bought out his brother-in-law, owned all of the Mississippi plantation, and ran it on a mostly absentee basis for the rest of his life. He occasionally visited<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 13\u201315</ref>\u2014for example, he spent much of April 1844 on his Mississippi plantation, right before the Democratic convention.<ref>Greenberg, p. 33</ref>\n\nAdding to the inherited slaves, in 1831, Polk purchased five more, mostly buying them in Kentucky, and expending $1,870; the youngest had a recorded age of 11. As older children sold for a higher price, slave sellers routinely lied about age. Between 1834 and 1835, he bought five more, aged from 2 to 37, the youngest a granddaughter of the oldest. The amount expended was $2,250. In 1839, he bought eight slaves from his brother William at a cost of $5,600. This represented three young adults and most of a family, though not including the father, whom James Polk had previously owned, and who had been sold to a slave trader as a chronic runaway.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 15\u201317, 32</ref>\n\nThe expenses of four campaigns (three for governor, one for the presidency) in six years kept Polk from making more slave purchases until after he was living in the White House.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 16</ref> In an era when the presidential salary was expected to cover wages for the White House servants, Polk replaced them with slaves from his home in Tennessee.<ref>Greenberg, p. 74</ref> Polk did not purchase slaves with his presidential salary, likely for political reasons. Instead, he reinvested earnings from his plantation in the purchase of slaves, enjoining secrecy on his agent: \"that as my ''private business'' does not concern the public, you will keep it to yourself\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 17\u201318, 21\u201322</ref>\n\nPolk saw the plantation as his route to a comfortable existence after his presidency for himself and his wife; he did not intend to return to the practice of law. Hoping the increased labor force would increase his retirement income, he purchased seven slaves in 1846, through an agent, aged roughly between 12 and 17. The 17 year old and one of the 12 year olds were purchased together at an [[estate sale]]; the agent within weeks resold the younger boy to Polk's profit. The year 1847 saw the purchase of nine more. Three he purchased from Gideon Pillow, and his agent purchased six slaves, aged between 10 and 20. By the time of the purchase from Pillow, the Mexican War had begun and Polk sent payment with the letter in which he offered Pillow a commission in the Army. The purchase from Pillow was a slave Polk had previously owned and had sold for being a disruption, and his wife and child. None of the other slaves Polk purchased as President, all younger than 20, came with a parent, and as only in the one case were two slaves bought together, most likely none had an accompanying sibling as each faced life on Polk's plantation.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nDiscipline for those owned by Polk varied over time. At the Tennessee plantation, he employed an [[Plantations in the American South#Overseer|overseer]] named Herbert Biles, who was said to be relatively indulgent. Biles's illness in 1833 resulted in Polk replacing him with Ephraim Beanland, who tightened discipline and increased work. Polk backed his overseer, returning runaways who complained of beatings and other harsh treatment, \"even though every report suggested that the overseer was a heartless brute\".<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 28\u201331</ref> Beanland was hired for the Mississippi plantation, but was soon dismissed by Polk's partner, who deemed Beanland too harsh as the slaves undertook the arduous task of clearing the timber from the new plantation so it could be used for cotton farming. His replacement was discharged after a year for being too indulgent; the next died of dysentery in 1839. Others followed, and it was not until 1845 that Polk found a satisfactory overseer, John Mairs, who remained the rest of Polk's life and was still working at the plantation for Sarah Polk in 1860, when the widow sold a half-share in many of her slaves. There had been a constant stream of runaways under Mairs' predecessors, many seeking protection at the plantation of Polk relatives or friends; only one ran away between the time of Mairs' hiring and the end of 1847, but the overseer had to report three absconded slaves (including the one who had fled earlier) to Polk in 1848 and 1849.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 32\u201341</ref>\n\nPolk's will, dated February 28, 1849, a few days before the end of his presidency, contained the nonbinding expectation that his slaves were to be freed when both he and Sarah Polk were dead. The Mississippi plantation was expected to be the support of Sarah Polk during her widowhood. Sarah Polk lived until 1891, but the slaves were freed in 1865 by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which abolished slavery in the United States. By selling a half-interest in the slaves in 1860, Sarah Polk had given up the sole power to free them, and it is unlikely that her new partner, having paid $28,500 for a half-interest in the plantation and its slaves, would have allowed the laborers to go free had she died while slavery was legal.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 77\u201379</ref>\n\nLike Jackson, Polk saw the politics of slavery as a side issue compared to more important matters such as territorial expansion and economic policy.<ref name=Merry129130>Merry, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> The issue of slavery became increasingly polarizing during the 1840s, and Polk's expansionary policies increased its divisiveness.<ref name=Merry129130/> During his presidency, many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the \"[[Slave Power]]\", and claimed that spreading slavery was the reason he supported Texas Annexation and later war with Mexico.<ref>Haynes, p. 154</ref> Polk did support the expansion of slavery's realm, with his views informed by his own family's experience of settling Tennessee, bringing slaves with them.<ref>Dusinberre, pp. 132\u2013133</ref> He believed in Southern rights, meaning both the right of slave states not to have that institution interfered with by the Federal government, and the right of individual Southerners to bring their slaves with them into the new territory.<ref>Dusinberre, p. 146</ref> Though Polk opposed the Wilmot Proviso, he also condemned southern agitation on the issue, and he accused both northern and southern leaders of attempting to use the slavery issue for political gain.<ref name=merry356358>Merry, pp. 356\u2013358</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2017, new tombstones for three of his slaves, Elias Polk, Mary Polk and Matilda Polk, were placed in the [[Nashville City Cemetery]].

[[Sam Houston]] is said to have observed that Polk, a teetotaler, was \"a victim of the use of water as a beverage\".<ref>Borneman, p. 11.</ref> Little was published about him but two biographies released in the wake of his death. Polk was not again the subject of a major biography until 1922, when Eugene I. McCormac published ''James K. Polk: A Political Biography''. McCormac relied heavily on Polk's presidential diary, first published in 1909.<ref>Borneman, p. 352</ref> When historians began ranking the presidents in 1948, Polk ranked 10th in [[Arthur M.

Calabresi]] and [[Christopher S.

Truman]] called Polk \"a great president. Said what he intended to do and did it.\"<ref>Truman & Ferrell, p. 390.</ref> Bergeron noted that the matters that Polk settled, he settled for his time. The questions of the banking system, and of the tariff, which Polk had made two of the main issues of his presidency, were not significantly revised until the 1860s. Similarly, the Gadsden Purchase, and [[Alaska Purchase|that of Alaska]] (1867), were the only major U.S. expansions until the 1890s.<ref name  = \"bergeron261\" />\n\nPaul H.
