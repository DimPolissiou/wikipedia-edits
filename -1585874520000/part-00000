American toy manufacturer [[Hasbro]]. Based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, the company is primarily involved in the acquisition, distribution, and production of films, music, and television series. The company was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] until it was acquired by Hasbro in December 2019.\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nThe company has its origins in the music distributor Records on Wheels (which was established in 1970), and the music retail chain CD Plus. The chain was in the process of acquiring other companies to bolster its wholesale operations in music and home video, leading to its purchase of ROW in 2001.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/cd-plus-links-up-with-records-on-wheels/article25573728/|title=CD Plus links up with Records On Wheels|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> Its vice president of operations, [[Darren Throop]], had joined the company after CD Plus acquired his Halifax-based record store chain Urban Sound Exchange. The combined company later became known as ROW Entertainment, with Throop as president and CEO.

Prior to the massacre, four to five thousand students from various universities had demonstrated for more than a week against the return of former military dictator [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] to Thailand from [[Singapore]].\n\nA day before the massacre, the Thai press reported on a play staged by student protesters the previous day, which allegedly featured the mock hanging of then [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn]]. In response to this rumored outrage, military and police, as well as paramilitary forces surrounded the university. Just before dawn on 6 October with the protesters trapped within the campus, the government forces opened fire on them. The brutal attack lasted until noon, eventually devolving into chaos with mob beatings, rapes and lynchings. To this day, the number of casualties remains in dispute between the Thai government and survivors of the massacre. According to the government, 46 died in the killings, with 167 wounded and 3,000 arrested.

Thanin and his cabinet restored the repressive climate which had existed before 1973.<ref name=\"Mallet\" />{{RP|91}}\n\n== Significance ==\n\n=== Return of bureaucratic polity ===\nFor forty years from 1932 when the absolute monarchy was abolished, until 1973 when military rule was overthrown in favor of democracy, military officers and civil servants held sway in Thai politics and dominated the government, with King Bhumibol serving as the ceremonial head of state in accordance with his role as a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]] established by the 1932 constitution. The Thai political system was known as a \"bureaucratic [[polity]]\" which was dominated by the military and civilian bureaucrats.<ref>Riggs, Fred (1976). \"The Bureaucratic Polity as a Working System\". In Clark Neher, ed., ''Thailand: From Village to Nation''. Cambridge: Schenkman Books, pp. 406-424.</ref> The massacre disproved the argument that the bureaucratic polity was on the retreat as the military came to play a central role once more in Thai politics, a situation that would continue throughout the 1970s and 1980s until the [[1988 Thai general election|1988 general election]] when all seats were democratically elected, including that of the prime minister, who from 1976 to 1988 was appointed by the king.\n\n=== Withdrawal symptoms ===\nFollowing in the footsteps of previous military strongmen like [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] and [[Sarit Thanarat]], Thanom became prime minister in 1963 following Sarit's death. He oversaw a massive influx of financial aid from the United States and Japan, fuelling the Thai economy, as well as increasing American cultural influence. But by the early-1970s, the US was withdrawing its troops from Indochina. In such a context, the Thai middle class and lower-middle class who had supported student efforts in 1973 to topple the Thanom regime were more a product of their immediate history than devotees of democracy.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Ben|title=Withdrawal Symptoms: Social and Cultural Aspects of the October 6 Coup|journal=Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars|date=Jul\u2013Sep 1977|volume=9|issue=3|pages=13\u201318|url=http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106234159/http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{RP|18}} They lacked political experience and so had no real idea of the consequences of ending the dictatorship. The regime was simultaneously blamed both for failing to exact fuller commitments from its allies and for excessive subservience to Washington.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />{{RP|18}} The support given by the Thai middle class and lower-middle class to the 1973 student protests was not an unconditional stamp of approval for democratic processes and the chaos that followed. The \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976 was seen as having threatened the economic interests of the middle class and lower-middle class who favored stability and peace above democracy. In light of this, while they supported the mass demonstrations against the Thanom regime leading up to the uprising on 14 October 1973, they turned their backs on democracy, hence Anderson's use of the phrase \"withdrawal symptoms\", and welcomed the return to dictatorship on 6 October 1976, heralding the end of the period of chaotic democracy.\n\n== Left-wing Conspiracy Theory ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017|reason=first paragraph has no citations}}\nDespite being the most popular assumption among left-wing scholars, there are not empirical evidences which concluded that King Bhumibol had supported student protesters in their demonstrations in 1973 that led to the downfall of the Thanom regime and resulted in the period of \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976, but had turned against the students and played a crucial, if not the most important, role in bringing about the massacre and a return to military rule after a three-year flirtation with democracy.\n\nAccording to the conspiracy theory, \u201cthere were two reasons for this about-face.\u201d \u201cFirst, Thailand's neighbors either were facing communist insurgencies or had fallen to communist rule and become communist countries.\u201d \u201cThe US was withdrawing its military presence from the region. The pivotal year in the trajectory of the king's involvement in politics was 1975. [[South Vietnam]] fell to the communists and the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] was able to unify the country under its rule and drive out the US. In Cambodia, the communist [[Khmer Rouge]] [[Fall of Phnom Penh|captured Phnom Penh]] and began a reign of terror that would only end in 1979. The 1975 incident that arguably shook the Thai monarchy to the core was the overthrow by the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] of the [[Lao Royal Family]], to which the Thai monarchy traditionally had cultural and historical ties. Second, the period of chaotic democracy brought instability and chaos as demonstrations, strikes, and protests took place much more frequently. They threatened the economic interests of the monarchy managed by the [[Crown Property Bureau]], which favored a stable and peaceful economic environment that would allow its businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Bhumibol wielded his influence through a \"[[network monarchy]]\" that was centered on [[Privy Council of Thailand|Privy Council]] President [[Prem Tinsulanonda]]. One of the main features of the network monarchy was that the monarch intervened actively in political developments, largely by working through proxies such as privy councillors and trusted military figures.<ref>McCargo, Duncan (2005). \"Network Monarchy and Legitimacy Crises\". ''The Pacific Review'', Vol. 18, No. 4, p. 501.</ref> This network monarchy suggests that, contrary to the popular belief that the king was a constitutional monarch and above politics, rather he had been intimately involved in Thai politics and had often intervened in order to secure his political and economic interests. The instability brought about by the student protesters until 1976 as well as the growing specter of communist threat in the region, especially after the \"domino effect\" where Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fell in succession to the communists, convinced King Bhumibol to see the protesters as a threat to his rule. The Thai state and its politicians subsequently branded these students, as well as workers and farmers, as \"communists\" and a \"fifth column for the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] (CPT) and [[North Vietnam]].\"<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} In reality, there was little evidence for the claim that protesters, including students protesting at Thammasat University, were communists. While the CPT had grown in strength, they were far from a unified force and they appealed to peasants by focusing on social injustices while avoiding attacking the monarchy and Buddhism. Their gains were fuelled more by the government's alienation of the peasantry.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} This suggests that the term \"communists\" was applied very liberally and indiscriminately and more often than not, deliberately, to those who were deemed to be the sources of instability that threatened the monarchy and the king. In the Thai state's view, communism was simply the enemy of the nation, religion (Buddhism), and monarchy, and a sworn enemy of \"Thainess\".<ref name=Thongchai-1994>Winichakul, Thongchai (1994). ''Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of Siam''.

This culminated in the Thammasat massacre.\u201d\n\n=== Village Scouts ===\n\u201cThe Village Scouts organization was a national [[paramilitary]] group sponsored by the King and Queen of Thailand since 1972 in order to promote national unity against threats to Thai independence and freedom, particularly against \"communism\".<ref name=Muecke>Muecke, Marjorie (1980). \"The Village Scouts of Thailand\". ''Asian Survey'', Vol. 20, No. 4.</ref>{{RP|407}} The movement was set up explicitly to protect the monarchy from communism. It focused on the central features of Thai identity: love of play, deep respect for the king and religion (Buddhism), and for ethnic Thai \"specialness\".<ref name=\"Muecke\" />{{RP|413}} The king was held to be central to the Thai nation, to be protected at all costs, alongside the nation and religion, forming the Thai nationalist [[shibboleth]], \"nation, religion, king\". The Village Scouts presence provided continuous proof of militant political support for nation-religion-king beyond the Bangkok upper classes, among the \"establishments\" of provincial capitals, small towns, and villages. It helped to legitimize private, localized repression of protesting peasants and student activists as essential for the preservation the status quo.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> During the period 1973\u20131976, Village Scout membership rose to tens of thousands, almost all in rural, CPT-influenced Thailand. After an [[Internal Security Operations Command]] (ISOC) takeover, the Village Scouts metamorphosed into a [[fascist]]-style mass political movement that would play a major role in the ensuing massacre.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|224}}\u201d\n\n=== Nawaphon ===\n\u201c[[Nawaphon]] was an ISOC operation organized in 1974. It was composed of mainly low-level government functionaries and clerks, rural village and communal headmen, as well as a number of monks.<ref name=Keyes>Keyes, Charles (1978). \"Political Crisis and Militant Buddhism in Contemporary Thailand\". In Bardwell L. Smith, ed., ''Religion and Legitimation of Power in Thailand, Laos, and Burma''. Chambersburg: Anima Books.</ref>{{RP|151}} The name \"Nawaphon\" means \"nine strengths\", a reference to either the [[Chakri dynasty|Chakri Ninth Reign (King Bhumibol)]]<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} or the nine points of Nawaphon's program to preserve Thai nationalism.<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|151}} The aim of Nawaphon was to protect the king from threats like communism. A key figure of the movement was the monk, Kittivudho Bhikkhu, who became its leader in 1975. In a June 1976 interview he was asked if killing leftists or communists would produce demerits or negative [[karma]], he said that such killing would not be demeriting because, \"...whoever destroys the nation, the religion or the monarchy, such bestial types are not complete persons. Thus, we must intend not to kill people but to kill the Devil; this is the duty of all Thai\".<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|153}} In 1967, he established Jittiphawan College. It was inaugurated by King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit who returned regularly even after Kittivudho began to make incendiary speeches about the need to deal with student protesters and communists.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} This suggests a close relationship between the Nawaphon movement and the royal family. Employing the slogan that \"killing communists is not demeritorious\", Kittivudho encouraged the killings of alleged communists from 1973 to 1976 and injected militant Buddhism into the Thai [[body politic]], eventually inciting his followers to commit violence at Thammasat University on 6 October. Earlier, Nawaphon was responsible for the killing of more than 20 prominent farmer activists in 1975.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|226}} The murders were an attempt to negate the farmers' new-found political agency and, by so doing, return them to their pre-October 1973 state of relative repression.<ref>Haberkorn, Tyrell (2009). \"An Unfinished Past: Assassination and the 1974 Land Rent Control Act in Northern Thailand\". ''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 28.</ref> The assassinations of farmer activists were part of the state campaign to suppress any potential threat to the king's rule, sanctioned and encouraged by the king as an integral part of his anti-communist purge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\u201d\n\n=== Red Gaurs ===\n\u201cThe [[Red Gaurs]] were ex-mercenaries and men discharged from the military for disciplinary infractions mixed with unemployed vocational school graduates, high-school dropouts, idle street corner boys, and slum toughs.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> In the early-1970s, potential recruits were in dire economic straits, unable to obtain employment, and thus were easy targets of anti-student and anti-worker propaganda.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Their grievances were exploited by the state, notably the king's network, and their anger directed towards student protesters. They were recruited not on the basis of ideological commitment, but rather by promises of high pay, abundant liquor, brothel privileges, and the lure of public notoriety.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Unlike the Village Scouts and the Nawaphon, the motivation of the Red Gaurs was more sociological than ideological.\u201d\n\n=== Royal family involvement ===\n\u201cKing Bhumibol and the royal family took part frequently in Village Scout activities and attended ceremonies at Kittivudho's college and Red Gaur training camps, thus illustrating their close ties with these three paramilitary forces.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|227}} While all three forces differed in their nature, they were united by their allegiance to the king and, concomitantly, their hatred of communists. These paramilitary forces would subsequently be mobilized to attack the student protesters at Thammasat University to end their weeks-long protests.\u201d\n\n== Remembrance ==\nAccording to Ron Corben, the Thammasat University massacre continues to be a \"...scar on the Thai collective psyche...\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Corben|first1=Ron|title=Thailand to Mark 40th Anniversary of Bloody 1976 Massacre|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=VOA News|date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005162257/http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The government has remained silent over its role, and that of the king, in the killing of student protesters.

There has been no state investigation into the violence and this impunity is both cause and effect of the silence, ambivalence, and ambiguity surrounding the event for both those who survived it and Thai society.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|46}}\n\nThai scholar [[Thongchai Winichakul]], one of the student protesters who was jailed for his participation in the protests at Thammasat University, argues that the clearest evidence of the evasive public memories of the uprisings and massacre are the names the events have come to be known by, and the most conspicuous site of contested memories is the controversy over the memorial for the events.<ref name=Thongchai-2002>Thongchai Winichakul (2002). \"Remembering/ Silencing the Traumatic Past\". In Shigeharu Tanabe and Charles F. Keyes eds., ''Cultural Crisis and Social Memory: Modernity and Identity in Thailand and Laos''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press.</ref>{{RP|265}} The massacre continues to be known in Thailand by the deliberately ambiguous term \"6 October event\". Thongchai argues that this non-committal name is loaded with many unsettled meanings, which imply the absence of any commitment and obscures the past because it is too heavily loaded with contesting voices, placing the massacre on the edge between recognizability and anonymity, between history and the silenced past, and between memory and forgetfulness.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|266}} Thus, in \"remembering\" it, its nomenclature carries overt political significance that continues to reverberate in present-day Thai politics, particularly in relation to the role played by the state and King Bhumibol in the attack on student protesters.\n\nThe commemoration in 1996 represented a significant break in the silence. Yet, during the commemoration, what happened twenty years earlier was retold innumerable times, though without any reference to the undiscussable parts of that history.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} There was also no reaction, not even any comment, from the military or any conservative organization.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} More importantly, the denunciation of state crime avoided imputing blame to any specific individual and the victims' self-sacrifice for society's sake was honored.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274-275}} The role played by King Bhumibol in inciting the military and police and paramilitary forces to attack the student protesters was not mentioned so as not to target the king as an \"individual\". Yet, this could also be interpreted as an attempt by the state to whitewash history by wishing away parts that it did not want the public to know or remember. In addition, by emphasizing the theme of healing and reconciliation in the remembrance, the Thai state, and by implication the king, have sought to make clear that the commemoration had no interest in and would not be involved in any talk of [[wikt:retribution|retribution]].<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37520961 BBC News interview with Thongchai Winichakul]\n\n{{Thammasat University}}\n{{Thai coups}}\n{{History of Thailand since 1973}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thammasat University Massacre}}\n[[Category:1976 in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in 1976]]\n[[Category:Massacres in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Political repression in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Protests in Thailand]]\n[[Category:School massacres]]\n[[Category:Thammasat University]]\n[[Category:History of Bangkok]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Thailand]]\n[[Category:October 1976 events in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title       = Thammasat University massacre\n| image       = File:6 \u0e15\u0e38\u0e25\u0e32.jpg\n| location    = [[Thammasat University]] and [[Sanam Luang]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]\n| coordinates = {{Coord|13|45|21.07|N|100|29|27.16|E|region:TH_type:edu|display=inline, title}}\n| target      = Student protesters\n| date        = 6 October 1976\n| fatalities  = 46 (official); 100+ (unofficial)\n| injuries    = 167 (official)\n| perps       = [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]]<br/>[[Royal Thai Police]]<br/>[[Village Scouts]]<br/>[[Nawaphon]]<br/>[[Red Gaur]]<br/>Pro Government Civilians\n}}\n\nThe '''Thammasat University massacre''' (in Thailand known simply as '''the 6 October event''', {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e15\u0e38\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c 6 \u0e15\u0e38\u0e25\u0e32}} {{RTGS|het kan hok tula}}) was an attack by Thai state forces and far-right paramilitaries on student protesters on the campus of [[Thammasat University]] and the adjacent [[Sanam Luang]] Square in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], on 6 October 1976. Prior to the massacre, four to five thousand students from various universities had demonstrated for more than a week against the return of former military dictator [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] to Thailand from [[Singapore]].\n\nA day before the massacre, the Thai press reported on a play staged by student protesters the previous day, which allegedly featured the mock hanging of then [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn]]. In response to this rumored outrage, military and police, as well as paramilitary forces surrounded the university. Just before dawn on 6 October with the protesters trapped within the campus, the government forces opened fire on them. The brutal attack lasted until noon, eventually devolving into chaos with mob beatings, rapes and lynchings.

The Thai political system was known as a \"bureaucratic [[polity]]\" which was dominated by the military and civilian bureaucrats.<ref>Riggs, Fred (1976). \"The Bureaucratic Polity as a Working System\". In Clark Neher, ed., ''Thailand: From Village to Nation''. Cambridge: Schenkman Books, pp. 406-424.</ref> The massacre disproved the argument that the bureaucratic polity was on the retreat as the military came to play a central role once more in Thai politics, a situation that would continue throughout the 1970s and 1980s until the [[1988 Thai general election|1988 general election]] when all seats were democratically elected, including that of the prime minister, who from 1976 to 1988 was appointed by the king.\n\n=== Withdrawal symptoms ===\nFollowing in the footsteps of previous military strongmen like [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] and [[Sarit Thanarat]], Thanom became prime minister in 1963 following Sarit's death. He oversaw a massive influx of financial aid from the United States and Japan, fuelling the Thai economy, as well as increasing American cultural influence. But by the early-1970s, the US was withdrawing its troops from Indochina. In such a context, the Thai middle class and lower-middle class who had supported student efforts in 1973 to topple the Thanom regime were more a product of their immediate history than devotees of democracy.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Ben|title=Withdrawal Symptoms: Social and Cultural Aspects of the October 6 Coup|journal=Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars|date=Jul\u2013Sep 1977|volume=9|issue=3|pages=13\u201318|url=http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106234159/http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v09n03.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{RP|18}} They lacked political experience and so had no real idea of the consequences of ending the dictatorship. The regime was simultaneously blamed both for failing to exact fuller commitments from its allies and for excessive subservience to Washington.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />{{RP|18}} The support given by the Thai middle class and lower-middle class to the 1973 student protests was not an unconditional stamp of approval for democratic processes and the chaos that followed. The \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976 was seen as having threatened the economic interests of the middle class and lower-middle class who favored stability and peace above democracy. In light of this, while they supported the mass demonstrations against the Thanom regime leading up to the uprising on 14 October 1973, they turned their backs on democracy, hence Anderson's use of the phrase \"withdrawal symptoms\", and welcomed the return to dictatorship on 6 October 1976, heralding the end of the period of chaotic democracy.\n\n== Left-wing Conspiracy Theory ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017|reason=first paragraph has no citations}}\nDespite being the most popular assumption among left-wing scholars, there are not empirical evidences which concluded that King Bhumibol had supported student protesters in their demonstrations in 1973 that led to the downfall of the Thanom regime and resulted in the period of \"chaotic democracy\" from 1973 to 1976, but had turned against the students and played a crucial, if not the most important, role in bringing about the massacre and a return to military rule after a three-year flirtation with democracy.\n\nAccording to the conspiracy theory, \u201cthere were two reasons for this about-face.\u201d \u201cFirst, Thailand's neighbors either were facing communist insurgencies or had fallen to communist rule and become communist countries.\u201d \u201cThe US was withdrawing its military presence from the region. The pivotal year in the trajectory of the king's involvement in politics was 1975. [[South Vietnam]] fell to the communists and the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] was able to unify the country under its rule and drive out the US. In Cambodia, the communist [[Khmer Rouge]] [[Fall of Phnom Penh|captured Phnom Penh]] and began a reign of terror that would only end in 1979. The 1975 incident that arguably shook the Thai monarchy to the core was the overthrow by the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] of the [[Lao Royal Family]], to which the Thai monarchy traditionally had cultural and historical ties. Second, the period of chaotic democracy brought instability and chaos as demonstrations, strikes, and protests took place much more frequently. They threatened the economic interests of the monarchy managed by the [[Crown Property Bureau]], which favored a stable and peaceful economic environment that would allow its businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Bhumibol wielded his influence through a \"[[network monarchy]]\" that was centered on [[Privy Council of Thailand|Privy Council]] President [[Prem Tinsulanonda]]. One of the main features of the network monarchy was that the monarch intervened actively in political developments, largely by working through proxies such as privy councillors and trusted military figures.<ref>McCargo, Duncan (2005). \"Network Monarchy and Legitimacy Crises\". ''The Pacific Review'', Vol. 18, No. 4, p. 501.</ref> This network monarchy suggests that, contrary to the popular belief that the king was a constitutional monarch and above politics, rather he had been intimately involved in Thai politics and had often intervened in order to secure his political and economic interests. The instability brought about by the student protesters until 1976 as well as the growing specter of communist threat in the region, especially after the \"domino effect\" where Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fell in succession to the communists, convinced King Bhumibol to see the protesters as a threat to his rule. The Thai state and its politicians subsequently branded these students, as well as workers and farmers, as \"communists\" and a \"fifth column for the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] (CPT) and [[North Vietnam]].\"<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} In reality, there was little evidence for the claim that protesters, including students protesting at Thammasat University, were communists. While the CPT had grown in strength, they were far from a unified force and they appealed to peasants by focusing on social injustices while avoiding attacking the monarchy and Buddhism. Their gains were fuelled more by the government's alienation of the peasantry.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|220}} This suggests that the term \"communists\" was applied very liberally and indiscriminately and more often than not, deliberately, to those who were deemed to be the sources of instability that threatened the monarchy and the king. In the Thai state's view, communism was simply the enemy of the nation, religion (Buddhism), and monarchy, and a sworn enemy of \"Thainess\".<ref name=Thongchai-1994>Winichakul, Thongchai (1994). ''Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of Siam''. Honolulu: University of Hawai\u2019i Press.</ref>{{RP|169-170}} One of the more persistent counterinsurgency strategies was to link socialists, communists, and the Left to external threats.<ref name=\"Thongchai-1994\" />{{RP|169-170}} In order to deal effectively with the \"communist\" threat that would undermine his rule and status, in addition to deploying governmental forces such as the Thai military and police, King Bhumibol, through his network monarchy, also encouraged three paramilitary forces\u2014the Village Scouts, Nawaphon, and Red Gaurs\u2014to use violence against protesters from 1973 to 1976. This culminated in the Thammasat massacre.\u201d\n\n=== Village Scouts ===\n\u201cThe Village Scouts organization was a national [[paramilitary]] group sponsored by the King and Queen of Thailand since 1972 in order to promote national unity against threats to Thai independence and freedom, particularly against \"communism\".<ref name=Muecke>Muecke, Marjorie (1980). \"The Village Scouts of Thailand\". ''Asian Survey'', Vol. 20, No. 4.</ref>{{RP|407}} The movement was set up explicitly to protect the monarchy from communism. It focused on the central features of Thai identity: love of play, deep respect for the king and religion (Buddhism), and for ethnic Thai \"specialness\".<ref name=\"Muecke\" />{{RP|413}} The king was held to be central to the Thai nation, to be protected at all costs, alongside the nation and religion, forming the Thai nationalist [[shibboleth]], \"nation, religion, king\". The Village Scouts presence provided continuous proof of militant political support for nation-religion-king beyond the Bangkok upper classes, among the \"establishments\" of provincial capitals, small towns, and villages. It helped to legitimize private, localized repression of protesting peasants and student activists as essential for the preservation the status quo.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> During the period 1973\u20131976, Village Scout membership rose to tens of thousands, almost all in rural, CPT-influenced Thailand. After an [[Internal Security Operations Command]] (ISOC) takeover, the Village Scouts metamorphosed into a [[fascist]]-style mass political movement that would play a major role in the ensuing massacre.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|224}}\u201d\n\n=== Nawaphon ===\n\u201c[[Nawaphon]] was an ISOC operation organized in 1974. It was composed of mainly low-level government functionaries and clerks, rural village and communal headmen, as well as a number of monks.<ref name=Keyes>Keyes, Charles (1978). \"Political Crisis and Militant Buddhism in Contemporary Thailand\". In Bardwell L. Smith, ed., ''Religion and Legitimation of Power in Thailand, Laos, and Burma''. Chambersburg: Anima Books.</ref>{{RP|151}} The name \"Nawaphon\" means \"nine strengths\", a reference to either the [[Chakri dynasty|Chakri Ninth Reign (King Bhumibol)]]<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} or the nine points of Nawaphon's program to preserve Thai nationalism.<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|151}} The aim of Nawaphon was to protect the king from threats like communism. A key figure of the movement was the monk, Kittivudho Bhikkhu, who became its leader in 1975. In a June 1976 interview he was asked if killing leftists or communists would produce demerits or negative [[karma]], he said that such killing would not be demeriting because, \"...whoever destroys the nation, the religion or the monarchy, such bestial types are not complete persons. Thus, we must intend not to kill people but to kill the Devil; this is the duty of all Thai\".<ref name=\"Keyes\" />{{RP|153}} In 1967, he established Jittiphawan College. It was inaugurated by King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit who returned regularly even after Kittivudho began to make incendiary speeches about the need to deal with student protesters and communists.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|225}} This suggests a close relationship between the Nawaphon movement and the royal family. Employing the slogan that \"killing communists is not demeritorious\", Kittivudho encouraged the killings of alleged communists from 1973 to 1976 and injected militant Buddhism into the Thai [[body politic]], eventually inciting his followers to commit violence at Thammasat University on 6 October. Earlier, Nawaphon was responsible for the killing of more than 20 prominent farmer activists in 1975.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|226}} The murders were an attempt to negate the farmers' new-found political agency and, by so doing, return them to their pre-October 1973 state of relative repression.<ref>Haberkorn, Tyrell (2009). \"An Unfinished Past: Assassination and the 1974 Land Rent Control Act in Northern Thailand\". ''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 28.</ref> The assassinations of farmer activists were part of the state campaign to suppress any potential threat to the king's rule, sanctioned and encouraged by the king as an integral part of his anti-communist purge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\u201d\n\n=== Red Gaurs ===\n\u201cThe [[Red Gaurs]] were ex-mercenaries and men discharged from the military for disciplinary infractions mixed with unemployed vocational school graduates, high-school dropouts, idle street corner boys, and slum toughs.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> In the early-1970s, potential recruits were in dire economic straits, unable to obtain employment, and thus were easy targets of anti-student and anti-worker propaganda.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Their grievances were exploited by the state, notably the king's network, and their anger directed towards student protesters. They were recruited not on the basis of ideological commitment, but rather by promises of high pay, abundant liquor, brothel privileges, and the lure of public notoriety.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Unlike the Village Scouts and the Nawaphon, the motivation of the Red Gaurs was more sociological than ideological.\u201d\n\n=== Royal family involvement ===\n\u201cKing Bhumibol and the royal family took part frequently in Village Scout activities and attended ceremonies at Kittivudho's college and Red Gaur training camps, thus illustrating their close ties with these three paramilitary forces.<ref name=\"Handley-2006\" />{{RP|227}} While all three forces differed in their nature, they were united by their allegiance to the king and, concomitantly, their hatred of communists. These paramilitary forces would subsequently be mobilized to attack the student protesters at Thammasat University to end their weeks-long protests.\u201d\n\n== Remembrance ==\nAccording to Ron Corben, the Thammasat University massacre continues to be a \"...scar on the Thai collective psyche...\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Corben|first1=Ron|title=Thailand to Mark 40th Anniversary of Bloody 1976 Massacre|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=VOA News|date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005162257/http://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-mark-40th-anniversary-of-1976-massacre/3537620.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The government has remained silent over its role, and that of the king, in the killing of student protesters.

''Critical Asian Studies'', Vol. 47, No. 1.</ref>{{RP|47}} The first amnesty law, passed on 24 December 1976, legalized the coup and prevented those who seized power on the evening of 6 October from being held accountable.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|44}} The second amnesty law, passed on 16 September 1978, freed eighteen student activists still undergoing criminal prosecution and dismissed the charges against them.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|44}} The \"hidden transcripts\" of the two amnesties for massacre and coup that followed reveal the careful, calculated legal moves taken to protect those who were behind them.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|64}} Despite the rhetoric in the streets and on the radio about the need to protect the nation, the coup and the massacre that preceded it unsettled some inside the state, perhaps because they were aware of the extra-legal status of the massacre, perhaps because they worried about their own culpability, and perhaps because they were aware that the violations in need of amnesty were not only those of the criminal code but of the more basic code of being human.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|64-65}} Thus, both amnesty laws sought to produce impunity for state violence, particularly the king's involvement. There has been no state investigation into the violence and this impunity is both cause and effect of the silence, ambivalence, and ambiguity surrounding the event for both those who survived it and Thai society.<ref name=\"Haberkorn-2015\" />{{RP|46}}\n\nThai scholar [[Thongchai Winichakul]], one of the student protesters who was jailed for his participation in the protests at Thammasat University, argues that the clearest evidence of the evasive public memories of the uprisings and massacre are the names the events have come to be known by, and the most conspicuous site of contested memories is the controversy over the memorial for the events.<ref name=Thongchai-2002>Thongchai Winichakul (2002). \"Remembering/ Silencing the Traumatic Past\". In Shigeharu Tanabe and Charles F. Keyes eds., ''Cultural Crisis and Social Memory: Modernity and Identity in Thailand and Laos''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press.</ref>{{RP|265}} The massacre continues to be known in Thailand by the deliberately ambiguous term \"6 October event\". Thongchai argues that this non-committal name is loaded with many unsettled meanings, which imply the absence of any commitment and obscures the past because it is too heavily loaded with contesting voices, placing the massacre on the edge between recognizability and anonymity, between history and the silenced past, and between memory and forgetfulness.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|266}} Thus, in \"remembering\" it, its nomenclature carries overt political significance that continues to reverberate in present-day Thai politics, particularly in relation to the role played by the state and King Bhumibol in the attack on student protesters.\n\nThe commemoration in 1996 represented a significant break in the silence. Yet, during the commemoration, what happened twenty years earlier was retold innumerable times, though without any reference to the undiscussable parts of that history.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} There was also no reaction, not even any comment, from the military or any conservative organization.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}} More importantly, the denunciation of state crime avoided imputing blame to any specific individual and the victims' self-sacrifice for society's sake was honored.<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274-275}} The role played by King Bhumibol in inciting the military and police and paramilitary forces to attack the student protesters was not mentioned so as not to target the king as an \"individual\". Yet, this could also be interpreted as an attempt by the state to whitewash history by wishing away parts that it did not want the public to know or remember. In addition, by emphasizing the theme of healing and reconciliation in the remembrance, the Thai state, and by implication the king, have sought to make clear that the commemoration had no interest in and would not be involved in any talk of [[wikt:retribution|retribution]].<ref name=\"Thongchai-2002\" />{{RP|274}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37520961 BBC News interview with Thongchai Winichakul]\n\n{{Thammasat University}}\n{{Thai coups}}\n{{History of Thailand since 1973}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thammasat University Massacre}}\n[[Category:1976 in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Mass murder in 1976]]\n[[Category:Massacres in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Political repression in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Protests in Thailand]]\n[[Category:School massacres]]\n[[Category:Thammasat University]]\n[[Category:History of Bangkok]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Thailand]]\n[[Category:October 1976 events in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Bluishnat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eImmediate causes:it seems that the date here is wrong - finding sources that mentioned the 24th of October as the day that the two activists were hung rather than it being on the 25th.

The city permitted Austin Peay to use the stadium for an annual sum which was thought to be the actual cost to the city.  The city maintained its ownership and operation of the Municipal Stadium until 1970. In that year, as a result of a cooperative agreement between Austin Peay, the county officials and the city officials, the city conveyed title to one-third of the stadium to the [[Tennessee|State of Tennessee]] for the university.  The other one-third went to [[Montgomery County, Tennessee|Montgomery County]]. Following the 1993 season, the University agreed to purchase Municipal Stadium from the Stadium Authority and Montgomery County. With the purchase, the University installed a new playing surface and, more importantly, changed the name of the facility to '''Governors Stadium'''.\n\nAustin Peay, Montgomery County, and the city of Clarksville were authorized to appropriate funds to the newly created Stadium Authority for constructing, remodeling and operating the stadium.

The city permitted Austin Peay to use the stadium for an annual sum which was thought to be the actual cost to the city.  The city maintained its ownership and operation of the Municipal Stadium until 1970. In that year, as a result of a cooperative agreement between Austin Peay, the county officials and the city officials, the city conveyed title to one-third of the stadium to the [[Tennessee|State of Tennessee]] for the university.  The other one-third went to [[Montgomery County, Tennessee|Montgomery County]]. Following the 1993 season, the University agreed to purchase Municipal Stadium from the Stadium Authority and Montgomery County. With the purchase, the University installed a new playing surface and, more importantly, changed the name of the facility to '''Governors Stadium'''.\n\nAustin Peay, Montgomery County, and the city of Clarksville were authorized to appropriate funds to the newly created Stadium Authority for constructing, remodeling and operating the stadium. The members of the Stadium Authority were to be appointed by the county and by the university.\n\nIn April 2016, Fortera Credit Union earned naming rights to Governors Stadium.

When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry.\n\n==Overview==\n\nIn [[explicit symmetry breaking]], if we consider two outcomes, the probability of a pair of outcomes can be different.  By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of a symmetric probability distribution\u2014any pair of outcomes has the same probability.  In other words, the underlying laws{{clarify|date=December 2016}} are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under a [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] transformation.\n\nThe system, as a whole{{clarify|date=December 2016}}, changes under such transformations.\n\nPhases of matter, such as crystals, magnets, and conventional superconductors, as well as simple phase transitions can be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Notable exceptions include topological phases of matter like the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Mexican hat potential===\n[[Image:Mexican hat potential polar.svg|270px|thumb|Graph of Goldstone's \"Mexican hat\" potential function <math>V(\\phi)</math>.]]\n\nConsider a symmetric upward dome with a trough circling the bottom. If a ball is put at the very peak of the dome, the system is symmetric with respect to a rotation around the center axis.

The system also has an unstable vacuum state corresponding to {{nowrap|1=''\u03a6'' = 0}}. This state has a [[Unitary group|U(1)]] symmetry. However, once the system falls into a specific stable vacuum state (amounting to a choice of ''\u03b8''), this symmetry will appear to be lost, or \"spontaneously broken\".\n\nIn fact, any other choice of ''\u03b8'' would have exactly the same energy, implying the existence of a massless [[Goldstone boson|Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson]], the mode running around the circle at the minimum of this potential, and indicating there is some memory of the original symmetry in the Lagrangian.\n\n===Other examples===\n* For [[ferromagnet]]ic materials, the underlying laws are invariant under spatial rotations. Here, the order parameter is the [[magnetization]], which measures the magnetic dipole density. Above the [[Curie temperature]], the order parameter is zero, which is spatially invariant, and there is no symmetry breaking. Below the Curie temperature, however, the magnetization acquires a constant nonvanishing value, which points in a certain direction (in the idealized situation where we have full equilibrium; otherwise, translational symmetry gets broken as well). The residual rotational symmetries which leave the orientation of this vector invariant remain unbroken, unlike the other rotations which do not and are thus spontaneously broken.\n* The laws describing a solid are invariant under the full [[Euclidean group]], but the solid itself spontaneously breaks this group down to a [[space group]]. The displacement and the orientation are the order parameters.\n* General relativity has a Lorentz symmetry, but in [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|FRW cosmological models]], the mean 4-velocity field defined by averaging over the velocities of the galaxies (the galaxies act like gas particles at cosmological scales) acts as an order parameter breaking this symmetry. Similar comments can be made about the cosmic microwave background.\n* For the [[electroweak]] model, as explained earlier, a component of the Higgs field provides the order parameter breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Like the ferromagnetic example, there is a phase transition at the electroweak temperature. The same comment about us not tending to notice broken symmetries suggests why it took so long for us to discover electroweak unification.\n* In superconductors, there is a condensed-matter collective field \u03c8, which acts as the order parameter breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.\n* Take a thin cylindrical plastic rod and push both ends together. Before buckling, the system is symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations in the direction of the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite [[Goldstone boson|Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson]].\n* Consider a uniform layer of [[fluid]] over an infinite horizontal plane. This system has all the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. But now heat the bottom surface uniformly so that it becomes much hotter than the upper surface. When the temperature gradient becomes large enough, [[convection cell]]s will form, breaking the Euclidean symmetry.\n* Consider a bead on a circular hoop that is rotated about a vertical [[diameter]]. As the [[rotational velocity]] is increased gradually from rest, the bead will initially stay at its initial [[equilibrium point]] at the bottom of the hoop (intuitively stable, lowest [[gravitational potential]]). At a certain critical rotational velocity, this point will become unstable and the bead will jump to one of two other newly created equilibria, [[equidistant]] from the center. Initially, the system is symmetric with respect to the diameter, yet after passing the critical velocity, the bead ends up in one of the two new equilibrium points, thus breaking the symmetry.\n\n==Spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics==\n[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking (explanatory diagram).png|thumb|right|250px|''Spontaneous symmetry breaking illustrated'': At high energy levels (''left'') the ball settles in the center, and the result is symmetric. At lower energy levels (''right''), the overall \"rules\" remain symmetric, but the symmetric  \"[[sombrero|Mexican hat]]\" enforces an asymmetric outcome, since eventually the ball must rest at some random spot on the bottom, \"spontaneously\", and not all others.]]\n\n===Particle physics===\nIn [[particle physics]] the [[force carrier]] particles are normally specified by field equations with [[gauge symmetry]]; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A ''by the same amount''. The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions.\n\nAn actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. \"Hidden\" is a better term than \"broken\", because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called [[Spontaneous magnetization|''spontaneous'']] symmetry breaking (SSB) because ''nothing'' (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations.<ref name=\"Weinberg2011\">{{cite book|author=Steven Weinberg|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rsg3PE_9_ccC|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78786-6}}</ref>{{rp|194\u2013195}}\n\n====Chiral symmetry====\n{{Main article|Chiral symmetry breaking}}\nChiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the [[chiral symmetry]] of the [[strong interactions]] in particle physics. It is a property of [[quantum chromodynamics]], the [[quantum field theory]] describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the [[nucleons]], and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound [[quarks]] into 100 times heavier constituents of [[baryons]]. The approximate [[Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson]]s in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the [[pions]], whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking.\n\n====Higgs mechanism====\n{{Main article|Higgs mechanism|Yukawa interaction}}\n\nThe strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]. The [[Higgs mechanism]], the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the [[superconductivity]] of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and ''gauge symmetries'', is that the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry does not give rise to characteristic massless Nambu\u2013Goldstone physical modes, but only massive modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics.\n\nIn the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the {{nowrap|SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)}} gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The [[W and Z bosons]] are the elementary particles that mediate the [[weak interaction]], while the [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. At energies much greater than 100 GeV all these particles behave in a similar manner. The [[Unified field theory#Modern progress|Weinberg\u2013Salam theory]] predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge.<ref>A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking, Bantam; 10th anniversary edition (1998). pp. 73\u201374.{{ISBN?}}</ref> In addition, fermions develop mass consistently.\n\nWithout spontaneous symmetry breaking, the [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the [[W and Z bosons]]) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the [[Higgs mechanism]] to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the [[Higgs boson]], detected in 2012.\n\n[[Superconductivity]] of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism.\n\n===Condensed matter physics===\nMost phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking [[rotational symmetry]]. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids and many others.\n\nThere are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter like [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall liquids]], and [[Quantum spin liquid|spin-liquids]]. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states.<ref name=chen>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys.

Below the [[Curie temperature]] the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization ''m''('''x''') such that {{nowrap|1=''m''('''x''') = \u2212''m''(\u2212'''x''')}}. The symmetry is spontaneously broken as {{nowrap|''h'' \u2192 0}} when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant.\n\nSpontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization.\n\nSpontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes associated with slow long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal's atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry-breaking  states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity.\n\nAn important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one-dimensional systems even at zero temperature (an important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations).\n\nOther long-range interacting systems such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the [[Coulomb potential]] or [[Yukawa potential]] has been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Kohlstedt |first=K.L.\n |last2=Vernizzi |first2=G.\n |last3=Solis |first3=F.J.\n |last4=Olvera de la Cruz |first4=M.\n |year=2007\n |title=Spontaneous Chirality via Long-range Electrostatic Forces\n |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n |volume=99 |issue=3\n |page=030602\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.030602\n|arxiv = 0704.3435 |bibcode = 2007PhRvL..99c0602K |pmid=17678276}}</ref> It was shown, in the presence of a symmetric Hamiltonian, and in the limit of infinite volume, the system spontaneously adopts a chiral configuration, i.e. breaks [[mirror plane]] [[symmetry]].\n\n===Dynamical symmetry breaking===\nDynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description ([[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]).\n\nDynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, that happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e. at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e. at the level of the [[effective action]]).\n\nDynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry {{ref|note1}} is subtler. In the conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists  an unstable [[Higgs particle]] in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (see e.g. [[Electroweak interaction]]). In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates  in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper which attempts to replace the conventional [[Higgs mechanism]] in the [[standard model]], by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks (such models, where a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as \"Composite Higgs models\").<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author1=William A.

Bardeen\n }}</ref> Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a [[fermionic condensate]]; for example the [[quark condensate]], which is connected to the [[Chiral symmetry breaking|dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Conventional [[superconductivity]] is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.\n\n==Generalisation and technical usage==\nFor spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed \"hidden symmetry\", and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the [[Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson|Goldstone boson]].)\n\nWhen a theory is symmetric with respect to a [[symmetry group]], but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate ''which'' member is distinct, only that ''one is''. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.\n\nThe crucial concept in physics theories is the [[order parameter]]. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a [[vacuum expectation value|''vacuum'' expectation value]]) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the [[ordered phase]], and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a \"frame of reference\" to be measured against. In that case, the [[vacuum state]] does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized  '''Wigner mode''' in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) '''Nambu\u2013Goldstone mode'''. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless [[Goldstone boson]]s arise.\n\nThe symmetry group can be discrete, such as the [[space group]] of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a [[Lie group]]), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a [[vacuum state]] of the full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry.\n\n==Nobel Prize==\nOn October 7, 2008, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awarded the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. [[Yoichiro Nambu]], of the [[University of Chicago]], won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically [[chiral symmetry breaking]].

Here, the order parameter is the [[magnetization]], which measures the magnetic dipole density. Above the [[Curie temperature]], the order parameter is zero, which is spatially invariant, and there is no symmetry breaking. Below the Curie temperature, however, the magnetization acquires a constant nonvanishing value, which points in a certain direction (in the idealized situation where we have full equilibrium; otherwise, translational symmetry gets broken as well). The residual rotational symmetries which leave the orientation of this vector invariant remain unbroken, unlike the other rotations which do not and are thus spontaneously broken.\n* The laws describing a solid are invariant under the full [[Euclidean group]], but the solid itself spontaneously breaks this group down to a [[space group]]. The displacement and the orientation are the order parameters.\n* General relativity has a Lorentz symmetry, but in [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|FRW cosmological models]], the mean 4-velocity field defined by averaging over the velocities of the galaxies (the galaxies act like gas particles at cosmological scales) acts as an order parameter breaking this symmetry. Similar comments can be made about the cosmic microwave background.\n* For the [[electroweak]] model, as explained earlier, a component of the Higgs field provides the order parameter breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Like the ferromagnetic example, there is a phase transition at the electroweak temperature. The same comment about us not tending to notice broken symmetries suggests why it took so long for us to discover electroweak unification.\n* In superconductors, there is a condensed-matter collective field \u03c8, which acts as the order parameter breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.\n* Take a thin cylindrical plastic rod and push both ends together. Before buckling, the system is symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations in the direction of the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite [[Goldstone boson|Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson]].\n* Consider a uniform layer of [[fluid]] over an infinite horizontal plane. This system has all the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. But now heat the bottom surface uniformly so that it becomes much hotter than the upper surface. When the temperature gradient becomes large enough, [[convection cell]]s will form, breaking the Euclidean symmetry.\n* Consider a bead on a circular hoop that is rotated about a vertical [[diameter]]. As the [[rotational velocity]] is increased gradually from rest, the bead will initially stay at its initial [[equilibrium point]] at the bottom of the hoop (intuitively stable, lowest [[gravitational potential]]). At a certain critical rotational velocity, this point will become unstable and the bead will jump to one of two other newly created equilibria, [[equidistant]] from the center. Initially, the system is symmetric with respect to the diameter, yet after passing the critical velocity, the bead ends up in one of the two new equilibrium points, thus breaking the symmetry.\n\n==Spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics==\n[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking (explanatory diagram).png|thumb|right|250px|''Spontaneous symmetry breaking illustrated'': At high energy levels (''left'') the ball settles in the center, and the result is symmetric. At lower energy levels (''right''), the overall \"rules\" remain symmetric, but the symmetric  \"[[sombrero|Mexican hat]]\" enforces an asymmetric outcome, since eventually the ball must rest at some random spot on the bottom, \"spontaneously\", and not all others.]]\n\n===Particle physics===\nIn [[particle physics]] the [[force carrier]] particles are normally specified by field equations with [[gauge symmetry]]; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A ''by the same amount''. The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions.\n\nAn actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. \"Hidden\" is a better term than \"broken\", because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called [[Spontaneous magnetization|''spontaneous'']] symmetry breaking (SSB) because ''nothing'' (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations.<ref name=\"Weinberg2011\">{{cite book|author=Steven Weinberg|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rsg3PE_9_ccC|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78786-6}}</ref>{{rp|194\u2013195}}\n\n====Chiral symmetry====\n{{Main article|Chiral symmetry breaking}}\nChiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the [[chiral symmetry]] of the [[strong interactions]] in particle physics. It is a property of [[quantum chromodynamics]], the [[quantum field theory]] describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the [[nucleons]], and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound [[quarks]] into 100 times heavier constituents of [[baryons]]. The approximate [[Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson]]s in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the [[pions]], whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking.\n\n====Higgs mechanism====\n{{Main article|Higgs mechanism|Yukawa interaction}}\n\nThe strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]. The [[Higgs mechanism]], the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the [[superconductivity]] of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and ''gauge symmetries'', is that the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry does not give rise to characteristic massless Nambu\u2013Goldstone physical modes, but only massive modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics.\n\nIn the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the {{nowrap|SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)}} gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The [[W and Z bosons]] are the elementary particles that mediate the [[weak interaction]], while the [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. At energies much greater than 100 GeV all these particles behave in a similar manner. The [[Unified field theory#Modern progress|Weinberg\u2013Salam theory]] predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge.<ref>A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking, Bantam; 10th anniversary edition (1998). pp. 73\u201374.{{ISBN?}}</ref> In addition, fermions develop mass consistently.\n\nWithout spontaneous symmetry breaking, the [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the [[W and Z bosons]]) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the [[Higgs mechanism]] to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the [[Higgs boson]], detected in 2012.\n\n[[Superconductivity]] of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism.\n\n===Condensed matter physics===\nMost phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking [[rotational symmetry]]. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids and many others.\n\nThere are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter like [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall liquids]], and [[Quantum spin liquid|spin-liquids]]. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states.<ref name=chen>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys.

Below the [[Curie temperature]] the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization ''m''('''x''') such that {{nowrap|1=''m''('''x''') = \u2212''m''(\u2212'''x''')}}. The symmetry is spontaneously broken as {{nowrap|''h'' \u2192 0}} when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant.\n\nSpontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization.\n\nSpontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes associated with slow long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal's atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry-breaking  states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity.\n\nAn important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one-dimensional systems even at zero temperature (an important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations).\n\nOther long-range interacting systems such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the [[Coulomb potential]] or [[Yukawa potential]] has been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Kohlstedt |first=K.L.\n |last2=Vernizzi |first2=G.\n |last3=Solis |first3=F.J.\n |last4=Olvera de la Cruz |first4=M.\n |year=2007\n |title=Spontaneous Chirality via Long-range Electrostatic Forces\n |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n |volume=99 |issue=3\n |page=030602\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.030602\n|arxiv = 0704.3435 |bibcode = 2007PhRvL..99c0602K |pmid=17678276}}</ref> It was shown, in the presence of a symmetric Hamiltonian, and in the limit of infinite volume, the system spontaneously adopts a chiral configuration, i.e. breaks [[mirror plane]] [[symmetry]].\n\n===Dynamical symmetry breaking===\nDynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description ([[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]).\n\nDynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, that happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e. at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e. at the level of the [[effective action]]).\n\nDynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry {{ref|note1}} is subtler. In the conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists  an unstable [[Higgs particle]] in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (see e.g. [[Electroweak interaction]]). In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates  in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper which attempts to replace the conventional [[Higgs mechanism]] in the [[standard model]], by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks (such models, where a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as \"Composite Higgs models\").<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author1=William A.

Bardeen\n }}</ref> Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a [[fermionic condensate]]; for example the [[quark condensate]], which is connected to the [[Chiral symmetry breaking|dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Conventional [[superconductivity]] is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.\n\n==Generalisation and technical usage==\nFor spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed \"hidden symmetry\", and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the [[Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson|Goldstone boson]].)\n\nWhen a theory is symmetric with respect to a [[symmetry group]], but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate ''which'' member is distinct, only that ''one is''. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.\n\nThe crucial concept in physics theories is the [[order parameter]]. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a [[vacuum expectation value|''vacuum'' expectation value]]) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the [[ordered phase]], and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a \"frame of reference\" to be measured against. In that case, the [[vacuum state]] does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized  '''Wigner mode''' in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) '''Nambu\u2013Goldstone mode'''. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless [[Goldstone boson]]s arise.\n\nThe symmetry group can be discrete, such as the [[space group]] of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a [[Lie group]]), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a [[vacuum state]] of the full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry.\n\n==Nobel Prize==\nOn October 7, 2008, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awarded the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. [[Yoichiro Nambu]], of the [[University of Chicago]], won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically [[chiral symmetry breaking]]. Physicists [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] and [[Toshihide Maskawa]], of [[Kyoto University]], shared the other half of the prize for discovering the origin of the [[Explicit symmetry breaking|explicit breaking]] of CP symmetry in the weak interactions.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Nobel Foundation|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2008|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/index.html|work=nobelprize.org|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}</ref> This origin is ultimately reliant on the Higgs mechanism, but, so far understood as a \"just so\" feature of Higgs couplings, not a spontaneously broken symmetry phenomenon.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[Autocatalytic reactions and order creation]]\n* [[Catastrophe theory]]\n* [[Chiral symmetry breaking]]\n* [[CP-violation]]\n* [[Fermi ball]]\n* [[Gauge gravitation theory]]\n* [[Goldstone boson]]\n* [[Grand unified theory]]\n* [[Higgs mechanism]]\n* [[Higgs boson]]\n* [[Higgs field (classical)]]\n* [[Irreversibility]]\n* [[Magnetic catalysis]] of chiral symmetry breaking\n* [[Mermin\u2013Wagner theorem]]\n* [[Norton's dome]]\n* [[Second-order phase transition]]\n* [[Spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]] in chemistry\n* [[Symmetry breaking]]\n* [[Tachyon condensation]]\n* [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n* {{note|note1}} Note that (as in fundamental Higgs driven spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking) the term \"symmetry breaking\" is a misnomer when applied to gauge symmetries.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* For a pedagogic introduction to electroweak symmetry breaking with step by step derivations, not found in texts, of many key relations, see http://www.quantumfieldtheory.info/Electroweak_Sym_breaking.pdf\n* [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/unify.html#c2 Spontaneous symmetry breaking]\n* [http://prl.aps.org/50years/milestones#1964 Physical Review Letters \u2013 50th Anniversary Milestone Papers]\n* [http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/32522 In CERN Courier, Steven Weinberg reflects on spontaneous symmetry breaking]\n* [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble_mechanism Englert\u2013Brout\u2013Higgs\u2013Guralnik\u2013Hagen\u2013Kibble Mechanism on Scholarpedia]\n* [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble_mechanism_%28history%29 History of Englert\u2013Brout\u2013Higgs\u2013Guralnik\u2013Hagen\u2013Kibble Mechanism on Scholarpedia]\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3466 The History of the Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble development of the Theory of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Gauge Particles]\n* [http://www.worldscinet.com/ijmpa/24/2414/S0217751X09045431.html International Journal of Modern Physics A: The History of the Guralnik, Hagen and Kibble development of the Theory of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Gauge Particles]\n* [http://www.datafilehost.com/download-7d512618.html Guralnik, G S; Hagen, C R and Kibble, T W B (1967).

In a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Joe relates the events leading to his death.\n\nSix months earlier, down-on-his-luck [[screenwriting|screenwriter]] Joe tries selling [[Paramount Pictures]] producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. [[Script coverage|Script reader]] Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from [[repossession]] men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman inside call to him, mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, the butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten [[silent film]] star Norma Desmond. Learning Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about [[Salome]]. She plans to play the role herself in a return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a [[script doctor]].\n\nMoved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns that the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who explains that Norma is emotionally fragile and has attempted [[suicide]]. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers that he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. Joe tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party he again meets Betty, whom he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma.\n\nNorma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole, but petulantly refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 [[Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A|Isotta Fraschini]]. The older studio employees recognize her and warmly greet her. DeMille receives her affectionately and treats her with great respect, tactfully evading her questions about her script. Meanwhile, Max learns that Cole merely wants to rent her unusual car for a film.\n\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights at Betty's Paramount office, collaborating on an original screenplay. His moonlighting is found out by Max, who reveals that he was a respected film director, discovered Norma as a teenage girl, made her a star and was her first husband. After she divorced him, he found life without her unbearable and abandoned his career to become her servant. Meanwhile, despite Betty's engagement to Artie, she and Joe fall in love. After Norma discovers a manuscript with Joe's and Betty's names on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, overhearing, invites Betty to come see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends he is satisfied being a [[gigolo]], but after she tearfully leaves he packs for a return to his old [[Ohio]] newspaper job. He bluntly informs Norma there will be no comeback, her fan mail comes from Max, and she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him to back it up. As Joe walks out of the house, Norma shoots him three times and he falls into the pool.\n\nThe flashback ends. The house is filled with police and reporters. Norma, having lost touch with reality, believes the [[newsreel]] cameras are there to film ''Salome''. Max and the police play along. Max sets up a scene for her and calls, \"Action!\" As the cameras roll, Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. She pauses and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, ending with, \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" as she makes a series of exaggerated swooping steps towards the camera, an equally exaggerated 'come-hither' expression upon her face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis\n* [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond\n* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Max von Mayerling\n* [[Nancy Olson]] as Betty Schaefer\n* [[Fred Clark]] as Sheldrake, film producer\n* [[Lloyd Gough]] as Morino, Joe's agent\n* [[Jack Webb]] as Artie Green\n* [[Franklyn Farnum]] as Undertaker\n* [[Larry J.

The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the [[star system (film)|star system]], luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.\n\nAs a young man living in [[Berlin]] in the 1920s, [[Billy Wilder]] was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \"the parade had passed them by\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.<ref name=\"perry\">Perry, p. ??</ref>\n\nThe character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existence of [[Mary Pickford]] and the mental disorders of [[Mae Murray]] and [[Clara Bow]].

In August 1948, [[D. M. Marshman Jr.]], formerly a writer for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film ''[[The Emperor Waltz]]'' (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from [[Paramount Pictures]] and avoid the restrictive [[censorship]] of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Breen Code]], they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis's \"I'm up that creek and I need a job,\" which became \"I'm over a barrel. I need a job.\" Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called ''A Can of Beans'' (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n<blockquote>The fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder's biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp's midnight funeral, at Joe's discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma's [[Mack Sennett]]-style \"entertainments\" for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma's \"waxworks\" card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma's has-been cronies.<ref>Kirgo (1979), p.276.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others.

Wilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting [[Mae West]] and [[Marlon Brando]] for the leads, but never contacted either with an offer. The filmakers approached [[Greta Garbo]], but she was not interested. Wilder contacted [[Pola Negri]] by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to [[Norma Shearer]], but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering [[Fred MacMurray]] to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited [[Mary Pickford]], but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing [[Montgomery Clift]] with her.<ref>Sikov, p. 286</ref>\n\nAccording to Wilder, he asked [[George Cukor]] for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most feted actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. At the peak of her career in 1925, she was said to have received 10,000 fan letters in a single week, and from 1920 until the early 1930s, she lived on Sunset Boulevard in an elaborate Italianate palace. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into [[talking pictures]]. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures, none of which were especially memorable. She accepted the end of her film career, and in the early 1930s moved to [[New York City]], where she worked in [[radio]]. In the mid-1940s, she worked in [[television]] and on the New York stage. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became  intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\nSwanson was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a [[screen test]], saying she had \"made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate,<ref name=\"swanson\">Swanson, pp.249-260</ref> and she signed a contract for $50,000.<ref>Sikov, p. 285</ref> In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There ''was'' a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"<ref name=\"aboutfilmnoir\">[http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue10/features/wilder/ Billy Wilder \u2013 \"About Film Noir].

An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to ''any'' woman.\"<ref>Sikov, p. 288</ref>  Clift himself was having an affair with a much older woman (the singer [[Libby Holman]]) which was suggested as his real reason for withdrawing from the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petersen|first1=Anne Helen|title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood: The Long Suicide of Montgomery Clift|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-montgomery-clift|accessdate=3 December 2016|work=Vanity Fair|date=23 September 2014|quote=He was also close with stage actress Libby Holman, 16 years his senior, who had become a notorious feature in the gossip columns following the suspicious death of her wealthy husband, rumors of lesbianism, and her general practice of dating younger men.

Following an appearance in ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'' (1940), he served in the military in [[World War II]], and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 was much less than had been offered to Clift.<ref>Sikov, pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nErich von Stroheim, a leading film director of the 1920s who had directed Swanson, was signed to play Max, Norma's faithful servant, protector, and former husband. For the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose [[Nancy Olson]], who had recently been considered for the role of [[Delilah]] in Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]].''<ref name=\"staggs\">Staggs (2002), p. ??</ref>\n\nDeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, and was filmed on the set of ''Samson and Delilah'' at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma \"young fella\" as he had called Swanson.\n\nNorma's friends who come to play bridge with her, described in the script as \"the waxworks\", were Swanson's contemporaries [[Buster Keaton]], [[Anna Q. Nilsson]], and [[H. B. Warner]], who like DeMille, played themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Cinematography and design===\n\nThe film's dark, shadowy [[black-and-white]], [[film noir]] cinematography was the work of [[John F. Seitz]]. Wilder had worked with him on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene. Wilder replied, \"you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.\" For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest \"mustiness,\" a trick he had also used for ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Christopher|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|date=2015|publisher=University of California Press|location=Oakland, California|isbn=9780520284357|pages=86\u2013114}}</ref>\n\nThe film had the option to be shot on colour, however it was shot on black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre. (The term ''noir'' is French for ''black''.)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terry|first1=Ryan|title=Why Sunset Boulevard Still Capture the \"Eyes of the World\" Today.|url=https://the-artifice.com/why-sunset-boulevard-still-captures-the-eyes-of-the-world-today/|website=The Artifice|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nFilm historian Tom Stempel writes, \"In both ''Double Indemnity'' and ''Sunset Boulevard'', Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond's mansion. Again with no seams showing.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n[[Edith Head]] designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the [[Christian Dior|Dior]] look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Truhler|first1=Kimberly|title=Cinema Style--Edith Head Gets Gloria Swanson Ready for her Close-Up in SUNSET BOULEVARD|url=http://www.glamamor.com/2014/09/SunsetBoulevard-GloriaSwanson-EdithHead.html|website=GlamAmor|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSwanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only \"a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.\"<ref name=\"swanson\" /> Head later described her assignment as \"the most challenging of my career,\" and explained her approach with the comment, \"Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.\" Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because \"she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" /> Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.\n\nThe overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer [[Hans Dreier]], whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. [[William Haines]], an interior designer and former actor, later refuted criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, \"[[Bebe Daniels]], [[Norma Shearer]], and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nThe bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept was actually owned by the dancer [[Gaby Deslys]], who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys's death. The bed appeared in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) starring [[Lon Chaney]].\n\nWilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe Gillis's apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often populated by struggling writers. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's back lot were filmed on the actual back lot, and the interior of [[Schwab's Drug Store]] was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at [[William O. Jenkins House|a house]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] built during the 1920s by the millionaire [[William O. Jenkins]]. Jenkins and his family lived in it for just one year, then left it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname, the \"Phantom House\".<ref>'Wilshire Phantom House Soon to be Only Memory\", ''Los Angeles Times'', February 24, 1957</ref> By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of [[J. Paul Getty|J.&nbsp;Paul Getty]]. The house was later featured in [[Nicholas Ray]]'s ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to allow construction of an office building .<ref>[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html Sunset Boulevard film locations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806060957/http://movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html# |date=2013-08-06 }}, The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The top houses from the movies|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9239346/The-top-houses-from-the-movies.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDuring filming, considerable publicity was given to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor [[Wally Westmore]] to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n==Score==\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (film score)}}\n\nThe musical score was the final element added to ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sikov|first1=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|date=2017|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1496812650|page=300}}</ref> The film was scored by [[Franz Waxman]]. His theme for Norma Desmond was based on [[tango music]], inspired by her having danced the tango with [[Rudolph Valentino]]. This style was contrasted with Joe Gillis's [[bebop]] theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for [[compact disc]] by the [[Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Joel McNeely]] and released in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=15251 |title=Soundtrack details: Sunset Blvd |publisher=SoundtrackCollector |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Original release and responses==\n\n===Previews and revision===\nWilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in [[Evanston, Illinois]], in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a [[morgue]], with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], and a third in [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening,<ref>Staggs (2002), pp. 151-152</ref> using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.<ref name=\"AFIdetail\">Production dates per the online [http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=26513 AFI Catalog of Feature Films detailed listing]</ref>\n\nIn Hollywood, Paramount arranged a private screening for the various studio heads and specially invited guests. After viewing the film, [[Barbara Stanwyck]] knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson's skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for [[Mary Pickford]], only to be told, \"She can't show herself, Gloria. She's too overcome. We all are.\" [[Louis B. Mayer]] berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!\" Upon hearing of Mayer's slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder's family perished.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sikov|first=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|year=1999|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=0-7868-8503-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B.

Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or [[Bette Davis]] for ''All About Eve'' and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer [[Judy Holliday]] for ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]''<ref name=\"swanson\" />''.'' Bette Davis believed that her and Swanson's comparable characters effectively \"cancelled each other out\", allowing Holliday to win.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/playboyinterview00play|title=The Playboy interviews : larger than life|date=2006|publisher=M Press|others=Randall, Stephen.|isbn=1595820469|edition=1st M Press|location=Milwaukie, OR|oclc=71350355}}</ref> Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: \"It slowly dawned on me that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond.\"<ref name=\"wileybona\" />\n\n''Sunset Boulevard'' also received [[Golden Globe]] awards for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama|Best Motion Picture Actress]] (Swanson), [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director - Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture Director]] and [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Original Score|Best Motion Picture Score]]. Wilder and Brackett won a [[Writers Guild of America, East]] Award for Best Written American Drama, while the [[Directors Guild of America]] nominated Wilder for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures. The [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review]] voted it [[National Board of Review Award for Best Film|Best Picture]], and Swanson received Best Actress.\n\nIt was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on the September 17, 1951 broadcast of ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' with Gloria Swanson and William Holden in their original film roles.<ref>Staggs (2002), p. 297</ref>\n\n===Recognition since 1989===\n[[File:Sunset Boulevard Ready For My Close-up.png|thumb|300px|The famous \"I'm ready for my close-up\" final scene from ''Sunset Boulevard'']]\nIn 1989, the film was among the first group of 25 deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"nfrlist\">[https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html List of selected films 1989\u20132004.

They parted amicably and respected their long-term partnership by not airing any grievance publicly. Their mutual respect and courteous integrity remained in force throughout the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter/director [[Garson Kanin]] that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as \"an unexpected blow\" from which he never recovered fully. When asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.<ref>Sikov, pp. 305\u2013306</ref>\n\nThe two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] ''Sunset Boulevard.'' Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, ''Past Performance'', served as the basis for the ''Sunset'' script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in [[damages|general damages]], $250,000 in [[punitive damages]], $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.<ref>Sikov, pp. 310\u2013311</ref>\n\nBrackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), and wrote ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'' (1953), the breakthrough film for [[Marilyn Monroe]] as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' and ''[[Some Like It Hot]].'' Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\nWilliam Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States.\n\nNancy Olson's pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success. She went on to star in ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961) and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (1963), in which she was paired with [[Fred MacMurray]], but despite the films' popularity with movie-goers, her career stalled. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces for ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.\n\nSimilarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in ''Sunset Boulevard''. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing \"a parody of a parody,\" she virtually retired from films.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\n''Sunset Boulevard'' was shown again in [[New York City]] in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.\n\nFilms that discuss ''Sunset Boulevard'' in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include ''[[Soapdish]]'' (1991), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001),<ref name=\"staggs\" /> ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006) and ''[[Be Cool]]'' (2005). The ending of ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) is a parody of ''Sunset Boulevard's'' final scene.\n\n==Restoration and home media==\nBy the late 1990s, most ''Sunset Boulevard'' prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using [[nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[filmstock]], much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it [[digital video|digitally]] restored. This restored version was released on [[DVD]] in 2002.<ref name=\"restoration\">Robert A.

(at first ''Starring Norma Desmond''). Stapley and Hughes first approached Swanson about appearing in a musical revue they had written, ''About Time'' (based on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''). Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film. Within a week, Stapley and Dickson had written three songs which Swanson approved.<ref name=StapleyHughes>Based on liner notes to ''Boulevard!'' demo recording CD release, by Richard Stapley, Tim J Hutton and Steven M Warner</ref>\n\nIn this version, the romance between Gillis and Schaefer was allowed to blossom, and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live \"happily ever after.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount gave verbal permission to proceed with the musical, there was no formal legal option. In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.\n\nIn 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from ''Boulevard!'' into a musical ''Swanson on Sunset'', based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing ''Boulevard!''.\n\n===Other failed attempts===\n[[Stephen Sondheim]] briefly considered turning ''Sunset Boulevard'' into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Look, I made a hat : collected lyrics (1981-2011) with attendant comments, amplifications, dogmas, harangues, wafflings, anecdotes and miscellany|last=Stephen.|first=Sondheim|date=2011|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-0753522608|location=London|oclc=751797401}}</ref> [[Hal Prince]] later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with [[Angela Lansbury]] playing Norma Desmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sondheim.com/features/stephen_sondheim.html|title=Side by Side With Stephen Sondheim|website=sondheim.com|access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard : Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the dark Hollywood dream|last=Staggs|first=Sam|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|date=February 2003|isbn=0312302541|edition= 1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York|page=320|oclc=51815402}}</ref>\n\n===Lloyd Webber and Black & Hampton===\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (musical)}}\nA musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and [[Christopher Hampton]], and music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] was staged in 1993 in London, with [[Patti LuPone]] playing Norma Desmond.

[[Script coverage|Script reader]] Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from [[repossession]] men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman inside call to him, mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, the butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten [[silent film]] star Norma Desmond. Learning Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about [[Salome]]. She plans to play the role herself in a return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a [[script doctor]].\n\nMoved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns that the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who explains that Norma is emotionally fragile and has attempted [[suicide]]. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers that he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. Joe tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party he again meets Betty, whom he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma.\n\nNorma has Max deliver the edited Salome script to her former director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole, but petulantly refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 [[Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A|Isotta Fraschini]]. The older studio employees recognize her and warmly greet her. DeMille receives her affectionately and treats her with great respect, tactfully evading her questions about her script. Meanwhile, Max learns that Cole merely wants to rent her unusual car for a film.\n\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights at Betty's Paramount office, collaborating on an original screenplay. His moonlighting is found out by Max, who reveals that he was a respected film director, discovered Norma as a teenage girl, made her a star and was her first husband. After she divorced him, he found life without her unbearable and abandoned his career to become her servant. Meanwhile, despite Betty's engagement to Artie, she and Joe fall in love. After Norma discovers a manuscript with Joe's and Betty's names on it, she phones Betty and insinuates what sort of man Joe really is. Joe, overhearing, invites Betty to come see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends he is satisfied being a [[gigolo]], but after she tearfully leaves he packs for a return to his old [[Ohio]] newspaper job. He bluntly informs Norma there will be no comeback, her fan mail comes from Max, and she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him to back it up. As Joe walks out of the house, Norma shoots him three times and he falls into the pool.\n\nThe flashback ends. The house is filled with police and reporters. Norma, having lost touch with reality, believes the [[newsreel]] cameras are there to film ''Salome''. Max and the police play along. Max sets up a scene for her and calls, \"Action!\" As the cameras roll, Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. She pauses and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, ending with, \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" as she makes a series of exaggerated swooping steps towards the camera, an equally exaggerated 'come-hither' expression upon her face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis\n* [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond\n* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Max von Mayerling\n* [[Nancy Olson]] as Betty Schaefer\n* [[Fred Clark]] as Sheldrake, film producer\n* [[Lloyd Gough]] as Morino, Joe's agent\n* [[Jack Webb]] as Artie Green\n* [[Franklyn Farnum]] as Undertaker\n* [[Larry J.

The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the [[star system (film)|star system]], luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.\n\nAs a young man living in [[Berlin]] in the 1920s, [[Billy Wilder]] was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \"the parade had passed them by\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.<ref name=\"perry\">Perry, p. ??</ref>\n\nThe character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existence of [[Mary Pickford]] and the mental disorders of [[Mae Murray]] and [[Clara Bow]]. It is usually regarded as a fictional composite inspired by several different people, not just a thinly disguised portrait of one in particular. Nevertheless, some{{who|date=March 2020}} commentators have tried to identify specific models. One{{who|date=March 2020}} asserts that [[Norma Talmadge]] is \"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\" of the film.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Kehr | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/movies/homevideo/14kehr.html | title=An Independent Woman, Nobly Suffering in Silents | work=[[The New York Times]]| date= March 11, 2010 | accessdate= November 19, 2011}}</ref> The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress [[Mabel Normand]] and director [[William Desmond Taylor]], a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Gloria Swanson & Billy Wilder - ca. 1950.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Billy Wilder]] ]]\nWilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948, but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948, [[D. M. Marshman Jr.]], formerly a writer for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film ''[[The Emperor Waltz]]'' (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from [[Paramount Pictures]] and avoid the restrictive [[censorship]] of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Breen Code]], they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis's \"I'm up that creek and I need a job,\" which became \"I'm over a barrel. I need a job.\" Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called ''A Can of Beans'' (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n<blockquote>The fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder's biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp's midnight funeral, at Joe's discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma's [[Mack Sennett]]-style \"entertainments\" for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma's \"waxworks\" card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma's has-been cronies.<ref>Kirgo (1979), p.276.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others. When asked if ''Sunset Boulevard'' was a [[black comedy]], he replied: \"No, just a picture\".<ref name=\"londonreviewofbooks\">Wood, Michael (March 2, 2000).

Wilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting [[Mae West]] and [[Marlon Brando]] for the leads, but never contacted either with an offer. The filmakers approached [[Greta Garbo]], but she was not interested. Wilder contacted [[Pola Negri]] by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to [[Norma Shearer]], but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering [[Fred MacMurray]] to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited [[Mary Pickford]], but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing [[Montgomery Clift]] with her.<ref>Sikov, p. 286</ref>\n\nAccording to Wilder, he asked [[George Cukor]] for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most feted actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. At the peak of her career in 1925, she was said to have received 10,000 fan letters in a single week, and from 1920 until the early 1930s, she lived on Sunset Boulevard in an elaborate Italianate palace. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into [[talking pictures]]. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures, none of which were especially memorable. She accepted the end of her film career, and in the early 1930s moved to [[New York City]], where she worked in [[radio]]. In the mid-1940s, she worked in [[television]] and on the New York stage. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became  intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\nSwanson was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a [[screen test]], saying she had \"made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate,<ref name=\"swanson\">Swanson, pp.249-260</ref> and she signed a contract for $50,000.<ref>Sikov, p. 285</ref> In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There ''was'' a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"<ref name=\"aboutfilmnoir\">[http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue10/features/wilder/ Billy Wilder \u2013 \"About Film Noir].

An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to ''any'' woman.\"<ref>Sikov, p. 288</ref>  Clift himself was having an affair with a much older woman (the singer [[Libby Holman]]) which was suggested as his real reason for withdrawing from the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Petersen|first1=Anne Helen|title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood: The Long Suicide of Montgomery Clift|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-montgomery-clift|accessdate=3 December 2016|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast|date=23 September 2014|quote=He was also close with stage actress Libby Holman, 16 years his senior, who had become a notorious feature in the gossip columns following the suspicious death of her wealthy husband, rumors of lesbianism, and her general practice of dating younger men.

Following an appearance in ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'' (1940), he served in the military in [[World War II]], and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 was much less than had been offered to Clift.<ref>Sikov, pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nErich von Stroheim, a leading film director of the 1920s who had directed Swanson, was signed to play Max, Norma's faithful servant, protector, and former husband. For the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose [[Nancy Olson]], who had recently been considered for the role of [[Delilah]] in Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]].''<ref name=\"staggs\">Staggs (2002), p. ??</ref>\n\nDeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, and was filmed on the set of ''Samson and Delilah'' at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma \"young fella\" as he had called Swanson.\n\nNorma's friends who come to play bridge with her, described in the script as \"the waxworks\", were Swanson's contemporaries [[Buster Keaton]], [[Anna Q. Nilsson]], and [[H. B. Warner]], who like DeMille, played themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Cinematography and design===\n\nThe film's dark, shadowy [[black-and-white]], [[film noir]] cinematography was the work of [[John F. Seitz]]. Wilder had worked with him on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene. Wilder replied, \"you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.\" For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest \"mustiness,\" a trick he had also used for ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Christopher|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|date=2015|publisher=University of California Press|location=Oakland, California|isbn=9780520284357|pages=86\u2013114}}</ref>\n\nThe film had the option to be shot on colour, however it was shot on black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre. (The term ''noir'' is French for ''black''.)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terry|first1=Ryan|title=Why Sunset Boulevard Still Capture the \"Eyes of the World\" Today.|url=https://the-artifice.com/why-sunset-boulevard-still-captures-the-eyes-of-the-world-today/|website=The Artifice|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nFilm historian Tom Stempel writes, \"In both ''Double Indemnity'' and ''Sunset Boulevard'', Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond's mansion. Again with no seams showing.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n[[Edith Head]] designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the [[Christian Dior|Dior]] look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Truhler|first1=Kimberly|title=Cinema Style--Edith Head Gets Gloria Swanson Ready for her Close-Up in SUNSET BOULEVARD|url=http://www.glamamor.com/2014/09/SunsetBoulevard-GloriaSwanson-EdithHead.html|website=GlamAmor|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSwanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only \"a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.\"<ref name=\"swanson\" /> Head later described her assignment as \"the most challenging of my career,\" and explained her approach with the comment, \"Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.\" Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because \"she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" /> Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.\n\nThe overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer [[Hans Dreier]], whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. [[William Haines]], an interior designer and former actor, later refuted criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, \"[[Bebe Daniels]], [[Norma Shearer]], and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nThe bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept was actually owned by the dancer [[Gaby Deslys]], who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys's death. The bed appeared in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) starring [[Lon Chaney]].\n\nWilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe Gillis's apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often populated by struggling writers. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's back lot were filmed on the actual back lot, and the interior of [[Schwab's Drug Store]] was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at [[William O. Jenkins House|a house]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] built during the 1920s by the millionaire [[William O. Jenkins]]. Jenkins and his family lived in it for just one year, then left it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname, the \"Phantom House\".<ref>'Wilshire Phantom House Soon to be Only Memory\", ''Los Angeles Times'', February 24, 1957</ref> By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of [[J. Paul Getty|J.&nbsp;Paul Getty]]. The house was later featured in [[Nicholas Ray]]'s ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to allow construction of an office building .<ref>[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html Sunset Boulevard film locations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806060957/http://movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html# |date=2013-08-06 }}, The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The top houses from the movies|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9239346/The-top-houses-from-the-movies.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDuring filming, considerable publicity was given to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor [[Wally Westmore]] to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n==Score==\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (film score)}}\n\nThe musical score was the final element added to ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sikov|first1=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|date=2017|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1496812650|page=300}}</ref> The film was scored by [[Franz Waxman]]. His theme for Norma Desmond was based on [[tango music]], inspired by her having danced the tango with [[Rudolph Valentino]]. This style was contrasted with Joe Gillis's [[bebop]] theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for [[compact disc]] by the [[Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Joel McNeely]] and released in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=15251 |title=Soundtrack details: Sunset Blvd |publisher=SoundtrackCollector |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Original release and responses==\n\n===Previews and revision===\nWilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in [[Evanston, Illinois]], in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a [[morgue]], with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], and a third in [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening,<ref>Staggs (2002), pp. 151-152</ref> using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.<ref name=\"AFIdetail\">Production dates per the online [http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=26513 AFI Catalog of Feature Films detailed listing]</ref>\n\nIn Hollywood, Paramount arranged a private screening for the various studio heads and specially invited guests. After viewing the film, [[Barbara Stanwyck]] knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson's skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for [[Mary Pickford]], only to be told, \"She can't show herself, Gloria. She's too overcome. We all are.\" [[Louis B. Mayer]] berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!\" Upon hearing of Mayer's slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder's family perished.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sikov|first=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|year=1999|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=0-7868-8503-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B.

They parted amicably and respected their long-term partnership by not airing any grievance publicly. Their mutual respect and courteous integrity remained in force throughout the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter/director [[Garson Kanin]] that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as \"an unexpected blow\" from which he never recovered fully. When asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.<ref>Sikov, pp. 305\u2013306</ref>\n\nThe two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] ''Sunset Boulevard.'' Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, ''Past Performance'', served as the basis for the ''Sunset'' script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in [[damages|general damages]], $250,000 in [[punitive damages]], $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.<ref>Sikov, pp. 310\u2013311</ref>\n\nBrackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), and wrote ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'' (1953), the breakthrough film for [[Marilyn Monroe]] as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' and ''[[Some Like It Hot]].'' Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\nWilliam Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States.\n\nNancy Olson's pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success. She went on to star in ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961) and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (1963), in which she was paired with [[Fred MacMurray]], but despite the films' popularity with movie-goers, her career stalled. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces for ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.\n\nSimilarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in ''Sunset Boulevard''. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing \"a parody of a parody,\" she virtually retired from films.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\n''Sunset Boulevard'' was shown again in [[New York City]] in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.\n\nFilms that discuss ''Sunset Boulevard'' in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include ''[[Soapdish]]'' (1991), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001),<ref name=\"staggs\" /> ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006) and ''[[Be Cool]]'' (2005). The ending of ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) is a parody of ''Sunset Boulevard's'' final scene.\n\n==Restoration and home media==\nBy the late 1990s, most ''Sunset Boulevard'' prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using [[nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[filmstock]], much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it [[digital video|digitally]] restored.

(at first ''Starring Norma Desmond''). Stapley and Hughes first approached Swanson about appearing in a musical revue they had written, ''About Time'' (based on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''). Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film. Within a week, Stapley and Dickson had written three songs which Swanson approved.<ref name=StapleyHughes>Based on liner notes to ''Boulevard!'' demo recording CD release, by Richard Stapley, Tim J Hutton and Steven M Warner</ref>\n\nIn this version, the romance between Gillis and Schaefer was allowed to blossom, and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live \"happily ever after.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount gave verbal permission to proceed with the musical, there was no formal legal option. In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.\n\nIn 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from ''Boulevard!'' into a musical ''Swanson on Sunset'', based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing ''Boulevard!''.\n\n===Other failed attempts===\n[[Stephen Sondheim]] briefly considered turning ''Sunset Boulevard'' into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Look, I made a hat : collected lyrics (1981-2011) with attendant comments, amplifications, dogmas, harangues, wafflings, anecdotes and miscellany|last=Stephen.|first=Sondheim|date=2011|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-0753522608|location=London|oclc=751797401}}</ref> [[Hal Prince]] later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with [[Angela Lansbury]] playing Norma Desmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sondheim.com/features/stephen_sondheim.html|title=Side by Side With Stephen Sondheim|website=sondheim.com|access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard : Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the dark Hollywood dream|last=Staggs|first=Sam|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|date=February 2003|isbn=0312302541|edition= 1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York|page=320|oclc=51815402}}</ref>\n\n===Lloyd Webber and Black & Hampton===\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (musical)}}\nA musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and [[Christopher Hampton]], and music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] was staged in 1993 in London, with [[Patti LuPone]] playing Norma Desmond.

It is named after Japanese astrophysicist [[Chushiro Hayashi]]. On the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]], which plots luminosity against temperature, the track is a nearly vertical curve. After a [[protostar]] ends its phase of rapid contraction and becomes a [[T Tauri star]], it is extremely luminous. The star continues to contract, but much more slowly.  While slowly contracting, the star follows the Hayashi track downwards, becoming several times less luminous but staying at roughly the same surface temperature, until either a [[radiative zone]] develops, at which point the star starts following the [[Henyey track]], or nuclear fusion begins, marking its entry onto the [[main sequence]].\n\nThe shape and position of the Hayashi track on the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram depends on the star's mass and chemical composition. For solar-mass stars, the track lies at a temperature of roughly 4000 K. Stars on the track are nearly fully convective and have their [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] dominated by hydrogen ions. Stars less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} are fully convective even on the main sequence, but their opacity begins to be dominated by [[Kramers' opacity law]] after nuclear fusion begins, thus moving them off the Hayashi track. Stars between 0.5 and {{Solar mass|3}} develop a radiative\nzone prior to reaching the main sequence. Stars between 3 and {{Solar mass|10}} are fully radiative at the beginning of the pre-main-sequence. Even heavier stars are born onto the main sequence, with no PMS evolution.<ref name=Palla2012/>\n\nAt an end of a low- or intermediate-mass star's life, the star follows an analogue of the Hayashi track, but in reverse\u2014it increases in luminosity, expands, and stays at roughly the same temperature, eventually becoming a [[red giant]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1961, Professor [[Chushiro Hayashi]] published two papers<ref name=hayashi1/><ref name=hayashi2/> that led to the concept of the [[pre-main-sequence]] and form the basis of the modern understanding of early stellar evolution. Hayashi realized that the existing model, in which stars are assumed to be in [[radiative equilibrium]] with no substantial convection zone, cannot explain the shape of the [[red giant branch]].<ref name=Stahler1988/>  He therefore replaced the model by including the effects of thick [[convection zone]]s on a star's interior.\n\nA few years prior, [[Donald Edward Osterbrock|Osterbrock]] proposed deep convection zones with efficient convection, analyzing them using the opacity of H- ions (the dominant opacity source in cool atmospheres) in temperatures below 5000K.  However, the earliest numerical models of Sun-like stars did not follow up on this work and continued to assume radiative equilibrium.<ref name=Palla2012/>\n\nIn his 1961 papers, Hayashi showed that the convective envelope of a star is determined by:\n\n<math>E = 4\\pi G^{3/2}(\\mu H/k)^{5/2}M^{1/2}R^{3/2}P/T^{5/2}</math>\n\nwhere E is unitless, and not the [[energy]].  Modelling stars as [[polytrope]]s with index 3/2\u2014in other words, assuming they follow a pressure-density relationship of <math>P=K\\rho^{5/3}</math>\u2014he found that E=45 is the maximum for a [[quasistatic process|quasistatic]] star.  If a star is not contracting rapidly, E=45 defines a curve on the HR diagram, to the right of which the star cannot exist.  He then computed the evolutionary tracks and [[Stellar isochrone|isochrones]] (luminosity-temperature distributions of stars at a given age) for a variety of stellar masses and noted that [[NGC2264]], a very young star cluster, fits the isochrones well.  In particular, he calculated much lower ages for solar-type stars in NGC2264 and predicted that these stars were rapidly contracting [[T Tauri stars]].\n\nIn 1962, Hayashi published a 183-page review of stellar evolution.  Here, he discussed the evolution of stars born in the forbidden region.  These stars rapidly contract due to gravity before settling to a quasistatic, fully convective state on the Hayashi tracks.\n\nIn 1965, numerical models by Iben and Ezer & Cameron realistically simulated pre-main-sequence evolution, including the [[Henyey track]] that stars follow after leaving the Hayashi track.  These standard PMS tracks can still be found in textbooks on stellar evolution.\n\n==Forbidden zone==\n{{See also|Hayashi limit}}\nThe '''forbidden zone''' is the region on the HR diagram to the right of the Hayashi track where no star can be in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], even those that are partially or fully radiative.  Newborn [[protostar]]s start out in this zone, but are not in hydrostatic equilibrium and will rapidly move towards the Hayashi track.\n\nBecause stars emit light via [[blackbody radiation]], the power per unit surface area they emit is given by the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]:\n\n:<math>j^{\\star} = \\sigma T^4</math>\nThe star's luminosity is therefore given by:\n:<math>L = 4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4</math>\n\nFor a given L, a lower temperature implies a larger radius, and vice versa. Thus, the Hayashi track separates the HR diagram into two regions: the allowed region to the left, with high temperatures and smaller radii for each luminosity, and the forbidden region to the right, with lower temperatures and correspondingly higher radii.  The [[Hayashi limit]] can refer to either the lower bound in temperature or the upper bound on radius defined by the Hayashi track.\n\nThe region to the right is forbidden because it can be shown that a star in the region must have a temperature gradient of:\n:<math>\\frac{d \\ln T}{d \\ln P} > 0.4</math>\nwhere <math>\\frac{d \\ln T}{d \\ln P} = 0.4</math> for a monatomic ideal gas undergoing [[adiabatic]] expansion or contraction.  A temperature gradient greater than 0.4 is therefore called superadiabatic.\n\nConsider a star with a superadiabatic gradient.  Imagine a parcel of gas that starts at radial position r, but moves upwards to r+dr in a sufficiently short time that it exchanges negligible heat with its surroundings\u2014in other words, the process is adiabatic.  The pressure of the surroundings, as well as that of the parcel, decreases by some amount dP.  The parcel's temperature changes by <math>dT = 0.4\\frac{T}{P}dP</math>.  The temperature of the surroundings also decreases, but by some amount dT' that is greater than dT.  The parcel therefore ends up being hotter than its surroundings.  Since the [[ideal gas law]] can be written <math>P = \\frac{\\rho RT}{\\mu}</math>, a higher temperature implies a lower density at the same pressure.  The parcel is therefore also less dense than its surroundings.  This will cause it to rise even more, and the parcel will become even less dense than its new surroundings.\n\nClearly, this situation is not stable.  In fact, a superadiabatic gradient causes [[convection]].  Convection tends to lower the temperature gradient because the rising parcel of gas will eventually be dispersed, dumping its excess thermal and kinetic energy into its surroundings and heating up said surroundings.  In stars, the convection process is known to be highly efficient, with a typical <math>\\frac{d \\ln T}{d \\ln P}</math> that only exceeds the adiabatic gradient by 1 part in 10 million.<ref name=struct_evol/>\n\nIf a star is placed in the forbidden zone, with a temperature gradient much greater than 0.4, it will experience rapid convection that brings the gradient down.  Since this convection will drastically change the star's pressure and temperature distribution, the star is not in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and will contract until it is.\n\nA star far to the left of the Hayashi track has a temperature gradient smaller than adiabatic. This means that if a parcel of gas rises a tiny bit, it will be more dense than its surroundings and sink back to where it came from. Convection therefore does not occur, and almost all energy output is carried radiatively.\n\n==Star formation==\nStars form when small regions of a [[giant molecular cloud]] collapse under their own gravity, becoming [[protostar]]s. The collapse releases gravitational energy, which heats up the protostar.  This process occurs on the [[Free fall|free-fall timescale]], which is roughly 100,000 years for solar-mass protostars, and ends when the protostar reaches approximately 4000 K.  This is known as the Hayashi boundary, and at this point, the protostar is on the Hayashi track.  At this point, they are known as [[T Tauri stars]] and continue to contract, but much more slowly.  As they contract, they decrease in luminosity because less surface area becomes available for emitting light. The Hayashi track gives the resulting change in temperature, which will be minimal compared to the change in luminosity because the Hayashi track is nearly vertical.  In other words, on the HR diagram, a T Tauri star starts out on the Hayashi track with a high luminosity and moves downward along the track as time passes.\n\nThe Hayashi track describes a fully [[convective]] star.  This is a good approximation for very young pre-main-sequence stars they are still cool and highly [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], so that [[radiative transport]] is insufficient to carry away the generated energy and convection must occur.  Stars less massive than {{Solar mass|0.5}} remain fully convective, and therefore remain on the Hayashi track, throughout their pre-main-sequence stage, joining the main sequence at the bottom of the Hayashi track. Stars heavier than {{Solar mass|0.5}} have higher interior temperatures, which decreases their central opacity and allows radiation to carry away large amounts of energy.  This allows a [[radiative zone]] to develop around the star's core. The star is then no longer on the Hayashi track, and experiences a period of rapidly increasing temperature at nearly constant luminosity.  This is called the [[Henyey track]], and ends when temperatures are high enough to ignite hydrogen fusion in the core.  The star is then on the [[main sequence]].\n\nLower-mass stars follow the Hayashi track until the track intersects with the main sequence, at which point hydrogen fusion begins and the star follows the main sequence.  Even lower-mass 'stars' never achieve the conditions necessary to fuse hydrogen and become [[brown dwarfs]].\n\n==Derivation==\nThe exact shape and position of the Hayashi track can only be computed\nnumerically using computer models.  Nevertheless, we can make an extremely\ncrude analytical argument that captures most of the track's properties.  The\nfollowing derivation loosely follows that of Kippenhahn, Weigert, and Weiss in\n''Stellar Structure and Evolution''.<ref name=struct_evol/>\n\nIn our\nsimple model, a star is assumed to consist of a fully convective interior\ninside of a fully radiative atmosphere.\n\nThe convective interior is assumed to be an ideal monatomic gas with a perfectly adiabatic temperature gradient:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\ln{T}}{d\\ln{P}} = 0.4</math>\n\nThis quantity is sometimes labelled <math>\\nabla</math>.  The following\nadiabatic equation therefore holds true for the entire interior:\n\n:<math>P^{1-\\gamma}T^{\\gamma} = C</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[adiabatic gamma]], which is 5/3 for an ideal\nmonatomic gas.  The ideal gas law says:\n\n:<math>P = NkT/V</math>\n:<math>= \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu H}</math>\n:<math>= (\\frac{k\\rho C}{\\mu H})^\\gamma</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the molecular weight per particle and H is (to a very good\napproximation) the mass of a hydrogen atom.  This equation represents a\n[[polytrope]] of index 1.5, since a polytrope is defined by \n<math>P = K\\rho^{1 + 1/n}</math>, where n=1.5 is the polytropic index.  Applying \nthe equation to the center of the star gives:\n<math>P_c = (\\frac{k\\rho_c C}{\\mu H})^\\gamma</math>\nWe can solve for C:\n:<math>C = \\frac{\\mu HP_c^{1/\\gamma}}{\\rho_c k}</math>\n\nBut for any polytrope, <math>P_c = W_n\\frac{GM^2}{R^4}</math>,\n<math>\\rho_c = K_n\\rho_{avg}</math>, and \n<math>R^{\\frac{3-n}{n}} M^{\\frac{n-1}{n}} = \\frac{K}{GN_n}</math>.  <math>W_n, K_n,\nN_n,</math> and K are all constants independent of pressure and density,\nand the average density is defined as \n<math>\\rho_{avg} \\equiv \\frac{M}{4/3 \\pi R^3}</math>.  Plugging all 3 equations\ninto the equation for C, we have:\n\n:<math> C \\sim M^{2-\\gamma} R^{3\\gamma - 4}</math>\n\nwhere all multiplicative constants have been ignored.  Recall that our original\ndefinition of C was:\n\n:<math>P^{1-\\gamma}T^\\gamma = C</math>\n\nWe therefore have, for any star of mass M and radius R:\n\n:<math>P^{1-\\gamma}T^\\gamma \\sim M^{2 - \\gamma} R^{3\\gamma - 4}</math>\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\ln P = \\frac{2-\\gamma}{1-\\gamma}\\ln M + \\frac{3\\gamma - 4}\n{1 - \\gamma}\\ln R - \\gamma \\ln T</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nWe need another relationship between P, T, M, and R, in order to eliminate P.\nThis relationship will come from the atmosphere model.\n\nThe atmosphere is assumed to be thin, with average [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] k.  Opacity is\ndefined to be optical depth divided by density. Thus, by definition, the\noptical depth of the stellar surface, also called the [[photosphere]], is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\tau}{dr} = k\\rho</math>\n:<math>\\tau = \\int_R^\\infty k\\rho dr</math>\n:<math> = k\\int_R^\\infty \\rho dr</math>\n\nwhere R is the stellar radius, also known as the position of the photosphere.\nThe pressure at the surface is:\n\n:<math>P_0 = \\int_R^\\infty g\\rho dr</math>\n:<math>= \\frac{GM}{R^2}\\int_R^\\infty \\rho dr</math>\n:<math> = \\frac{GM\\tau}{kR^2}</math>\n\nThe optical depth at the photosphere turns out to be <math>\\tau = 2/3</math>. By\ndefinition, the temperature of the photosphere is <math>T = T_{eff}</math> where effective\ntemperature is given by <math>L = 4\\pi R^2T_{eff}^4</math>.  Therefore,\nthe pressure is:\n\n:<math>P_0 = \\frac{GM}{R^2}\\frac{2}{3k}</math>\n\nWe can approximate the opacity to be:\n\n:<math>k = k_0P^aT^b</math>\n\nwhere a=1, b=3.  Plugging this into the pressure equation, we get:\n\n:<math>P_0 = const(\\frac{M}{R^2T_{eff}^b})^{\\frac{1}{a+1}}</math>\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\\ln P_0 = \\ln{const} + \\frac{1}{a+1}(\\ln{M} - 2\\ln{R} - \nb\\ln{T_{eff}}) </math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nFinally, we need to eliminate R and introduce L, the luminosity.  This can be\ndone with the equation:\n\n:<math>L = 4\\pi R^2\\sigma T_{eff}^4</math>\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\\ln{R} = 0.5\\ln{L} - 2\\ln{T_{eff}} + const\n</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nEquation {{EquationNote|1}} and {{EquationNote|2}} can now be combined by\nsetting <math>T=T_{eff}</math> and <math>P=P_0</math> in Equation 1, then eliminating <math>P_0</math>.\nR can be eliminated using Equation {{EquationNote|3}}.  After some algebra,\nand after setting <math>\\gamma = 5/3</math>, we get:\n\n:<math>\\ln{T_{eff}} = A\\ln{L} + B\\ln{M} + const</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>A = \\frac{0.75a-0.25}{5.5a+b+1.5}</math>\n:<math>B = \\frac{0.5a + 1.5}{5.5a+b+1.5}</math>\n\nIn cool stellar atmospheres (T < 5000 K) like those of newborn stars, \nthe dominant source of opacity is the H- ion, for which \n<math>a \\approx 1</math> and <math>b \\approx 3</math>, we get \n<math>A = 0.05</math> and <math>B = 0.2</math>.\n\nSince A is much smaller than\n1, the Hayashi track is extremely steep: if the luminosity changes by a factor\nof 2, the temperature only changes by 4 percent.  The fact that B is positive\nindicates that the Hayashi track shifts left on the HR diagram, towards higher\ntemperatures, as mass increases.  Although this model is extremely crude, these\nqualitative observations are fully supported by numerical simulations.\n\nAt high temperatures, the atmosphere's opacity begins to be dominated by\n[[Kramers' opacity law]] instead of the H- ion, with a=1 and b=-4.5  In that\ncase, A=0.2 in our crude model, far higher than 0.05, and the star is no longer\non the Hayashi track.\n\nIn ''Stellar Interiors'', Hansen, Kawaler, and Trimble go through a similar\nderivation without neglecting multiplicative constants,<ref name=interiors/> \nand arrived at:\n\n:<math>T_{eff} = (2600 K)\\mu^{13/51}(\\frac{M}{M_{\\odot}})^{7/51}(\\frac{L}{L_{\\odot}})^{1/102}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the molecular weight per particle.  The authors note that the coefficient of 2600K is too\nlow\u2014it should be around 4000K\u2014but this equation nevertheless shows that\ntemperature is nearly independent of luminosity.\n\n==Numerical results==\n[[File:Hayashi composition.png|thumb|Hayashi tracks of a {{Solar mass|0.8}} star with helium mass fraction 0.245, for 3 different metallicities]]\n\nThe diagram at the top of this article shows numerically computed stellar \nevolution\ntracks for various masses.  The vertical portions of each track is the Hayashi\ntrack.  The endpoints of each track lie on the main sequence.\nThe horizontal segments for higher-mass stars show the [[Henyey track]].\n\nIt is approximately true that: \n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\ln{T_{eff}}}{\\partial \\ln{M}} \\approx 0.1</math>.\n\nThe diagram to the right shows how Hayashi tracks change with changes in\nchemical composition.  Z is the star's [[metallicity]], the mass fraction not\naccounted for by hydrogen or helium.  For any given hydrogen mass fraction,\nincreasing Z leads to increasing molecular weight.  The dependence of \ntemperature on molecular weight is extremely steep\u2014it is approximately\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\ln{T_{eff}}}{\\partial \\ln{\\mu}} \\approx -26</math>.\nDecreasing Z by a factor of 10 shifts the track right, changing \n<math>\\ln{T_{eff}}</math> by about 0.05.\n\nChemical composition affects the Hayashi track in a few ways.  The\ntrack depends strongly on the atmosphere's opacity, and this opacity is\ndominated by the H- ion.  The abundance of the H- ion is proportional to the\ndensity of free electrons, which, in turn, is higher if there are more metals\nbecause metals are easier to ionize than hydrogen or helium.\n\n==Observational status==\n[[File:Ngc 2264.png|thumb|The young star cluster NGC 2264, with a large number of T Tauri stars contracting towards the main sequence.  The solid line represents the main sequence, while the two lines above that are the <math>10^{6.5}</math> yr (upper) and <math>10^{6.7}</math> yr (lower) isochrones.]]\n\nObservational evidence of the Hayashi track comes from color-magnitude plots\u2014the observational equivalent of HR diagrams\u2014of young star clusters.<ref name=Palla2012/> For\nHayashi, [[NGC 2264]] provided the first evidence of a population of contracting\nstars. In 2012, data from NGC 2264 was re-analyzed to account for dust\nreddening and extinction.  The resulting color-magnitude plot is shown at\nright.\n\nIn the upper diagram, the isochrones are curves along which stars of a certain \nage\nare expected to lie, assuming that all stars evolve along the Hayashi track.\nAn isochrone is created by taking stars of every conceivable mass, evolving\nthem forwards to the same age, and plotting all of them on the color-magnitude\ndiagram.\nMost of the stars in NGC 2264 are already on the main sequence (black line), \nbut a substantial population lies between the isochrones for 3.2 million and 5\nmillion years, indicating that the cluster is 3.2-5 million years old and a large population of T Tauri stars is still on their respective Hayashi tracks.\nSimilar results have been obtained for NGC 6530, IC 5146, and NGC 6611.<ref name=Palla2012/>\n\n[[File:T Tauri tracks.png|thumb|The numbered curves show the Hayashi tracks of stars of that mass (in solar masses).  The small circles represent observational data of T Tauri stars.  The bold curve to the right is the birthline, above which few stars exist.]]\n\nThe lower diagram shows Hayashi tracks for various masses, along with T Tauri\nobservations collected from a variety of sources.  Note the bold curve to\nthe right, representing a [[stellar birthline]].  Even though some Hayashi tracks\ntheoretically extend above the birthline, few stars are above it.  In effect,\nstars are 'born' onto the birthline before evolving downwards along their\nrespective Hayashi tracks.\n\nThe birthline exists because stars formed from overdense cores of giant molecular\nclouds in an inside-out manner.<ref name=Stahler1988/>  That is, a small central region first\ncollapses in on itself while the outer shell is still nearly static.  The outer\nenvelope then accretes onto the central protostar.  Before the accretion is \nover, the protostar is hidden from view, and therefore not plotted on the\ncolor-magnitude diagram.  When the envelope finishes accreting, the star is\nrevealed and appears on the birthline.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=struct_evol>{{Cite book  | title = Stellar structure and evolution | date = 2012 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 978-3-642-30255-8 | pages = 271\u2013282}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=interiors>{{Cite book  | last1 = Hansen | first1 = Carl J. | last2 = Kawaler | first2 = Steven D. | last3 = Trimble | first3 = Virginia. | title = Stellar interiors : physical principles, structure, and evolution | date = 2004 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-387-20089-7 | pages =  367\u2013374}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Palla2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Palla|first1=Francesco|title=1961\u20132011: Fifty years of Hayashi tracks|date=2012|pages=22\u201329|issn=0094-243X|doi=10.1063/1.4754323}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Stahler1988\">{{cite journal|last1=Stahler|first1=Steven W.|title=Understanding young stars - A history|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=100|date=1988|pages=1474|issn=0004-6280|doi=10.1086/132352|bibcode = 1988PASP..100.1474S }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hayashi1\">{{Cite journal\n| last = Hayashi\n| first = C.\n| title = Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction\n| journal = Publ.

While slowly contracting, the star follows the Hayashi track downwards, becoming several times less luminous but staying at roughly the same surface temperature, until either a [[radiative zone]] develops, at which point the star starts following the [[Henyey track]], or nuclear fusion begins, marking its entry onto the [[main sequence]].\n\nThe shape and position of the Hayashi track on the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram depends on the star's mass and chemical composition. For solar-mass stars, the track lies at a temperature of roughly 4000 K. Stars on the track are nearly fully convective and have their [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] dominated by hydrogen ions. Stars less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} are fully convective even on the main sequence, but their opacity begins to be dominated by [[Kramers' opacity law]] after nuclear fusion begins, thus moving them off the Hayashi track. Stars between 0.5 and {{Solar mass|3}} develop a radiative\nzone prior to reaching the main sequence. Stars between 3 and {{Solar mass|10}} are fully radiative at the beginning of the pre-main-sequence. Even heavier stars are born onto the main sequence, with no PMS evolution.<ref name=Palla2012/>\n\nAt an end of a low- or intermediate-mass star's life, the star follows an analogue of the Hayashi track, but in reverse\u2014it increases in luminosity, expands, and stays at roughly the same temperature, eventually becoming a [[red giant]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1961, Professor [[Chushiro Hayashi]] published two papers<ref name=hayashi1/><ref name=hayashi2/> that led to the concept of the [[pre-main-sequence]] and form the basis of the modern understanding of early stellar evolution. Hayashi realized that the existing model, in which stars are assumed to be in [[radiative equilibrium]] with no substantial convection zone, cannot explain the shape of the [[red giant branch]].<ref name=Stahler1988/>  He therefore replaced the model by including the effects of thick [[convection zone]]s on a star's interior.\n\nA few years prior, [[Donald Edward Osterbrock|Osterbrock]] proposed deep convection zones with efficient convection, analyzing them using the opacity of H- ions (the dominant opacity source in cool atmospheres) in temperatures below 5000K.  However, the earliest numerical models of Sun-like stars did not follow up on this work and continued to assume radiative equilibrium.<ref name=Palla2012/>\n\nIn his 1961 papers, Hayashi showed that the convective envelope of a star is determined by:\n\n<math>E = 4\\pi G^{3/2}(\\mu H/k)^{5/2}M^{1/2}R^{3/2}P/T^{5/2}</math>\n\nwhere E is unitless, and not the [[energy]].  Modelling stars as [[polytrope]]s with index 3/2\u2014in other words, assuming they follow a pressure-density relationship of <math>P=K\\rho^{5/3}</math>\u2014he found that E=45 is the maximum for a [[quasistatic process|quasistatic]] star.  If a star is not contracting rapidly, E=45 defines a curve on the HR diagram, to the right of which the star cannot exist.  He then computed the evolutionary tracks and [[Stellar isochrone|isochrones]] (luminosity-temperature distributions of stars at a given age) for a variety of stellar masses and noted that [[NGC2264]], a very young star cluster, fits the isochrones well.  In particular, he calculated much lower ages for solar-type stars in NGC2264 and predicted that these stars were rapidly contracting [[T Tauri stars]].\n\nIn 1962, Hayashi published a 183-page review of stellar evolution.  Here, he discussed the evolution of stars born in the forbidden region.  These stars rapidly contract due to gravity before settling to a quasistatic, fully convective state on the Hayashi tracks.\n\nIn 1965, numerical models by Iben and Ezer & Cameron realistically simulated pre-main-sequence evolution, including the [[Henyey track]] that stars follow after leaving the Hayashi track.  These standard PMS tracks can still be found in textbooks on stellar evolution.\n\n==Forbidden zone==\n{{See also|Hayashi limit}}\nThe '''forbidden zone''' is the region on the HR diagram to the right of the Hayashi track where no star can be in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], even those that are partially or fully radiative.  Newborn [[protostar]]s start out in this zone, but are not in hydrostatic equilibrium and will rapidly move towards the Hayashi track.\n\nBecause stars emit light via [[blackbody radiation]], the power per unit surface area they emit is given by the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]:\n\n:<math>j^{\\star} = \\sigma T^4</math>\nThe star's luminosity is therefore given by:\n:<math>L = 4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4</math>\n\nFor a given L, a lower temperature implies a larger radius, and vice versa. Thus, the Hayashi track separates the HR diagram into two regions: the allowed region to the left, with high temperatures and smaller radii for each luminosity, and the forbidden region to the right, with lower temperatures and correspondingly higher radii.  The [[Hayashi limit]] can refer to either the lower bound in temperature or the upper bound on radius defined by the Hayashi track.\n\nThe region to the right is forbidden because it can be shown that a star in the region must have a temperature gradient of:\n:<math>\\frac{d \\ln T}{d \\ln P} > 0.4</math>\nwhere <math>\\frac{d \\ln T}{d \\ln P} = 0.4</math> for a monatomic ideal gas undergoing [[adiabatic]] expansion or contraction.  A temperature gradient greater than 0.4 is therefore called superadiabatic.\n\nConsider a star with a superadiabatic gradient.  Imagine a parcel of gas that starts at radial position r, but moves upwards to r+dr in a sufficiently short time that it exchanges negligible heat with its surroundings\u2014in other words, the process is adiabatic.  The pressure of the surroundings, as well as that of the parcel, decreases by some amount dP.  The parcel's temperature changes by <math>dT = 0.4\\frac{T}{P}dP</math>.  The temperature of the surroundings also decreases, but by some amount dT' that is greater than dT.  The parcel therefore ends up being hotter than its surroundings.  Since the [[ideal gas law]] can be written <math>P = \\frac{\\rho RT}{\\mu}</math>, a higher temperature implies a lower density at the same pressure.  The parcel is therefore also less dense than its surroundings.  This will cause it to rise even more, and the parcel will become even less dense than its new surroundings.\n\nClearly, this situation is not stable.  In fact, a superadiabatic gradient causes [[convection]].  Convection tends to lower the temperature gradient because the rising parcel of gas will eventually be dispersed, dumping its excess thermal and kinetic energy into its surroundings and heating up said surroundings.  In stars, the convection process is known to be highly efficient, with a typical <math>\\frac{d \\ln T}{d \\ln P}</math> that only exceeds the adiabatic gradient by 1 part in 10 million.<ref name=struct_evol/>\n\nIf a star is placed in the forbidden zone, with a temperature gradient much greater than 0.4, it will experience rapid convection that brings the gradient down.  Since this convection will drastically change the star's pressure and temperature distribution, the star is not in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and will contract until it is.\n\nA star far to the left of the Hayashi track has a temperature gradient smaller than adiabatic. This means that if a parcel of gas rises a tiny bit, it will be more dense than its surroundings and sink back to where it came from. Convection therefore does not occur, and almost all energy output is carried radiatively.\n\n==Star formation==\nStars form when small regions of a [[giant molecular cloud]] collapse under their own gravity, becoming [[protostar]]s. The collapse releases gravitational energy, which heats up the protostar.  This process occurs on the [[Free fall|free-fall timescale]], which is roughly 100,000 years for solar-mass protostars, and ends when the protostar reaches approximately 4000 K.  This is known as the Hayashi boundary, and at this point, the protostar is on the Hayashi track.  At this point, they are known as [[T Tauri stars]] and continue to contract, but much more slowly.  As they contract, they decrease in luminosity because less surface area becomes available for emitting light. The Hayashi track gives the resulting change in temperature, which will be minimal compared to the change in luminosity because the Hayashi track is nearly vertical.  In other words, on the HR diagram, a T Tauri star starts out on the Hayashi track with a high luminosity and moves downward along the track as time passes.\n\nThe Hayashi track describes a fully [[convective]] star.  This is a good approximation for very young pre-main-sequence stars they are still cool and highly [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], so that [[radiative transport]] is insufficient to carry away the generated energy and convection must occur.  Stars less massive than {{Solar mass|0.5}} remain fully convective, and therefore remain on the Hayashi track, throughout their pre-main-sequence stage, joining the main sequence at the bottom of the Hayashi track. Stars heavier than {{Solar mass|0.5}} have higher interior temperatures, which decreases their central opacity and allows radiation to carry away large amounts of energy.  This allows a [[radiative zone]] to develop around the star's core. The star is then no longer on the Hayashi track, and experiences a period of rapidly increasing temperature at nearly constant luminosity.  This is called the [[Henyey track]], and ends when temperatures are high enough to ignite hydrogen fusion in the core.  The star is then on the [[main sequence]].\n\nLower-mass stars follow the Hayashi track until the track intersects with the main sequence, at which point hydrogen fusion begins and the star follows the main sequence.  Even lower-mass 'stars' never achieve the conditions necessary to fuse hydrogen and become [[brown dwarfs]].\n\n==Derivation==\nThe exact shape and position of the Hayashi track can only be computed\nnumerically using computer models.  Nevertheless, we can make an extremely\ncrude analytical argument that captures most of the track's properties.  The\nfollowing derivation loosely follows that of Kippenhahn, Weigert, and Weiss in\n''Stellar Structure and Evolution''.<ref name=struct_evol/>\n\nIn our\nsimple model, a star is assumed to consist of a fully convective interior\ninside of a fully radiative atmosphere.\n\nThe convective interior is assumed to be an ideal monatomic gas with a perfectly adiabatic temperature gradient:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\ln{T}}{d\\ln{P}} = 0.4</math>\n\nThis quantity is sometimes labelled <math>\\nabla</math>.  The following\nadiabatic equation therefore holds true for the entire interior:\n\n:<math>P^{1-\\gamma}T^{\\gamma} = C</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[adiabatic gamma]], which is 5/3 for an ideal\nmonatomic gas.  The ideal gas law says:\n\n:<math>P = NkT/V</math>\n:<math>= \\frac{\\rho kT}{\\mu H}</math>\n:<math>= (\\frac{k\\rho C}{\\mu H})^\\gamma</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the molecular weight per particle and H is (to a very good\napproximation) the mass of a hydrogen atom.  This equation represents a\n[[polytrope]] of index 1.5, since a polytrope is defined by \n<math>P = K\\rho^{1 + 1/n}</math>, where n=1.5 is the polytropic index.  Applying \nthe equation to the center of the star gives:\n<math>P_c = (\\frac{k\\rho_c C}{\\mu H})^\\gamma</math>\nWe can solve for C:\n:<math>C = \\frac{\\mu HP_c^{1/\\gamma}}{\\rho_c k}</math>\n\nBut for any polytrope, <math>P_c = W_n\\frac{GM^2}{R^4}</math>,\n<math>\\rho_c = K_n\\rho_{avg}</math>, and \n<math>R^{\\frac{3-n}{n}} M^{\\frac{n-1}{n}} = \\frac{K}{GN_n}</math>.  <math>W_n, K_n,\nN_n,</math> and K are all constants independent of pressure and density,\nand the average density is defined as \n<math>\\rho_{avg} \\equiv \\frac{M}{4/3 \\pi R^3}</math>.  Plugging all 3 equations\ninto the equation for C, we have:\n\n:<math> C \\sim M^{2-\\gamma} R^{3\\gamma - 4}</math>\n\nwhere all multiplicative constants have been ignored.  Recall that our original\ndefinition of C was:\n\n:<math>P^{1-\\gamma}T^\\gamma = C</math>\n\nWe therefore have, for any star of mass M and radius R:\n\n:<math>P^{1-\\gamma}T^\\gamma \\sim M^{2 - \\gamma} R^{3\\gamma - 4}</math>\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\ln P = \\frac{2-\\gamma}{1-\\gamma}\\ln M + \\frac{3\\gamma - 4}\n{1 - \\gamma}\\ln R - \\gamma \\ln T</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nWe need another relationship between P, T, M, and R, in order to eliminate P.\nThis relationship will come from the atmosphere model.\n\nThe atmosphere is assumed to be thin, with average [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] k.  Opacity is\ndefined to be optical depth divided by density. Thus, by definition, the\noptical depth of the stellar surface, also called the [[photosphere]], is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\tau}{dr} = k\\rho</math>\n:<math>\\tau = \\int_R^\\infty k\\rho dr</math>\n:<math> = k\\int_R^\\infty \\rho dr</math>\n\nwhere R is the stellar radius, also known as the position of the photosphere.\nThe pressure at the surface is:\n\n:<math>P_0 = \\int_R^\\infty g\\rho dr</math>\n:<math>= \\frac{GM}{R^2}\\int_R^\\infty \\rho dr</math>\n:<math> = \\frac{GM\\tau}{kR^2}</math>\n\nThe optical depth at the photosphere turns out to be <math>\\tau = 2/3</math>. By\ndefinition, the temperature of the photosphere is <math>T = T_{eff}</math> where effective\ntemperature is given by <math>L = 4\\pi R^2T_{eff}^4</math>.  Therefore,\nthe pressure is:\n\n:<math>P_0 = \\frac{GM}{R^2}\\frac{2}{3k}</math>\n\nWe can approximate the opacity to be:\n\n:<math>k = k_0P^aT^b</math>\n\nwhere a=1, b=3.  Plugging this into the pressure equation, we get:\n\n:<math>P_0 = const(\\frac{M}{R^2T_{eff}^b})^{\\frac{1}{a+1}}</math>\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\ln P_0 = \\ln{const} + \\frac{1}{a+1}(\\ln{M} - 2\\ln{R} - \nb\\ln{T_{eff}}) </math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nFinally, we need to eliminate R and introduce L, the luminosity.  This can be\ndone with the equation:\n\n:<math>L = 4\\pi R^2\\sigma T_{eff}^4</math>\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\ln{R} = 0.5\\ln{L} - 2\\ln{T_{eff}} + const\n</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nEquation {{EquationNote|1}} and {{EquationNote|2}} can now be combined by\nsetting <math>T=T_{eff}</math> and <math>P=P_0</math> in Equation 1, then eliminating <math>P_0</math>.\nR can be eliminated using Equation {{EquationNote|3}}.  After some algebra,\nand after setting <math>\\gamma = 5/3</math>, we get:\n\n:<math>\\ln{T_{eff}} = A\\ln{L} + B\\ln{M} + const</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>A = \\frac{0.75a-0.25}{5.5a+b+1.5}</math>\n:<math>B = \\frac{0.5a + 1.5}{5.5a+b+1.5}</math>\n\nIn cool stellar atmospheres (T < 5000 K) like those of newborn stars, \nthe dominant source of opacity is the H- ion, for which \n<math>a \\approx 1</math> and <math>b \\approx 3</math>, we get \n<math>A = 0.05</math> and <math>B = 0.2</math>.\n\nSince A is much smaller than\n1, the Hayashi track is extremely steep: if the luminosity changes by a factor\nof 2, the temperature only changes by 4 percent.  The fact that B is positive\nindicates that the Hayashi track shifts left on the HR diagram, towards higher\ntemperatures, as mass increases.  Although this model is extremely crude, these\nqualitative observations are fully supported by numerical simulations.\n\nAt high temperatures, the atmosphere's opacity begins to be dominated by\n[[Kramers' opacity law]] instead of the H- ion, with a=1 and b=-4.5  In that\ncase, A=0.2 in our crude model, far higher than 0.05, and the star is no longer\non the Hayashi track.\n\nIn ''Stellar Interiors'', Hansen, Kawaler, and Trimble go through a similar\nderivation without neglecting multiplicative constants,<ref name=interiors/> \nand arrived at:\n\n:<math>T_{eff} = (2600 K)\\mu^{13/51}(\\frac{M}{M_{\\odot}})^{7/51}(\\frac{L}{L_{\\odot}})^{1/102}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the molecular weight per particle.  The authors note that the coefficient of 2600K is too\nlow\u2014it should be around 4000K\u2014but this equation nevertheless shows that\ntemperature is nearly independent of luminosity.\n\n==Numerical results==\n[[File:Hayashi composition.png|thumb|Hayashi tracks of a {{Solar mass|0.8}} star with helium mass fraction 0.245, for 3 different metallicities]]\n\nThe diagram at the top of this article shows numerically computed stellar \nevolution\ntracks for various masses.  The vertical portions of each track is the Hayashi\ntrack.  The endpoints of each track lie on the main sequence.\nThe horizontal segments for higher-mass stars show the [[Henyey track]].\n\nIt is approximately true that: \n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\ln{T_{eff}}}{\\partial \\ln{M}} \\approx 0.1</math>.\n\nThe diagram to the right shows how Hayashi tracks change with changes in\nchemical composition.  Z is the star's [[metallicity]], the mass fraction not\naccounted for by hydrogen or helium.  For any given hydrogen mass fraction,\nincreasing Z leads to increasing molecular weight.  The dependence of \ntemperature on molecular weight is extremely steep\u2014it is approximately\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\ln{T_{eff}}}{\\partial \\ln{\\mu}} \\approx -26</math>.\nDecreasing Z by a factor of 10 shifts the track right, changing \n<math>\\ln{T_{eff}}</math> by about 0.05.\n\nChemical composition affects the Hayashi track in a few ways.  The\ntrack depends strongly on the atmosphere's opacity, and this opacity is\ndominated by the H- ion.  The abundance of the H- ion is proportional to the\ndensity of free electrons, which, in turn, is higher if there are more metals\nbecause metals are easier to ionize than hydrogen or helium.\n\n==Observational status==\n[[File:Ngc 2264.png|thumb|The young star cluster NGC 2264, with a large number of T Tauri stars contracting towards the main sequence.

Note the bold curve to\nthe right, representing a [[stellar birthline]].  Even though some Hayashi tracks\ntheoretically extend above the birthline, few stars are above it.  In effect,\nstars are 'born' onto the birthline before evolving downwards along their\nrespective Hayashi tracks.\n\nThe birthline exists because stars formed from overdense cores of giant molecular\nclouds in an inside-out manner.<ref name=Stahler1988/>  That is, a small central region first\ncollapses in on itself while the outer shell is still nearly static.  The outer\nenvelope then accretes onto the central protostar.  Before the accretion is \nover, the protostar is hidden from view, and therefore not plotted on the\ncolor-magnitude diagram.  When the envelope finishes accreting, the star is\nrevealed and appears on the birthline.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=struct_evol>{{Cite book  | title = Stellar structure and evolution | date = 2012 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 978-3-642-30255-8 | pages = 271\u2013282}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=interiors>{{Cite book  | last1 = Hansen | first1 = Carl J. | last2 = Kawaler | first2 = Steven D. | last3 = Trimble | first3 = Virginia. | title = Stellar interiors : physical principles, structure, and evolution | date = 2004 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-387-20089-7 | pages =  367\u2013374}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Palla2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Palla|first1=Francesco|title=1961\u20132011: Fifty years of Hayashi tracks|date=2012|pages=22\u201329|issn=0094-243X|doi=10.1063/1.4754323}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Stahler1988\">{{cite journal|last1=Stahler|first1=Steven W.|title=Understanding young stars - A history|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=100|date=1988|pages=1474|issn=0004-6280|doi=10.1086/132352|bibcode = 1988PASP..100.1474S }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hayashi1\">{{Cite journal\n| last = Hayashi\n| first = C.\n| title = Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction\n| journal = Publ.

This curved path was shown by [[Galileo]] to be a [[parabola]], but may also be a line in the special case when it is thrown directly upwards. The study of such motions is called [[ballistics]], and such a trajectory is a [[Ballistic Trajectories|ballistic trajectory]]. The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward, thus imparting to the object a downward [[acceleration]]. Because of the object's [[inertia]], no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity [[Vector component|component]] of the object. Taking other forces into account, such as [[friction]] from [[aerodynamic drag]] or internal propulsion such as in a [[rocket]], requires additional analysis. A ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight, and whose subsequent course is governed by the laws of classical mechanics.\n\nBallistics (gr. \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ('ba'llein'), \"to throw\") is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, especially bullets, unguided bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.\n\n[[Image:Mplwp ballistic trajectories velocities.svg|right|thumb|320px|Trajectories of a projectile with air drag and varying initial velocities]]\n\nThe elementary equations of ballistics neglect nearly every factor except for initial velocity and an assumed constant gravitational acceleration. Practical solutions of a ballistics problem often require considerations of air resistance, cross winds, target motion, varying acceleration due to gravity, and in such problems as launching a rocket from one point on the Earth to another, the rotation of the Earth. Detailed mathematical solutions of practical problems typically do not have [[closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions, and therefore require [[numerical methods]] to address.\n\n== The initial velocity ==\nLet the projectile be launched with an [[Velocity|initial velocity]] <math> \\mathbf{v} (0) \\equiv \\mathbf{v}_0 </math>, which can be expressed as the sum of horizontal and vertical components as follows:\n:<math> \\mathbf{v}_0 = v_{0x}\\mathbf{i} + v_{0y}\\mathbf{j} </math>.\nThe components <math> v_{0x} </math> and <math> v_{0y} </math> can be found if the initial launch angle, <math> \\theta </math>, is known:\n:<math> v_{0x} = v_0\\cos\\theta </math>,\n:<math> v_{0y} = v_0\\sin\\theta </math>\n\n== Kinematic quantities of projectile motion ==\nIn projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other. This is the principle of ''compound motion'' established by [[Galileo]] in 1638,<ref>Galileo Galilei, ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', Leiden, 1638, p.249</ref> and used by him to prove the parabolic form of projectile motion <ref>Nolte, David D., Galileo Unbound (Oxford University Press, 2018) pp. 39-63.</ref>.\n[[File:Compound Motion.gif|thumb|The horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's velocity are independent of each other.]]\nA ballistic trajectory is a parabola with homogeneous acceleration, such as in a space ship with constant acceleration in absence of other forces. On Earth the acceleration changes magnitude with altitude and direction with latitude/longitude. This causes an [[Ellipse|elliptic]] trajectory, which is very close to a parabola on a small scale. However, if an object was thrown and the Earth was suddenly replaced with a [[black hole]] of equal mass, it would become obvious that the ballistic trajectory is part of an elliptic [[orbit]] around that black hole, and not a parabola that extends to infinity. At higher speeds the trajectory can also be circular, parabolic or [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] (unless distorted by other objects like the Moon or the Sun). In this article a homogeneous acceleration is assumed.\n\n=== Acceleration ===\nSince there is only acceleration in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to <math> \\mathbf{v}_0 \\cos\\theta </math>. The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal to <var>g</var>.<ref>The <var>g</var> is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]].

In other words, the rocket travels higher and by doing so it uses more energy to get to the same landing point. This may be done for various reasons such as increasing distance to the horizon to give greater viewing/communication range or for changing the angle with which a missile will impact on landing. Lofted trajectories are sometimes used in both missile rocketry and in [[spaceflight]].<ref>[https://definedterm.com/a/document/10803 Ballistic Missile Defense, Glossary, v. 3.0], [[US Department of Defense]], June 1997.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Projectile Motion}}\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Motion of an object given an initial velocity which then follows a path determined entirely by gravity}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Expert needed|reason=Contains various high-level info without any references.|date=November 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}\n}}\n[[File:ParabolicWaterTrajectory.jpg|thumb|250px|Parabolic water motion trajectory]]\n[[File:Ferde hajitas2.svg|thumb|250px|Components of initial velocity of parabolic throwing]]\n'''Projectile motion''' is a form of [[motion (physics)|motion]] experienced by an object or particle (a [[projectile]]) that is projected near the Earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of [[gravity]] only (in particular, the effects of [[air resistance]] are assumed to be negligible). This curved path was shown by [[Galileo]] to be a [[parabola]], but may also be a line in the special case when it is thrown directly upwards. The study of such motions is called [[ballistics]], and such a trajectory is a [[Ballistic Trajectories|ballistic trajectory]]. The only force of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward, thus imparting to the object a downward [[acceleration]]. Because of the object's [[inertia]], no external horizontal force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity [[Vector component|component]] of the object. Taking other forces into account, such as [[friction]] from [[aerodynamic drag]] or internal propulsion such as in a [[rocket]], requires additional analysis. A ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight, and whose subsequent course is governed by the laws of classical mechanics.\n\nBallistics (gr. \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ('ba'llein'), \"to throw\") is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, especially bullets, unguided bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.\n\n[[Image:Mplwp ballistic trajectories velocities.svg|right|thumb|320px|Trajectories of a projectile with air drag and varying initial velocities]]\n\nThe elementary equations of ballistics neglect nearly every factor except for initial velocity and an assumed constant gravitational acceleration. Practical solutions of a ballistics problem often require considerations of air resistance, cross winds, target motion, varying acceleration due to gravity, and in such problems as launching a rocket from one point on the Earth to another, the rotation of the Earth. Detailed mathematical solutions of practical problems typically do not have [[closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions, and therefore require [[numerical methods]] to address.\n\n== The initial velocity ==\nLet the projectile be launched with an [[Velocity|initial velocity]] <math> \\mathbf{v} (0) \\equiv \\mathbf{v}_0 </math>, which can be expressed as the sum of horizontal and vertical components as follows:\n:<math> \\mathbf{v}_0 = v_{0x}\\mathbf{i} + v_{0y}\\mathbf{j} </math>.\nThe components <math> v_{0x} </math> and <math> v_{0y} </math> can be found if the initial launch angle, <math> \\theta </math>, is known:\n:<math> v_{0x} = v_0\\cos\\theta </math>,\n:<math> v_{0y} = v_0\\sin\\theta </math>\n\n== Kinematic quantities of projectile motion ==\nIn projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other. This is the principle of ''compound motion'' established by [[Galileo]] in 1638,<ref>Galileo Galilei, ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', Leiden, 1638, p.249</ref> and used by him to prove the parabolic form of projectile motion <ref>Nolte, David D., Galileo Unbound (Oxford University Press, 2018) pp. 39-63.</ref>.\n[[File:Compound Motion.gif|thumb|The horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's velocity are independent of each other.]]\nA ballistic trajectory is a parabola with homogeneous acceleration, such as in a space ship with constant acceleration in absence of other forces. On Earth the acceleration changes magnitude with altitude and direction with latitude/longitude. This causes an [[Ellipse|elliptic]] trajectory, which is very close to a parabola on a small scale. However, if an object was thrown and the Earth was suddenly replaced with a [[black hole]] of equal mass, it would become obvious that the ballistic trajectory is part of an elliptic [[orbit]] around that black hole, and not a parabola that extends to infinity. At higher speeds the trajectory can also be circular, parabolic or [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] (unless distorted by other objects like the Moon or the Sun). In this article a homogeneous acceleration is assumed.\n\n=== Acceleration ===\nSince there is only acceleration in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to <math> \\mathbf{v}_0 \\cos\\theta </math>. The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal to <var>g</var>.<ref>The <var>g</var> is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]]. (<math> 9.81 m/s^2 </math> near the surface of the Earth).</ref> The components of the acceleration are:\n\n:<math> a_x = 0 </math>,\n:<math> a_y = g </math>.\n\n=== Velocity ===\nThe horizontal component of the [[velocity]] of the object remains unchanged throughout the motion. The vertical component of the velocity changes linearly,<ref>decreasing when the object goes upward, and increasing when it goes downward</ref> because the acceleration due to gravity is constant.

In other words, the rocket travels higher and by doing so it uses more energy to get to the same landing point. This may be done for various reasons such as increasing distance to the horizon to give greater viewing/communication range or for changing the angle with which a missile will impact on landing. Lofted trajectories are sometimes used in both missile rocketry and in [[spaceflight]].<ref>[https://definedterm.com/a/document/10803 Ballistic Missile Defense, Glossary, v. 3.0], [[US Department of Defense]], June 1997.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Projectile Motion}}\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion"}
