{"title_page": "Allentown Railroad", "text_new": "{{Infobox rail | gauge={{Track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}|\nrailroad_name=Allentown Railroad|\nlocale=[[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]], and [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]]|\nstart_year=1870|\nend_year=December 31, 1945|\nsuccessor_line=[[Reading Company]]|\nhq_city=[[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]|\n}}\nThe '''Allentown Railroad''' was a rail line proposed in the 1850s to connect the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] at [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s main line across the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. Though grading was almost entirely finished, the project was halted by the [[Panic of 1857]], and the completion of the [[East Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1859 made the Allentown Railroad's proposed line largely redundant. As a result, track was never laid on most of the line. The small portion that did became a branchline of the [[Reading Company]] from [[Topton, Pennsylvania|Topton]] to [[Kutztown, Pennsylvania|Kutztown]], and was nominally owned by the Allentown Railroad until the Reading dissolved it in 1945 to simplify corporate bookkeeping. Other Reading subsidiaries also laid track on parts of the right-of-way elsewhere along the route.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) had reached [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey|Phillipsburg]] in 1852, on the outskirts of the [[Lehigh Valley]], and anticipated extension to Allentown. If a direct route could be built from Allentown to the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]], western traffic could reach New York faster by this route than by detouring through [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and coming north over the [[Camden and Amboy Railroad]].\n\nSuch a route would run parallel to the mountains in the region, and a lateral coal railroad already extended west from the Susquehanna. The [[Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company]] (D&S) operated a railroad which connected with the PRR at [[Rockville, Pennsylvania|Rockville]] (where their main line crossed the Susquehanna), ran north along the river to [[Dauphin, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]], and turned northeast to run up Stony Valley to the [[Rausch Gap, Pennsylvania|Rausch Gap]] coal mines. It proved to be a willing partner in the plan.\n\n==Construction of route==\n[[File:Windsor Castle Tunnel.JPG|200px|right|thumb|An unfinished tunnel on the Allentown Railroad in 2009.]]\nThe D&S and CNJ jointly procured a charter, issued April 19, 1853, for the '''Allentown Railroad''', which would construct the first segment of the route. It would run from Allentown to the Reading main line between [[Auburn, Pennsylvania|Auburn]] and [[Port Clinton, Pennsylvania|Port Clinton]], with a branch into Kutztown.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=455}} The Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company had charter rights to connect with any rail line in Schuylkill County, and it began building an extension of its line, starting from the Reading at Auburn and driving westward. By November 4, 1853, the new line of the D&S was open from Auburn to [[Pine Grove, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove]], following [[Bear Creek (Schuylkill River)|Bear Creek]] to its headwaters and then dropping down [[Lower Little Swatara Creek]]. Work continued on the more difficult middle segment, which required heavier grading to climb along the slopes of [[Second Mountain]] and enter Stony Valley at Fishing Creek Gap.\n\n{{Anchor|Auburn and Port Clinton Railroad|Auburn and Allentown Railroad}}On March 13, 1854, a second railroad, the '''Auburn and Port Clinton Railroad''', was chartered for the project. This would connect the D&S at Auburn with the Allentown RR at Port Clinton,{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=455}} running parallel to the Reading main line along the [[Schuylkill River]]. The combined railroads were sometimes unofficially referred to as the '''Auburn and Allentown Railroad'''. On April 13, 1854, the charters of both the Allentown and the A&PC railroads were amended to allow them to merge with the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]],{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=455}} then building down through Allentown towards [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] (across the river from Phillipsburg). The line from Pine Grove to Rausch Gap was completed in June, and the D&S ran its first through train.\n\nIn 1855, work began in earnest on the Allentown Railroad itself. The route chosen left Allentown in a southwesterly direction, passing through [[Dorneyville, Pennsylvania|Dorneyville]], [[Wescosville, Pennsylvania|Wescosville]], [[Trexlertown, Pennsylvania|Trexlertown]], and [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania|Breinigsville]]. Ducking through Topton, it ran directly through Kutztown and followed [[Sacony Creek]] through the hills to [[Virginville, Pennsylvania|Virginville]]. From thence it followed small streams west and north to [[Windsor Castle, Pennsylvania|Windsor Castle]], site of the line's one tunnel. It was to be {{convert|1100|ft|m}} long, with rubble masonry portals. Leaving the tunnel, it would skirt the edges of [[Hamburg, Pennsylvania|Hamburg]] and push through the gorge of the Schuylkill to reach Port Clinton. By July 1856, the CNJ was prepared to abandon the project in favor of a rival route, via [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. However, the other investors pressed on. The Auburn & Port Clinton was merged into the Allentown Railroad on January 1, 1857.  The [[Panic of 1857]], however, brought work to a halt. The D&S was foreclosed and reorganized on April 1, 1859, as the [[Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad]], under control of the Reading. On May 11, 1859, the [[East Pennsylvania Railroad]] opened, connecting Allentown and Reading.  From Reading, traffic could either pass north to Auburn and thence over the Schuylkill and Susquehanna, or west over the [[Lebanon Valley Railroad]] to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. <!-- charter amended 3-24-1860 to connect with MH&SH, compete with RDG -->The distance cut off by the direct route from Port Clinton to Allentown was minimal, so when the Reading gained control of the Allentown RR on July 12, 1860,{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=455}} it saw no reason to complete it.\n\n==Reading and later operation==\nThe Reading briefly considered a revival of the project in 1869, but on May 1, 1869, it obtained a lease of the East Penn.

Though grading was almost entirely finished, the project was halted by the [[Panic of 1857]], and the completion of the [[East Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1859 made the Allentown Railroad's proposed line largely redundant. As a result, track was never laid on most of the line. The small portion that did became a branchline of the [[Reading Company]] from [[Topton, Pennsylvania|Topton]] to [[Kutztown, Pennsylvania|Kutztown]], and was nominally owned by the Allentown Railroad until the Reading dissolved it in 1945 to simplify corporate bookkeeping. Other Reading subsidiaries also laid track on parts of the right-of-way elsewhere along the route.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) had reached [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey|Phillipsburg]] in 1852, on the outskirts of the [[Lehigh Valley]], and anticipated extension to Allentown. If a direct route could be built from Allentown to the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]], western traffic could reach New York faster by this route than by detouring through [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and coming north over the [[Camden and Amboy Railroad]].\n\nSuch a route would run parallel to the mountains in the region, and a lateral coal railroad already extended west from the Susquehanna. The [[Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company]] (D&S) operated a railroad which connected with the PRR at [[Rockville, Pennsylvania|Rockville]] (where their main line crossed the Susquehanna), ran north along the river to [[Dauphin, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]], and turned northeast to run up Stony Valley to the [[Rausch Gap, Pennsylvania|Rausch Gap]] coal mines. It proved to be a willing partner in the plan.\n\n==Construction of route==\n[[File:Windsor Castle Tunnel.JPG|200px|right|thumb|An unfinished tunnel on the Allentown Railroad in 2009.]]\nThe D&S and CNJ jointly procured a charter, issued April 19, 1853, for the '''Allentown Railroad''', which would construct the first segment of the route. It would run from Allentown to the Reading main line between [[Auburn, Pennsylvania|Auburn]] and [[Port Clinton, Pennsylvania|Port Clinton]], with a branch into Kutztown.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=455}} The Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company had charter rights to connect with any rail line in Schuylkill County, and it began building an extension of its line, starting from the Reading at Auburn and driving westward. By November 4, 1853, the new line of the D&S was open from Auburn to [[Pine Grove, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove]], following [[Bear Creek (Schuylkill River)|Bear Creek]] to its headwaters and then dropping down [[Lower Little Swatara Creek]]. Work continued on the more difficult middle segment, which required heavier grading to climb along the slopes of [[Second Mountain]] and enter Stony Valley at Fishing Creek Gap.\n\n{{Anchor|Auburn and Port Clinton Railroad|Auburn and Allentown Railroad}}On March 13, 1854, a second railroad, the '''Auburn and Port Clinton Railroad''', was chartered for the project. This would connect the D&S at Auburn with the Allentown RR at Port Clinton,{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=455}} running parallel to the Reading main line along the [[Schuylkill River]]. The combined railroads were sometimes unofficially referred to as the '''Auburn and Allentown Railroad'''. On April 13, 1854, the charters of both the Allentown and the A&PC railroads were amended to allow them to merge with the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]],{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=455}} then building down through Allentown towards [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] (across the river from Phillipsburg).
