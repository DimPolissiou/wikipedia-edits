Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest. During the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine force]], hunting for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines and mostly active in the [[GIUK gap]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], its focus has returned to [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] operations [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|around the world]] and it remains one of the world's foremost [[blue-water navy|blue-water navies]].<ref>Hyde-Price, ''European Security'', pp. 105\u2013106.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Navy: Britain\u2019s Trident for a Global Agenda |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |accessdate=4 November 2006 |quote=Britannia, with her shield and trident, is the very symbol, not only of the Royal Navy, but also of British global power.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]]. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

However, while subsequent French invasion schemes came to nothing, England's naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] allies. Such raids halted finally only with the occupation of northern France by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 91\u201397, 99\u2013116, 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] deserves a large share of credit in fostering sea power.

This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal [[man-of-war]] near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]].

It was undertaken by the [[Company of Scotland]], who created a fleet of five ships, including ''Caledonia'' and ''St. Andrew'', all built or chartered in Holland and Hamburg. It sailed to the [[Isthmus of Darien]] in 1698, but the venture failed and only one ship returned to Scotland.<ref>A. I. MacInnes and A. H.

Amphibious operations by the Anglo-Dutch fleet brought about the capture of [[Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and a number of Spanish mainland ports, most importantly [[Barcelona]]. While most of these gains were turned over to the Habsburgs, Britain held on to [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]], which were retained in the peace settlement, providing the Navy with Mediterranean bases. Early in the war French naval squadrons had done considerable damage to English and Dutch commercial convoys. However, a major victory over France and Spain at [[Battle of Vigo Bay|Vigo Bay]] (1702), further successes in battle, and the scuttling of the entire French Mediterranean fleet at [[Toulon]] in 1707 virtually cleared the Navy's opponents from the seas for the latter part of the war.

The war saw a series of inconclusive battles in the Atlantic and Caribbean, in which the Navy failed to achieve the decisive victories needed to secure the supply lines of British forces in North America and to cut off the colonial rebels from outside support.<ref>Rodger, ''Command'', pp. 330\u2013351.</ref> The most important operation of the war came in 1781 when, in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], the British fleet failed to lift the French blockade of Lord Cornwallis's army, resulting in Cornwallis's surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]].<ref>Rodger, ''Command'', pp. 351\u2013352.</ref> Although this disaster effectively concluded the fighting in North America, hostilities continued in the Indian Ocean, where the French were prevented from re-establishing a meaningful foothold in India, and in the Caribbean.

Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals.

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|title=British naval convoy system introduced|publisher=History|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051642/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}]]\nIn the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

The re-armament of the Royal Navy was well under way by this point; the Royal Navy had begun construction of the still treaty-affected and undergunned [[King George V-class battleship (1939)|new battleships]] and its first full-sized purpose-built aircraft carriers. In addition to new construction, several existing old battleships (whose gun power offset to a significant extent the weakly armed new battleships), battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed, and anti-aircraft weaponry reinforced, while new technologies, such as [[ASDIC]], [[Huff-Duff]] and [[hydrophones]], were developed. The Navy had lost control of naval aviation when the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] was merged with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to form the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1918, but regained control of ship-board aircraft with the return of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] to Naval control in 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |title=The History of the Fleet Air Arm Officers Association, FAAOA |work=fleetairarmoa.org |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115613/http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |archive-date=18 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131945===\n{{Main|Naval history of World War II}}\n[[File:HM King George VI greeting the Flag Officers of the Home Fleet on board the flagship HMS DUKE OF YORK at Scapa Flow, 16 August 1943.

A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf-packs]]\", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of [[escort carrier]]s, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of [[Bletchley Park]]. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in [[Arctic convoys of World War II|the Arctic]], where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on [[Malta convoys|Convoys to Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|title=Operation Pedestal|publisher=Melbourne Star|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223001713/http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Far East. Naval supremacy was essential to amphibious operations such as the invasions of [[Operation Torch|Northwest Africa]], [[Operation Husky|Sicily]], [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]].

All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry. A modest new construction programme was initiated with some new carriers ([[1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier|''Majestic''-]] and {{sclass-|Centaur|aircraft carrier|0}} light carriers, and {{sclass-|Audacious|aircraft carrier|0}} large carriers, such as {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}}, being completed between 1948 through 1958), along with three {{sclass-|Tiger|cruiser|0}} cruisers (completed 1959\u20131961), the {{sclass-|Daring|destroyer|1||1949}}s in the 1950s, and finally the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer|0}} guided missile destroyers completed in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Purvis|first=M.

A plan was drawn up for three large aircraft carriers, each displacing about 60,000&nbsp;tons; the plan was designated [[CVA-01]]. These carriers would be able to operate the latest aircraft coming into service and keep the Royal Navy's place as a major naval power. The new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government that came to power in 1964 was determined to cut defence expenditure as a means to reduce public spending, and in the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] the project was cancelled.<ref>Eric J. Grove, ''Vanguard to Trident'', [[Naval Institute Press]]/The Bodley Head, London, 1987</ref> The existing carriers (all built during, or just after World War II) were refitted, two ({{HMS|Bulwark|R08|2}} and {{HMS|Albion|R07|2}}) becoming ''commando'' carriers, and four ({{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}, {{HMS|Eagle|R05|2}}, and {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|2}}) being completed or rebuilt.

By the early 1980s, only {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}} survived and received a refit (just in time for the [[Falklands War]]), to operate [[Sea Harriers]]. She operated along with three much smaller {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|2}}s, and the fleet was now centred around anti-submarine warfare in the north Atlantic as opposed to its former position with worldwide strike capability.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the Royal Navy surface fleet continues to reduce in size.

Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated \"HMS\". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a [[pennant number]] which in part denotes its role.

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest. During the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine force]], hunting for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines and mostly active in the [[GIUK gap]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], its focus has returned to [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] operations [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|around the world]] and it remains one of the world's foremost [[blue-water navy|blue-water navies]].<ref>Hyde-Price, ''European Security'', pp. 105\u2013106.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Navy: Britain\u2019s Trident for a Global Agenda |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |accessdate=4 November 2006 |quote=Britannia, with her shield and trident, is the very symbol, not only of the Royal Navy, but also of British global power.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]]. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

Early in the war French plans for an invasion of England failed when [[Edward III of England]] destroyed the French fleet in the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 93\u201399.</ref> Major fighting was thereafter confined to French soil and England's naval capabilities sufficed to transport armies and supplies safely to their continental destinations. However, while subsequent French invasion schemes came to nothing, England's naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] allies. Such raids halted finally only with the occupation of northern France by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 91\u201397, 99\u2013116, 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] deserves a large share of credit in fostering sea power.

This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal [[man-of-war]] near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]].

Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Due to British leadership in the [[Industrial Revolution]], the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|title=How did Britain come to rule the waves?|publisher=History Extra|accessdate=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307054023/https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Warrior armoured frigate 9,137 tons, Royal Navy (first armour-plated, iron-hulled warship.)

The Navy's [[Northern Patrol]] closed off access to the [[North Sea]], while the [[Dover Patrol]] closed off access to the [[English Channel]]. The Navy also mined the North Sea. As well as closing off the Imperial German Navy's access to the Atlantic, the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from [[German Empire|Germany]]. The blockade was maintained during the eight months after the armistice was agreed to force Germany to end the war and sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>Osbourne, Eric W. (2004).

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|title=British naval convoy system introduced|publisher=History|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051642/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}]]\nIn the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf-packs]]\", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of [[escort carrier]]s, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of [[Bletchley Park]]. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in [[Arctic convoys of World War II|the Arctic]], where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on [[Malta convoys|Convoys to Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|title=Operation Pedestal|publisher=Melbourne Star|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223001713/http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Far East.

All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the Royal Navy surface fleet continues to reduce in size. A 2013 report found that the current RN was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|title=Royal Navy is now 'too small' to protect Britain.|author=John Ingham|work=Express|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023222150/http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|archive-date=23 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy also took part in the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo conflict]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan Campaign]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the last of which saw RN warships [[Naval Gunfire Support|bombard]] positions in support of the [[Al Faw Peninsula]] landings by [[Royal Marines]]. In August 2005, the Royal Navy rescued seven Russians stranded in a submarine off the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]. The Navy's [[Scorpio 45]] remote-controlled mini-sub freed the Russian submarine from the fishing nets and cables that had held it for three days.

The carrier ''Ark Royal'' and the remaining Type 22 frigates were all removed from service and sold for scrap. {{HMS|Illustrious|R06|6}} however, was retained through to 2014 in the [[Landing Platform Helicopter|LPH]] role, until ''Ocean'' completed her refit.

Navies of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries [[Commonwealth realm|where the British monarch is also head of state]] include their national name, e.g. [[Royal Australian Navy]]. Some navies of other monarchies, such as the ''Koninklijke Marine'' ([[Royal Netherlands Navy]]) and ''Kungliga Flottan'' ([[Royal Swedish Navy]]), are also called \"Royal Navy\" in their own language. The Danish Navy stands out with the term Royal incorporated in its official name (Royal Danish Navy), but only using the term \"Fl\u00e5den\" (Navy) in everyday speech.<ref>most books on the subject of the Royal Danish Navy</ref> The French Navy, despite France being a republic since 1870, is often nicknamed ''\"La Royale\"'' (literally: The Royal).<ref>{{Cite book|first=Jean|last=Randier|year=2006|title=La Royale : L'histoire illustr\u00e9e de la Marine nationale fran\u00e7aise|isbn=978-2-35261-022-9}}</ref>\n\n===Of ships===\n{{Main|List of ships of the Royal Navy}}\n{{See also|List of active Royal Navy ships|Naming conventions for destroyers of the Royal Navy|Type system of the Royal Navy}}\nRoyal Navy ships in commission are prefixed since 1789 with [[Her Majesty's Ship]] ([[His Majesty's Ship]]), abbreviated to \"HMS\"; for example, {{HMS|Beagle}}. Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated \"HMS\". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a [[pennant number]] which in part denotes its role. For example, the destroyer {{HMS|Daring|D32|}} displays the pennant number 'D32'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |title=HMS Daring |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=15 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913114641/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |archive-date=13 September 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Ranks, rates, and Insignia==\n{{See also|Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy ratings rank insignia}}\nThe Royal Navy ranks, rates and insignia form part of the uniform of the Royal Navy.

In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO</ref> This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO</ref>\n\nThe project cost $80&nbsp;million, about $40&nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.<ref name=\"WHC-history\">\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect cultural heritage.<ref name=\"WHC-history\"/>\n\n===Convention and background===\nThe United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a \"World Heritage Trust\" to preserve \"the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry\". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a \"snapshot\" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.\n\nBased on the draft convention that UNESCO had initiated, a single text was eventually agreed on by all parties, and the \"Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.<ref>\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO</ref>\n\nThe project cost $80&nbsp;million, about $40&nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.<ref name=\"WHC-history\">\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect cultural heritage.<ref name=\"WHC-history\"/>\n\n===Convention and background===\nThe United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a \"World Heritage Trust\" to preserve \"the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry\". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a \"snapshot\" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.\n\nBased on the draft convention that UNESCO had initiated, a single text was eventually agreed on by all parties, and the \"Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.<ref>\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

The Lloyds moved to Scotland for three years because of John's work, and it was there that Matthew picked up [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[soccer]] playing for his [[Currie]] club.\n\nLloyd attended St Martin De Porres Parish Primary School in [[Avondale Heights]] before moving to [[St. Bernard's College, Melbourne]].<ref>[http://sbc.melb.catholic.edu.au/groups/oc/wof.html St Bernard's Old Collegians Wall of Fame]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe supported the [[Fitzroy Football Club]] when he was young because in the first game he attended, Fitzroy player [[Bernie Quinlan]] kicked nine goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=37730 |title=Unforgettable time for Lloyd |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\nHe had an huge ambition in his early days, playing AFL as a kid and dreamt of becoming a player!?\n\n==Career==\n\n===AFL===\nLloyd was drafted into the AFL as a 16-year-old in the [[1994 AFL Draft|1995 Pre-season Draft]] as a \"compensatory selection\" that was awarded to Essendon by the AFL in return for losing [[Todd Ridley]] to the newly formed [[Fremantle Football Club]]. The Bombers picked up what would be one of their all-time greats for a relative pittance in the draft. Lloyd was heralded as a future football star after his AFL debut in Round 14, 1995, where he scored a goal with his first kick in league football and three for the match.\n\nThe key features of Lloyd's game were his powerful [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]s on the lead (particularly overhead), his use of his body in a defensive capacity and accurate goal kicking, particularly from [[set shot]]s on his left foot. He converted a large majority of set shots inside the [[50-metre arc]] and kicked further than 50 metres on a regular basis.\n\nLloyd was known for his ritual when taking set shots at goal. Almost every time, he took time to go far back on the mark, pull both his socks up, and then grab some grass and throw it into the air to measure the wind and take a very long run-up before kicking. In 2006, the AFL introduced a \"shot clock\" to limit the amount of time that players had to take set shots; although Lloyd's ritual was not the longest in the league, its quirks made it so well known that the rule became commonly known as the \"Lloyd Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/lloyd-rule-to-speed-up-goalkicking/2005/11/25/1132703381229.html |title=Lloyd Rule to speed up goalkicking |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Lloyd adjusted his ritual to fit into the new rule, and he still retained the most famous aspect (throwing grass) until the end of his career.\n\nLloyd's goal-scoring ability enabled him to top the Essendon goal scoring every year from 1997 to 2009, except for 2006 when he only played three games due to a serious hamstring injury.\n\n[[File:Matthew lloyd.jpg|220px|thumb|Lloyd in the 2007 AFL season]]\n\nLloyd was selected in the [[All-Australian team]] on five occasions (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), won the [[Coleman Medal]] for kicking the most goals in the regular season three times (2000, 2001 and 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |title=Coleman Medal - Previous Winners |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924113126/http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and twice kicked more than 100 goals in a completed season (109 in 2000 and 105 in 2001; on both occasions he reached the milestone during the finals).\n\nLloyd was a member of Essendon's 2000 [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] team and was captain of Essendon from 2006 to 2009.

The Bombers picked up what would be one of their all-time greats for a relative pittance in the draft. Lloyd was heralded as a future football star after his AFL debut in Round 14, 1995, where he scored a goal with his first kick in league football and three for the match.\n\nThe key features of Lloyd's game were his powerful [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]s on the lead (particularly overhead), his use of his body in a defensive capacity and accurate goal kicking, particularly from [[set shot]]s on his left foot. He converted a large majority of set shots inside the [[50-metre arc]] and kicked further than 50 metres on a regular basis.\n\nLloyd was known for his ritual when taking set shots at goal. Almost every time, he took time to go far back on the mark, pull both his socks up, and then grab some grass and throw it into the air to measure the wind and take a very long run-up before kicking. In 2006, the AFL introduced a \"shot clock\" to limit the amount of time that players had to take set shots; although Lloyd's ritual was not the longest in the league, its quirks made it so well known that the rule became commonly known as the \"Lloyd Rule\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/lloyd-rule-to-speed-up-goalkicking/2005/11/25/1132703381229.html |title=Lloyd Rule to speed up goalkicking |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Lloyd adjusted his ritual to fit into the new rule, and he still retained the most famous aspect (throwing grass) until the end of his career.\n\nLloyd's goal-scoring ability enabled him to top the Essendon goal scoring every year from 1997 to 2009, except for 2006 when he only played three games due to a serious hamstring injury.\n\n[[File:Matthew lloyd.jpg|220px|thumb|Lloyd in the 2007 AFL season]]\n\nLloyd was selected in the [[All-Australian team]] on five occasions (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), won the [[Coleman Medal]] for kicking the most goals in the regular season three times (2000, 2001 and 2003)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |title=Coleman Medal - Previous Winners |publisher=Afl.com.au |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924113126/http://www.afl.com.au/aflhq/awards/colemanmedal/previouswinners/tabid/15089/default.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and twice kicked more than 100 goals in a completed season (109 in 2000 and 105 in 2001; on both occasions he reached the milestone during the finals).\n\nLloyd was a member of Essendon's 2000 [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] team and was captain of Essendon from 2006 to 2009.
