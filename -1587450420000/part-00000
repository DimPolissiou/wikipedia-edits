[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]]. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, what is now called [[Torres Strait]] and associated islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain. He returned to [[London]] with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in [[Sydney,  New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right\u2014the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"<ref>Charles Griffiths cited in Richard Broome (1999) p. 35</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s, Australian writers began to re-assess European assumptions about Aboriginal Australia\u2014with works including [[Alan Moorehead]]'s ''The Fatal Impact'' (1966) and [[Geoffrey Blainey]]'s landmark history ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975).

Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory. ''An Historical Narrative of the Discovery of New Holland and New South Wales'', published in November 1786, contained \"A General Chart of New Holland, including New South Wales & Botany Bay, with The Adjacent Countries, and New Discovered Islands\", which showed all the territory claimed under the jurisdiction of the Governor of New South Wales.<ref>Robert J.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. In 1802, Flinders successfully circumnavigated Australia for the first time.\n\n[[Van Diemen's Land]], now known as [[Tasmania]], was settled in 1803, following a failed attempt to settle at [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]] in what is now Victoria. Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26\u00b0 South by the British Parliament because that was considered to be the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of [[Gulf St Vincent]]; the [[South Australian Company]] had proposed the parallel of 20\u00b0 South, later reduced to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (the parallel of latitude 23\u00b0 37\u2032 South).<ref>South Australian Association, ''South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia'', London, Ridgway, 1834, p. 6; Henry Capper and William Light, ''South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ...

Following an incident at his home in 1878, police parties searched for him in the bush. After he killed three policemen, the colony proclaimed Kelly and his gang wanted [[outlaw]]s.\n\nA final violent confrontation with police took place at [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]] on 28 June 1880. Kelly, dressed in home-made plate metal [[armour]] and helmet, was captured and sent to jail. He was hanged for murder at [[Old Melbourne Gaol]] in November 1880. His daring and notoriety made him an [[Cultural icon|iconic]] figure in Australian history, folklore, literature, art and film.\n\nSome bushrangers, most notably Ned Kelly in his [[Jerilderie Letter]], and in his final raid on Glenrowan, explicitly represented themselves as political rebels. Attitudes to Kelly, by far the most well-known bushranger, exemplify the ambivalent views of Australians regarding bushranging.\n\n===Development of Australian democracy===\n{{Main|Suffrage in Australia}}\n\nTraditional [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] society had been governed by councils of elders and a corporate decision making process, but the first European-style governments established after 1788 were [[autocratic]] and run by appointed [[Governors of New South Wales|governors]]\u2014although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the [[doctrine of reception]], thus notions of the rights and processes established by the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] were brought from Britain by the colonists.

Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters.

The new Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], and his largely inexperienced government were almost immediately faced with a series of crises. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control over the banking system and divisions within their party over how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. Some gravitated to New South Wales [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Premier Lang]], others to Prime Minister Scullin.\n\nVarious \"plans\" to resolve the crisis were suggested; [[Otto Niemeyer|Sir Otto Niemeyer]], a representative of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]] proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt.<ref>Jan Bassett(1986) pp. 118\u201319</ref> The \"Premier's Plan\" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation.<ref>John Close \"The Depression Decade\" in R. Willis, et al (eds.) (1982), p. 318</ref> In March 1931, Lang announced that interest due in London would not be paid and the Federal government stepped in to meet the debt. In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury. Game judged it was illegal. Lang refused to withdraw his order and, on 13 May, he was [[Lang Dismissal Crisis|dismissed by Governor Game]].

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

(This is not to say that 81.9 per cent of women were working but that 7.9 per cent of the women interested/looking for work were unable to find it, a much lower figure than maybe first thought, as many women stayed home and were not in the job force in those years, especially if they were unable to find work.)\n\nIn the working class suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], 41.3 per cent of men and 20.7 per cent of women were listed as unemployed.<ref>Spearritt cited in Henry Pook (1993) pp. 211\u201312.

At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion over how the defence spending should be allocated. The [[United Australia Party]] government emphasised co-operation with Britain in \"a policy of imperial defence\".

[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]]. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, what is now called [[Torres Strait]] and associated islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain. He returned to [[London]] with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in [[Sydney,  New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island.

Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland.

In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored).

The following year, the [[1891 National Australasian Convention]] was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft Constitutional Bill was produced by the Constitution Committee, chiefly drafted by [[Samuel Griffith]], with Inglis Clark and Charles Kingston, as well as the assistance of [[Edmund Barton]]. The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal.

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

(This is not to say that 81.9 per cent of women were working but that 7.9 per cent of the women interested/looking for work were unable to find it, a much lower figure than maybe first thought, as many women stayed home and were not in the job force in those years, especially if they were unable to find work.)\n\nIn the working class suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], 41.3 per cent of men and 20.7 per cent of women were listed as unemployed.<ref>Spearritt cited in Henry Pook (1993) pp. 211\u201312.

At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion over how the defence spending should be allocated. The [[United Australia Party]] government emphasised co-operation with Britain in \"a policy of imperial defence\".

The movements to end Australia's involvement gathered strength after the [[Tet Offensive]] of early 1968 and compulsory national service (selected by ballot) became increasingly unpopular. In the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 elections]], the government hung on despite a significant decline in popularity.

In November 1970 [[1st Australian Task Force]] was reduced to two battalions and in November 1971, 1ATF was withdrawn from Vietnam.

According to McIntyre, that interpretation has been largely abandoned by recent scholars:\n:The process of settlement is now regarded as a violent invasion of a rich and subtle indigenous culture, the colonists' material practices as destructive of a fragile environment, their aesthetic response to it blinkered and prejudiced, the cultivation of some British forms timid and unresponsive.<ref>McIntyre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2G63IrFXpgC&pg=PA164 online p 164]</ref>\n\nThe first major history of Australia was William Charles Wentworth's ''Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales, and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land: With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration, and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America'' (1819).<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00068.html online]</ref> Wentworth details the disastrous effects the penal regime.

It was inaugurated by the first [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] on 2 October 1955. Later the Furnishing Division was inaugurated on 2 October 1962 and the production of fully furnished coaches steadily increased over the years. The total estimated cost of the factory was {{INR}} 74.7 million. In full production, about 350 broad-guage coaches per annum are produced.<ref>https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55733/1/lsd_01_06_23-03-1954.pdf page 4</ref>\n\n==Manufacturing==\nThe ICF consists of two main divisions, namely, shell division and furnishing division. The shell division manufactures the skeleton of the rail coach, while the furnishing division is concerned with the coach interiors and amenities. An ancillary unit to the ICF is being built in [[Haldia]], [[West Bengal]] for furnishing [[diesel multiple units]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/logistics/article2854285.ece | title=Railways' Haldia factory phase I may be commissioned by Oct/Nov | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=2 February 2012 | accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> ICF manufactures more than 170 varieties of coaches including the [[Kolkata Metro rolling stock|Kolkata Metro]] rakes for BHEL, NGEF, Medha, first and second class coaches, pantry and kitchen cars, luggage and brake vans, self-propelled coaches, [[electric multiple unit|electric]] (EMU), diesel (DMU) and mainline electric multiple unit (MEMU), metro coaches and diesel-electric tower cars, accident relief medical vans (ARMV), inspection cars (RA), fuel test cars, track recording cars and luxury coaches.

The Soviet Union proclaimed itself a socialist state and proclaimed its commitment to building a [[socialist economy]] in its [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1936 constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]]. It was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] remaining its [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|official guiding ideology]] until the [[Soviet Union dissolution|Soviet Union's dissolution]] on 26 December 1991. The political systems of these Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally, the [[communist party]] practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986\"/> During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]. The [[Eastern Bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of [[Soviet satellite states|Soviet-aligned socialist states]] in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Soviet-style [[Soviet Bloc politics|governance]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|command economy]].\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] was founded on 1 October 1949 and proclaims itself to be a socialist state in its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]]. The [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'' which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.<ref name=\"freemediaproductions.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/|title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx \u2013 Not Marxist-Leninism|publisher=Free Media Productions \u2013 Editorials|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Similarly, direct references to [[communism]] in the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] are not included in its [[Constitution of Laos|founding documents]], although it gives direct power to the governing ruling party, the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. The preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|constitution]] of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was [[Vietnamese reunification|re-unified]] under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1976.<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy \u2013 Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 constitution]] of the [[Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"].

In most cases, these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]]. The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening \"the way to socialist society\".<ref>The [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html \"Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal\"] stated: \"The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society.\"</ref> [[Algeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have directly used the term socialist in their official constitution and name.

In the case of many Middle Eastern states, the term socialism was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath parties]]. Examples of countries directly using the term socialist in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include India<ref>The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads: \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic [...]\". See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].</ref> and [[Portugal]]. In addition, countries like [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] use the varied term social state, leaving a more ambiguous meaning. In the constitutions of Croatia, Hungary and Poland, direct condemnation is made to the respective past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]] which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]] has been described as a socialist state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Derek|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis|newspaper=Morning Star|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{social democracy sidebar}}\nDuring the [[post-war consensus]], [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread and it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].<ref name=\"Dissident 1991\">Heilbroner, Robert L.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat would represent this transitional state and would involve working class interests dominating government policy in the same manner that capitalist class interests dominate government policy under capitalism (the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie). Engels argued that as socialism developed, the state would change in form and function. Under socialism, it is not a \"government of people, but the administration of things\", thereby ceasing to be a state by the traditional definition.<ref>\"Withering away of the state\".

In order not to be overthrown once having conquered power, Engels argues that the working class \"must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressive machinery previously used against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without exception, subject to recall at any moment\".

Bernstein stated: \"The socialist movement is everything to me while what people commonly call the goal of Socialism is nothing\".<ref>[[Manfred Steger|Steger, Manfred]] (1996). ''Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920\u20131921''. New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917). ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. p. 70. cf. \"Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state\".</ref> as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment.

He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

The Soviet Union proclaimed itself a socialist state and proclaimed its commitment to building a [[socialist economy]] in its [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1936 constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]]. It was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] remaining its [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|official guiding ideology]] until the [[Soviet Union dissolution|Soviet Union's dissolution]] on 26 December 1991. The political systems of these Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally, the [[communist party]] practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986\"/> During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]. The [[Eastern Bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of [[Soviet satellite states|Soviet-aligned socialist states]] in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Soviet-style [[Soviet Bloc politics|governance]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|command economy]].\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] was founded on 1 October 1949 and proclaims itself to be a socialist state in its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]]. The [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'' which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.<ref name=\"freemediaproductions.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/|title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx \u2013 Not Marxist-Leninism|publisher=Free Media Productions \u2013 Editorials|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Similarly, direct references to [[communism]] in the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] are not included in its [[Constitution of Laos|founding documents]], although it gives direct power to the governing ruling party, the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. The preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|constitution]] of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was [[Vietnamese reunification|re-unified]] under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1976.<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy \u2013 Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 constitution]] of the [[Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"].

In most cases, these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]]. The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening \"the way to socialist society\".<ref>The [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html \"Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal\"] stated: \"The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society.\"</ref> [[Algeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have directly used the term socialist in their official constitution and name.

In the case of many Middle Eastern states, the term socialism was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath parties]]. Examples of countries directly using the term socialist in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include India<ref>The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads: \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic [...]\". See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].</ref> and [[Portugal]]. In addition, countries like [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] use the varied term social state, leaving a more ambiguous meaning. In the constitutions of Croatia, Hungary and Poland, direct condemnation is made to the respective past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]] which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]] has been described as a socialist state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Derek|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis|newspaper=Morning Star|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{social democracy sidebar}}\nDuring the [[post-war consensus]], [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread and it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].<ref name=\"Dissident 1991\">Heilbroner, Robert L.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat would represent this transitional state and would involve working class interests dominating government policy in the same manner that capitalist class interests dominate government policy under capitalism (the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie). Engels argued that as socialism developed, the state would change in form and function.

''Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920\u20131921''. New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917). ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. p. 70. cf. \"Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state\".</ref> as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 371. {{ISBN|9780199585977}}.</ref> In this way, Lenin was thereby proposing a classically dynamic view of progressive social structure which during his own short period of governance emerged as a defensive and preliminary bureaucratic centralist stage. He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

They reason that a socialist state is antithetical to socialism and that socialism will emerge spontaneously from the [[grassroots]] level in an [[Evolutionary economics|evolutionary manner]], developing its own unique political and economic institutions for a highly organized [[stateless society]]. Libertarian communists, including [[Anarcho-communism|anarchists]], [[Council communism|councillists]], [[Left communism|leftists]] and [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxists]], also reject the concept of a socialist state for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism and communism can only be established through [[revolution]] and dissolving the existence of the state.

''The Oxford History of Mexico'' (2000) p. 322</ref>  His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing half its territory, beginning with the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836 and culminating with the [[Mexican Cession]] of 1848 following its loss to the United States in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. But his leadership in the Mexican-American War and his willingness to fight to the bitter end prolonged the war. \"More than any other single person it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of a short war.\"<ref>Guardino, Peter.

He was overthrown by the liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]] in 1855 and lived most of his later years in exile.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAntonio de Padua Mar\u00eda Severino L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna y P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n was born in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], [[New Spain|Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain), on 21 February 1794. He was from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Manuela P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n, belonged to the elite ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' racial group of American-born Spaniards. His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing.

G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas was a moderate, but he had a radical liberal congress with which to contend, perhaps a reason that Santa Anna left executive power to his vice president.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 143.</ref>  The nation was faced with an empty treasury and the 11&nbsp;million peso debt incurred by the Bustamante government. He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed. All this caused concern among Mexican conservatives.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 980380|title = Santa Anna and the G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas Administration in Mexico, 1833-1834|journal = The Americas|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 18\u201350|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1974|doi = 10.2307/980380}}</ref> G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas also sought to extend these reforms to the frontier province of [[Alta California]], promoting legislation to [[Spanish missions in California#secularization|secularize]] the [[Franciscan]] missions there.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget. On Santa Anna's suggestion, the number of battalions was to be reduced as well as the number of generals and brigadiers.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 145.</ref>\n\nA law was issued, the ''Ley del Caso'' that called for the arrest of 51 politicians, including former president Bustamante for holding \"unpatriotic\" beliefs and ordered them expelled from the republic.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress.\n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30\u201340,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released. The treaty was a major turning point in Santa Anna's career, as it meant the end of Mexican sovereignty in Texas.<ref>animatedatlas.com/mexwar/santaanna.html\" 'Treaty' Between Santa Anna and Texas\"</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSanta Anna rode double into Sam Houston's camp on the horse of [[Joel Walter Robison]], a soldier in most of the battles and later a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Fayette County, Texas|Fayette County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fro42\n|title=Robison, Joel Walter|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing Texas president [[David G. Burnet]] and Santa Anna signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], the latter under duress, stating that \"in his official character as chief of the Mexican nation, he acknowledged the full, entire, and perfect Independence of the Republic of Texas.\" In exchange, Burnet and the Texas government guaranteed Santa Anna's safety and transport to Veracruz. During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty. They do not know what it is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of Catholic clergy, a despotism is a proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |title=Captivity of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna |accessdate=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Tfvw5bs?url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Redemption, dictatorship, and exile===\n[[File: \u00c9pisode de l'exp\u00e9dition du Mexique en 1838.jpg|thumb|French bombardment of the fort of San Juan de Ul\u00faa in the [[Pastry War]]]]\n\nAfter some time in exile in the U.S., and after meeting U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico. He was transported aboard the [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']] to retire to his [[hacienda]] in [[Veracruz]], called [[Manga de Clavo]].\n\nIn 1837, Santa Anna also wrote a manifesto in which he reflected on his Texas experiences as well as his surrender. His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842.

Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844.

Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end.

Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853. Santa Anna honored his promises to the Church, revoking a decree denying protection for the fulfillment of monastic vows, a reform promulgated twenty years earlier during the era of [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. President Santa Anna had left running the government in 1833 to his liberal vice president.<ref name=mecham-358-59>Mecham, ''Church and State'', pp. 358\u2013359.</ref> The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had been expelled from Spanish realms by the crown in 1767, were allowed to return to Mexico ostensibly to educate poorer classes, and much of their property, which the crown had confiscated and sold, was restored to them.<ref name=mecham-358-59/>\n\nAlthough he gave himself exalted titles, Santa Anna's situation was quite vulnerable. He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" His full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsden thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>\n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba. As the extent of his corruption became known, he was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for treason; all his estates were confiscated by the government.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Juan Cordero - Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|'' Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna'' by [[Juan Cordero]], 1855.

At neither wedding ceremony did he appear, legally empowering his future father-in-law to serve as a proxy at his first wedding and a friend at his second.<ref>Fowler, Will. \"All the President's Women: The Wives of General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna in 19th century Mexico\", ''Feminist Review'', No. 79, Latin America: History, war, and independence (2005), pp. 57\u201358.</ref> One assessment of the two marriages is that they were arranged marriages of convenience, bringing considerable wealth to Santa Anna and that his lack of attendance at the wedding ceremonies \"appears to confirm that he was purely interested in the financial aspect on the alliance.\"<ref name=fowler58>Fowler, \"All the President's Women\", p. 58.</ref>\n\n[[File: Johhan Moritz Rugendas, Manga de Clavo.

When Iturbide as Mexican emperor lost support, Santa Anna had been in the forefront of leaders seeking to oust him. Although Santa Anna's family was of modest means, he was of good creole lineage; the Garc\u00eda family may well have seen a match between their young daughter and the up-and-coming Santa Anna as advantageous. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s's dowry allowed Santa Anna to purchase the first of his haciendas, Manga de Clavo, in Veracruz state.<ref name=fowler58/><ref>Potash, Robert. \"Testaments de Santa Anna.\" ''Historia Mexicana'', Vol. 13, No. 3, 430\u2013440.</ref>\n\nThe wife of the first Spanish Ambassador to Mexico, [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Fanny Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and her husband visited with Santa Anna's first wife In\u00e9s at Manga de Clavo, where they were well-received with a breakfast banquet.  Mme. Calder\u00f3n de la Barca observed that \"After breakfast, the Se\u00f1ora having dispatched an officer for her cigar-case, which was gold with a diamond latch, offered me a cigar, which I having declined, she lighted her own, a little paper 'cigarette', and the gentlemen followed her good example.\"<ref>Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, F. ''Life in Mexico''. London: Century, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nTwo months after the death of his wife In\u00e9s Garc\u00eda in 1844, the 50-year-old Santa Anna married 16-year-old Mar\u00eda de Los Dolores de Tosta. The couple rarely lived together; de Tosta resided primarily in Mexico City and Santa Anna's political and military activities took him around the country.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}} They had no children, leading biographer Will Fowler to speculate that the marriage was either primarily platonic or that de Tosta was infertile.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}}\n\nSeveral women claimed to have borne Santa Anna [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] children. In his will, Santa Anna acknowledged and made provisions for four: Paula, Mar\u00eda de la Merced, Petra, and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. Biographers have identified three more: Pedro L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, and \u00c1ngel and Augustina Rosa L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=92}}\n\n==Later years and death==\n[[File:Tumbasantaanna.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and his second wife, Sra. Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna]]\n\nFrom 1855 to 1874, Santa Anna lived in exile in Cuba, the United States, Colombia, and the then Danish island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]].  He had left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848 and traveled to and from Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires. He attempted but was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that this substance could be more useful in tires than the materials they were originally using. Although he introduced chewing gum to the United States, he did not make any money from the product.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1865, he attempted to return and offer his services during the French invasion by posing once again as the country's defender and savior, only to be refused by Ju\u00e1rez who was well aware of Santa Anna's character. Later that year a schooner owned by Gilbert Thompson, son-in-law of [[Daniel Tompkins]], brought Santa Anna to his home in [[Staten Island, New York]],<ref>[https://nypost.com/2011/11/13/mex-generals-staten-ex-isle/ Mex general\u2019s Staten ex-isle] Retrieved 22 November 2018</ref> where he tried to raise money for an army to return and take over Mexico City.\n\n[[File: Casa de Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.JPG|thumb|The house in [[Mexico City]] where Santa Anna spent the last years of his life and wrote most of his memoirs.]]\n\n[[Thomas Adams (chewing gum maker)|Thomas Adams]], the American assigned to aid Santa Anna while he was in the U.S., experimented with chicle in an attempt to use it as a substitute for rubber. He bought one ton of the substance from Santa Anna, but his experiments proved unsuccessful. Instead, Adams helped to found the chewing gum industry with a product that he called \"[[chiclets]].\"<ref name=\"Staten\">[http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 Staten Island on the Web: Famous Staten Islanders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727084919/http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 |date=27 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his many years in exile, Santa Anna was a passionate fan of the sport of [[cockfighting]]. He had many roosters that he entered into competitions, and would have his roosters compete with cocks from all over the world.<ref name=\":0\" /> He would invite breeders from all over the world for matches and is known to have spent tens of thousands of dollars on prize [[rooster]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nIn 1874, he took advantage of a general amnesty and returned to Mexico. Crippled and almost blind from [[cataracts]], he was ignored by the Mexican government that same year at the anniversary of the [[Battle of Churubusco]]. Having retreated from politics in 1855, he remained disconnected until his death in 1876.<ref name=\":0\" /> Santa Anna died at his home in Mexico City on 21 June 1876 at age 82. He was buried with full military honors in a glass coffin in Pante\u00f3n del Tepeyac Cemetery.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mexico}}\n* [[History of democracy in Mexico]]\n* [[List of heads of state of Mexico]]\n\n==Note==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|title=On Art, Artists, Latin America, and Other Utopias |last=Camnitzer |first=Luis |editor-last=Weiss |editor-first=Rachel |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780292783492 |page=199 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsotPY30RfkC&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199&dq}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|title=Tornel and Santa Anna: the writer and the caudillo, Mexico, 1795\u20131853\n |last=Fowler |first=Will|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group\n |year=2000|isbn=978-0-313-30914-4|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftOV3nd78KQC&pg=PA20}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv\n |last=Fowler|first=Will|title=Santa Anna of Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFszaXaypkoC|accessdate=17 August 2012\n |date=1 November 2009|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-2638-8}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |language=Spanish\n |last=Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero |first=Enrique\n |authorlink=Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero\n |title=Pa\u00eds de un solo hombre: el M\u00e9xico de Santa Anna.

He was from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Manuela P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n, belonged to the elite ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' racial group of American-born Spaniards. His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing. According to Mexican historian [[Enrique Krauze]], \"It annoyed him and bored him, and perhaps frightened him.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 137.</ref> A biographer of Santa Anna described him in this period as the \"absentee president.\"<ref>Fowler, Will.

Santa Anna retired to his Veracruz hacienda, [[Manga de Clavo]]. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas was a moderate, but he had a radical liberal congress with which to contend, perhaps a reason that Santa Anna left executive power to his vice president.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 143.</ref>  The nation was faced with an empty treasury and the 11&nbsp;million peso debt incurred by the Bustamante government. He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed. All this caused concern among Mexican conservatives.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 980380|title = Santa Anna and the G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas Administration in Mexico, 1833-1834|journal = The Americas|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 18\u201350|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1974|doi = 10.2307/980380}}</ref> G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas also sought to extend these reforms to the frontier province of [[Alta California]], promoting legislation to [[Spanish missions in California#secularization|secularize]] the [[Franciscan]] missions there.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget. On Santa Anna's suggestion, the number of battalions was to be reduced as well as the number of generals and brigadiers.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 145.</ref>\n\nA law was issued, the ''Ley del Caso'' that called for the arrest of 51 politicians, including former president Bustamante for holding \"unpatriotic\" beliefs and ordered them expelled from the republic. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas claimed that Santa Anna was the driving force for the law, which evidence seems to support.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 420</ref> With increasing resistance from the church as well as the army, the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]] was issued, likely orchestrated by former general and governor of the [[Federal District]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Tornel]]. The plan called for repeal the ''Ley del Caso'' and urged lack of tolerance for the influence of [[Masonic lodges]], where politics was pursued in secrecy; declared void the laws passed by Congress and the local legislatures in favor of the reforms; requested the protection of President Santa Anna to fulfill the plan, and recognize him as the only authority; removal from office the deputies and officials who carried out enforcement of the reform laws and decrees; and provide military force to support the president in implementing the plan.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |language=Spanish |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wq5LbA_fwugC&pg=PA379\n |last=Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero |first=Enrique\n |authorlink=Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero\n |title=Pa\u00eds de un solo hombre: el M\u00e9xico de Santa Anna.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress.\n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30\u201340,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released. The treaty was a major turning point in Santa Anna's career, as it meant the end of Mexican sovereignty in Texas.<ref>animatedatlas.com/mexwar/santaanna.html\" 'Treaty' Between Santa Anna and Texas\"</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSanta Anna rode double into Sam Houston's camp on the horse of [[Joel Walter Robison]], a soldier in most of the battles and later a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Fayette County, Texas|Fayette County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fro42\n|title=Robison, Joel Walter|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing Texas president [[David G. Burnet]] and Santa Anna signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], the latter under duress, stating that \"in his official character as chief of the Mexican nation, he acknowledged the full, entire, and perfect Independence of the Republic of Texas.\" In exchange, Burnet and the Texas government guaranteed Santa Anna's safety and transport to Veracruz. During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty. They do not know what it is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of Catholic clergy, a despotism is a proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |title=Captivity of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna |accessdate=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Tfvw5bs?url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Redemption, dictatorship, and exile===\n[[File: \u00c9pisode de l'exp\u00e9dition du Mexique en 1838.jpg|thumb|French bombardment of the fort of San Juan de Ul\u00faa in the [[Pastry War]]]]\n\nAfter some time in exile in the U.S., and after meeting U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico. He was transported aboard the [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']] to retire to his [[hacienda]] in [[Veracruz]], called [[Manga de Clavo]].\n\nIn 1837, Santa Anna also wrote a manifesto in which he reflected on his Texas experiences as well as his surrender. His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842. The new Congress was composed of men of principles who vigorously opposed the autocratic leader.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3338755|title = Generals versus Politicians: Santa Anna and the 1842 Congressional Elections in Mexico|journal = Bulletin of Latin American Research|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 257\u2013274|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1989|doi = 10.2307/3338755}}</ref>\n\nTrying to restore the treasury, Santa Anna raised taxes, but this aroused resistance. Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844. The buried leg he left behind in the capital was dug up by a mob and dragged through the streets until nothing was left of it.{{sfn|Camnitzer|2009}}{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=239}} Fearing for his life, he tried to elude capture, but in January 1845 he was apprehended by a group of Native Americans near [[Xico, Veracruz]]. They turned him over to authorities, and Santa Anna was imprisoned. His life was spared, but he was exiled to [[Cuba]], still a Spanish colony.\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War, 1846\u20131848                                                           ===\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1870.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna circa 1870.]]\n[[File:Nebel Mexican War 07 Battle of Churubusco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Churubusco]], during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], 20 August 1847]]\n\nIn 1846, Mexican and American troops moved towards the Rio Grande into the disputed [[Nueces Strip]]. Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end.

Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853. Santa Anna honored his promises to the Church, revoking a decree denying protection for the fulfillment of monastic vows, a reform promulgated twenty years earlier during the era of [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. President Santa Anna had left running the government in 1833 to his liberal vice president.<ref name=mecham-358-59>Mecham, ''Church and State'', pp. 358\u2013359.</ref> The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], who had been expelled from Spanish realms by the crown in 1767, were allowed to return to Mexico ostensibly to educate poorer classes, and much of their property, which the crown had confiscated and sold, was restored to them.<ref name=mecham-358-59/>\n\nAlthough he gave himself exalted titles, Santa Anna's situation was quite vulnerable. He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" His full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsden thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>\n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba. As the extent of his corruption became known, he was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for treason; all his estates were confiscated by the government.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Juan Cordero - Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|'' Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna'' by [[Juan Cordero]], 1855.

When Iturbide as Mexican emperor lost support, Santa Anna had been in the forefront of leaders seeking to oust him. Although Santa Anna's family was of modest means, he was of good creole lineage; the Garc\u00eda family may well have seen a match between their young daughter and the up-and-coming Santa Anna as advantageous.

He had left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848 and traveled to and from Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires. He attempted but was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that this substance could be more useful in tires than the materials they were originally using. Although he introduced chewing gum to the United States, he did not make any money from the product.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1865, he attempted to return and offer his services during the French invasion by posing once again as the country's defender and savior, only to be refused by Ju\u00e1rez who was well aware of Santa Anna's character.

An important leader of the [[Texas Revolution]], Houston served as the first and third [[President of the Republic of Texas|president]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], and was one of the first two individuals to represent [[Texas]] in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth [[governor of Tennessee]] and the seventh [[governor of Texas]], the only American to be elected governor of two different states in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], Houston and his family migrated to [[Maryville, Tennessee]] when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the [[Cherokee]], becoming known as Raven. He served under General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]], and after the war, he presided over the [[Indian removal|removal of many Cherokee from Tennessee]]. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827, Houston was elected as the [[governor of Tennessee]]. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and joined his Cherokee friends in [[Arkansas Territory]].\n\nHouston settled in [[Texas]] in 1832. After the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the [[Texian Army]]. He led the Texian Army to victory at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won election in the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]]. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won election to another term in the [[1841 Republic of Texas presidential election|1841 Texas presidential election]]. Houston played a key role in the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States in 1845, and in 1846, he was elected to represent Texas in the [[United States Senate]]. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and supported President [[James K. Polk]]'s prosecution of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nHouston's senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican\u2013American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] and the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. In 1859, Houston won election as the [[governor of Texas]]. In this role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the [[Confederate States of America]]. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of [[Houston]], the fourth most populous city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Houstonbirthplacemarker.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sam Houston Birthplace Marker in Rockbridge County, Virginia]]\n\nHouston was         born in Rockbridge County, Virginia on March 2, 1793 to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from Scottish and Irish immigrants who had settled in [[British North America]] in the 1730s.<ref name=\"williams1318\" /> Houston's father was descended from [[Ulster Scots people]]; he could trace his ancestry to [[Sir Hugh de Paduinan]], a [[Normans|Norman]] knight.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 5</ref> By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.\n\nHouston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the \"lost\" [[State of Franklin]] then in the western frontier of [[North Carolina]], who advocated for the passage of his proposed \"A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland\" at the convention that was assembled in Greeneville, Tennessee on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.<ref>\"Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey Autobiography and Letters,\" p. 317. Edited by Willaim B. Hesseltine. The University of Tennessee Press.</ref>\n\nHouston had five brothers and three sisters as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life.<ref name=\"williams1318\">Williams (1994), pp. 13\u201318</ref> Houston did take an interest in his father's library, reading works by [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors like [[Virgil]] as well as more recent works by authors such as [[Jedidiah Morse]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nHouston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 6</ref> He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of [[Blount County, Tennessee]]. At this time, Tennessee was on the [[American frontier]], and even larger towns like Nashville, Tennessee were vigilant against Native American raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of 16, he left his family to live with a [[Cherokee]] tribe led by [[Ahuludegi]] (also spelled Oolooteka).<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as Raven.<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 25\u201326</ref> He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 10</ref>\n\n==War of 1812 and aftermath==\nIn 1812, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which then was engaged in the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the [[39th Infantry Regiment (War of 1812)|39th Infantry Regiment]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of the third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded by General [[Andrew Jackson]], who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the [[Muscogee]] (or \"Creek\") tribe in the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 11\u201314</ref> Houston was wounded badly in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], the decisive battle in the [[Creek War]]. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman [[John Rhea]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the [[Indian removal|removal]] of Cherokee from East Tennessee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 19\u201320</ref> In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun's death in 1850.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 24\u201325</ref> Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in [[Arkansas Territory]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 26\u201329</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor [[Joseph McMinn]], Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 31\u201333</ref> Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the [[1820 United States Census]], and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 34\u201335</ref> In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]], which was won by [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and those who favored Adams became known as [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 45\u201346</ref> Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on public domain. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\nIn January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart possibly because Eliza loved another man.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 49\u201357</ref> In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\n==Political exile and controversy==\nHouston was reunited with Ahuludegi's group of Cherokee in mid-1829.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 64\u201365</ref> Because of Houston's experience in government and his connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 68\u201369</ref> In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 71\u201372</ref> In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston made an unsuccessful bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 73\u201374</ref> When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman [[William Stanbery]] alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 80\u201382</ref> After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House [[Andrew Stevenson]] formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages. \n\nHouston was a slaveholder.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 82\u201386</ref>\n\n==Texas Revolution==\n[[File:General Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|General Sam Houston (postcard, circa 1905)]]\n\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends, [[William H. Wharton]] and [[John Austin Wharton (1806\u201338)|John Austin Wharton]], wrote to convince him to travel to the Mexican possession of [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], where unrest among the American settlers was growing.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 87\u201388</ref> The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 91\u201392</ref> Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the [[Convention of 1833]], which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 96\u201397</ref> After the convention, Texan leader [[Stephen F. Austin]] petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. In 1834, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In October 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] broke out with the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]], a congregation of Texas leaders.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Texian Army]], though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 113\u2013118</ref> Houston helped organize the [[Convention of 1836]], where the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from [[William B. Travis]], who commanded Texan forces [[Siege of the Alamo|under siege]] by Santa Anna at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston's ranks.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 121\u2013124</ref> Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 125\u2013128</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width     =\n| image1    = Sam Houston at San Jacinto.jpg\n| width1    = 200 \n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Detail from ''Houston at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]'' by Henry Arthur McArdle\n| image2    = SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg\n| width2    = 285\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Surrender of Santa Anna'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican general [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston.

On the April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].

Burnet]] resigned.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States. Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country's finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico. He selected [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] as secretary of war, Smith as secretary of the treasury, [[Samuel Rhoads Fisher]] as secretary of the navy, [[James Collinsworth]] as attorney general, and Austin as secretary of state.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 166\u2013169</ref>{{efn|After Austin died of an illness in December 1836, Houston ordered a month of mourning.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>}} Houston sought normalized relations with Mexico, and despite some resistance from the legislature, arranged the release of Santa Anna.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 171\u2013172</ref> Concerned about upsetting the balance between [[slave states and free states]], U.S. President Andrew Jackson refused to push for the annexation of Texas, but in his last official act in office he granted Texas diplomatic recognition.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 175, 190</ref> With the United States unwilling to annex Texas, Houston began courting British support; as part of this effort, he urged the end of the importation of slaves into Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\n[[File:SHouston 2.jpg|thumb|Sam Houston]]\n\nIn early 1837, the government moved to a new capital, the city of Houston, named for the country's first president.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 186</ref> In 1838, Houston frequently clashed with Congress over issues such as a treaty with the Cherokee and a land-office act.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 201\u2013202</ref> The Texas constitution barred presidents from seeking a second term, so Houston did not stand for re-election in the [[1838 Republic of Texas presidential election|1838 election]] and left office in late 1838.

In the [[Oregon Treaty]], reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 297</ref> Meanwhile, Polk ordered General [[Zachary Taylor]] to lead a U.S. army to the [[Rio Grande]], which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the Nueces River constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 297\u2013298</ref> After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], acquired the [[Mexican Cession]]. Mexico also agreed to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and Texas.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAfter the war, disputes over the extension of slavery into the [[United States territory|territories]] raised sectional tensions. Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the [[Oregon Bill of 1848]], which organized [[Oregon Territory]] as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\"<ref>Haley (2002), p. 301</ref> He criticized both Northern [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 302\u2013304</ref> He supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|fugitive slave law]] was passed, and [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, Texas, and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 304\u2013308</ref> Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state. The [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] ultimately nominated [[Franklin Pierce]], a compromise nominee, who went on to win the election.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 311\u2013313</ref>\n\n===Pierce and Buchanan administrations (1853\u20131859)===\n{{see also|Presidency of Franklin Pierce|Presidency of James Buchanan}}\n[[File:Sam Houston c1856-59-crop.png|thumb|Houston in 1859]]\n\nIn 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] led the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which organized [[Kansas Territory]] and [[Nebraska Territory]]. The act also repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]], an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 321\u2013326</ref> Houston's opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party.<ref>Cantrell (1993), p. 333</ref> In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and unionist [[Know Nothing]] movement.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had both emerged as major political movements.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 340\u2013341</ref> Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the [[naturalization]] period for immigrants to 21 years.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 330\u2013333</ref> He was attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state as well the party's unionist stance.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 341\u2013342</ref>\n\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the [[1856 American National Convention|Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention]], but the party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]]. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]]. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his tenure in the senate.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 340\u2013342</ref> In the [[1857 Texas gubernatorial election]], Texas Democrats nominated [[Hardin Richard Runnels]], who supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and attacked Houston's record. In response, Houston announced his own candidacy for governor, but Runnels defeated him by a decisive margin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 344, 352</ref> After the gubernatorial election, the Texas legislature denied Houston re-election in the senate; Houston rejected calls to resign immediately and served until the end of his term in early 1859.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 353, 360</ref>\n\n==Governor of Texas==\n{{see also|Texas in the American Civil War}}\n[[File:Sam Houston by Mathew Brady.jpg|thumb|Sam Houston in 1861.]]\n\nHouston ran against Runnels in the [[1859 Texas gubernatorial election|1859 gubernatorial election]]. Capitalizing on Runnels's unpopularity over state issues such as Native American raids, Houston won the election and took office in December 1859.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 362\u2013365</ref> In the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Houston and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] were the two major contenders for the presidential nomination of the newly-formed [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which consisted largely of Southern unionists. Houston narrowly trailed Bell on the first ballot of the [[1860 Constitutional Union Convention]], but Bell clinched the nomination on the second ballot.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 371\u2013372</ref> Nonetheless, some of Houston's Texan supporters nominated him for president in April 1860. Other backers attempted to launch a nationwide campaign, but in August 1860, Houston announced that he would not be a candidate for president. He refused to endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 372\u2013374</ref> In late 1860, Houston campaigned across his home state, calling on Texans to resist those who advocated for secession if Republican nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the 1860 election.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 380\u2013382</ref>\n\nAfter Lincoln won the November 1860 presidential election, several Southern states seceded from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 383\u2013384</ref> A Texas political convention voted to secede from the United States on February 1, 1861, and Houston proclaimed that Texas was once again an independent republic, but he refused to recognize that same convention's authority to join Texas to the Confederacy. After Houston refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy, the legislature declared the governorship vacant. Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but he did not attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal. His successor, [[Edward Clark (governor)|Edward Clark]], was sworn in on March 18.<ref>Westwood (1984), pp. 128\u2013129, 133\u2013134</ref> In an undelivered speech, Houston wrote:\n\n{{quote|Fellow-Citizens, in the name of your rights and liberties, which I believe have been trampled upon, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of the nationality of Texas, which has been betrayed by the Convention, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of the Constitution of Texas, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of my own conscience and manhood, which this Convention would degrade by dragging me before it, to pander to the malice of my enemies, I refuse to take this oath.  I deny the power of this Convention to speak for Texas. ... I protest. ... against all the acts and doings of this convention and I declare them null and void.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 390\u2013391.</ref>}}\n\nOn April 19, 1861, he told a crowd:\n\n{{quote|Let me tell you what is coming.  After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it.  I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 397</ref>}}\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Sam Houston Grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Houston's grave in Huntsville, Texas]]\n\nAfter leaving office, Houston returned to his home in Galveston.<ref>Westwood (1984), p. 129</ref> He later settled in Huntsville, Texas, where he lived in a structure known as the [[Steamboat House (Huntsville, Texas)|Steamboat House]]. In the midst of the Civil War, Houston was shunned by many Texas leaders, though he continued to correspond with Confederate officer [[Ashbel Smith]] and Texas governor [[Francis Lubbock]]. His son, Sam Houston, Jr., served in the Confederate army during the Civil War, but returned home after being wounded at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 399\u2013405</ref> Houston's health suffered a precipitous decline in April 1863, and he died on July 26, 1863, at 70 years of age .<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 412\u2013415</ref>\n\nThe inscription on Houston's tomb reads:\n<poem>\nA Brave Soldier. A Fearless Statesman.\nA Great Orator\u2014A Pure Patriot.\nA Faithful Friend, A Loyal Citizen.\nA Devoted Husband and Father.\nA Consistent Christian\u2014An Honest Man.\n</poem>\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Margaret Lea Houston 1839.jpg|right|thumb|[[Margaret Lea Houston]]]]\n\nIn January 1829 Sam Houston, then Governor of Tennessee, married 19-year-old Eliza Allen. The marriage lasted 11 weeks. Neither Houston nor Eliza ever gave a reason for their separation, but Eliza refused to sanction divorce. Subsequently, he resigned his governorship and went to live with his Cherokee family. In the summer of 1830, Houston married Tiana Rogers (sometimes called Diana), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740\u20131833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764\u20131806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Tiana's second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Tiana later remarried. She died in 1838 of pneumonia.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 70</ref> [[Will Rogers]] was her nephew, three generations removed.<ref>Marquis (1930), pp. 150-152.</ref>\n\nIn 1837, after becoming President of the Republic of Texas, he was able to acquire, from a district court judge, a divorce from Eliza Allen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Houston and Eliza Allen: \u201cTen Thousand Imputed Slanders\u201d |url=https://www.tennesseehistory.org/sam-houston-eliza-allen-ten-thousand-imputed-slanders/ |publisher=The Tennessee Historical Society |accessdate=December 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1839, he purchased a horse which became one of the foundation sires of the [[American Quarter Horse]] breed named [[Copperbottom]]. He owned the horse until its death in 1860.<ref name=\"History\">[https://www.aqha.com/history-of-the-quarter-horse History of the American Quarter Horse]</ref><ref name=\"Lost\">[http://horsesonly.com/pednotes/WL/copperb.htm Copperbottom: A Lost Bloodline]</ref><ref name=\"Copperbottom\">[http://quarterhorserecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Copperbottom.pdf Copperbottom]</ref>\n\nOn May 9, 1840, Houston, aged 47, married for a third time. His bride was 21-year-old [[Margaret Lea Houston|Margaret Moffette Lea]] of Marion, Alabama, the daughter of planters. They had eight children. Margaret acted as a tempering influence on her much older husband and convinced him to stop drinking. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840\u20131863) on [[Trinity Bay (Texas)|Trinity Bay]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. The sacrament was held in the living room of the [[Adolphus Sterne House]] in Nacogdoches, Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 104\u2013105</ref> By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the Baptist church. With the assistance of [[George Washington Baines]], she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to Independence, Texas to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. [[Rufus Columbus Burleson|Rufus C. Burleson]] by immersion in Little Rocky Creek, two miles southeast of Independence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Augustin|first=Byron|title=Independence, Texas|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hli03|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=March 9, 2012|author2=Pitts, William L}}</ref><ref>Seale (1992) pp. 167\u2013171</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Statue of Sam Houston -- Huntsville, Texas.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''[[A Tribute to Courage]]'']]\nHouston, the largest city in Texas and the [[Southern United States|American South]], is named for Sam Houston.

An important leader of the [[Texas Revolution]], Houston served as the first and third [[President of the Republic of Texas|president]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], and was one of the first two individuals to represent [[Texas]] in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth [[governor of Tennessee]] and the seventh [[governor of Texas]], the only American to be elected governor of two different states in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], Houston and his family migrated to [[Maryville, Tennessee]] when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the [[Cherokee]], becoming known as Raven. He served under General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]], and after the war, he presided over the [[Indian removal|removal of many Cherokee from Tennessee]]. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827, Houston was elected as the [[governor of Tennessee]]. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and joined his Cherokee friends in [[Arkansas Territory]].\n\nHouston settled in [[Texas]] in 1832. After the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the [[Texian Army]]. He led the Texian Army to victory at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won election in the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]]. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won election to another term in the [[1841 Republic of Texas presidential election|1841 Texas presidential election]]. Houston played a key role in the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States in 1845, and in 1846, he was elected to represent Texas in the [[United States Senate]]. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and supported President [[James K. Polk]]'s prosecution of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nHouston's senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican\u2013American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] and the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. In 1859, Houston won election as the [[governor of Texas]]. In this role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the [[Confederate States of America]]. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of [[Houston]], the fourth most populous city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Houstonbirthplacemarker.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sam Houston Birthplace Marker in Rockbridge County, Virginia]]\n\nHouston was         born in Rockbridge County, Virginia on March 2, 1793 to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from Scottish and Irish immigrants who had settled in [[British North America]] in the 1730s.<ref name=\"williams1318\" /> Houston's father was descended from [[Ulster Scots people]]; he could trace his ancestry to [[Sir Hugh de Paduinan]], a [[Normans|Norman]] knight.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 5</ref> By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.\n\nHouston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the \"lost\" [[State of Franklin]] then in the western frontier of [[North Carolina]], who advocated for the passage of his proposed \"A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland\" at the convention that was assembled in Greeneville, Tennessee on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.<ref>\"Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey Autobiography and Letters,\" p. 317. Edited by Willaim B. Hesseltine. The University of Tennessee Press.</ref>\n\nHouston had five brothers and three sisters as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life.<ref name=\"williams1318\">Williams (1994), pp. 13\u201318</ref> Houston did take an interest in his father's library, reading works by [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors like [[Virgil]] as well as more recent works by authors such as [[Jedidiah Morse]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nHouston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 6</ref> He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of [[Blount County, Tennessee]]. At this time, Tennessee was on the [[American frontier]], and even larger towns like Nashville, Tennessee were vigilant against Native American raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of 16, he left his family to live with a [[Cherokee]] tribe led by [[Ahuludegi]] (also spelled Oolooteka).<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as Raven.<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 25\u201326</ref> He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 10</ref>\n\n==War of 1812 and aftermath==\nIn 1812, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which then was engaged in the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the [[39th Infantry Regiment (War of 1812)|39th Infantry Regiment]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of the third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded by General [[Andrew Jackson]], who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the [[Muscogee]] (or \"Creek\") tribe in the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 11\u201314</ref> Houston was wounded badly in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], the decisive battle in the [[Creek War]]. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman [[John Rhea]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the [[Indian removal|removal]] of Cherokee from East Tennessee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 19\u201320</ref> In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun's death in 1850.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 24\u201325</ref> Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in [[Arkansas Territory]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 26\u201329</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor [[Joseph McMinn]], Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 31\u201333</ref> Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the [[1820 United States Census]], and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 34\u201335</ref> In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]], which was won by [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and those who favored Adams became known as [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 45\u201346</ref> Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on public domain. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\nIn January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart possibly because Eliza loved another man.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 49\u201357</ref> In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\n==Political exile and controversy==\nHouston was reunited with Ahuludegi's group of Cherokee in mid-1829.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 64\u201365</ref> Because of Houston's experience in government and his connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 68\u201369</ref> In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 71\u201372</ref> In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston made an unsuccessful bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 73\u201374</ref> When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman [[William Stanbery]] alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 80\u201382</ref> After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House [[Andrew Stevenson]] formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages. \n\nHouston was a slaveholder.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 82\u201386</ref>\n\n==Texas Revolution==\n[[File:General Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|General Sam Houston (postcard, circa 1905)]]\n\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends, [[William H. Wharton]] and [[John Austin Wharton (1806\u201338)|John Austin Wharton]], wrote to convince him to travel to the Mexican possession of [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], where unrest among the American settlers was growing.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 87\u201388</ref> The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 91\u201392</ref> Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the [[Convention of 1833]], which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 96\u201397</ref> After the convention, Texan leader [[Stephen F. Austin]] petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. In 1834, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In October 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] broke out with the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]], a congregation of Texas leaders.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Texian Army]], though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 113\u2013118</ref> Houston helped organize the [[Convention of 1836]], where the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from [[William B. Travis]], who commanded Texan forces [[Siege of the Alamo|under siege]] by Santa Anna at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston's ranks.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 121\u2013124</ref> Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 125\u2013128</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width     =\n| image1    = Sam Houston at San Jacinto.jpg\n| width1    = 200 \n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Detail from ''Houston at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]'' by Henry Arthur McArdle\n| image2    = SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg\n| width2    = 285\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Surrender of Santa Anna'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican general [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston.

On the April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The Texans quickly routed Santa Anna's force, though Houston's ankle was shattered by a stray bullet.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 147\u2013151</ref>  In the aftermath of the Battle of San Jacinto, a detachment of Texans captured Santa Anna.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 153\u2013154</ref> Santa Anna was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Velasco]], granting Texas its independence. Houston stayed briefly for negotiations, then returned to the United States for treatment of his ankle wound.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==President of Texas==\n[[File:Wpdms republic of texas.svg|thumb|upright=1|The Republic of Texas after the [[Texas Revolution]]]]\n\nVictory in the Battle of San Jacinto made Houston a hero to many Texans, and he won the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]], defeating Stephen F. Austin and former governor [[Henry Smith (Texas governor)|Henry Smith]]. Houston took office on October 22, 1836 after interim president [[David G. Burnet]] resigned.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States. Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country's finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico.

However, Van Buren's opposition to annexation damaged his candidacy, and he was defeated by [[James K.

Polk defeated Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an [[Mandate (politics)|electoral mandate]]. Meanwhile, Houston's term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by Anson Jones, his secretary of state. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk's victory to convince Congress to approve of the [[annexation of Texas]]. Seeking Texas's immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would be required to keep its public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 285\u2013287</ref> A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas became a U.S. state in February 1846.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 293\u2013294</ref>\n\n==U.S. Senator==\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War and aftermath (1846\u20131853)===\n{{see also|Presidency of James K.

In the [[Oregon Treaty]], reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 297</ref> Meanwhile, Polk ordered General [[Zachary Taylor]] to lead a U.S. army to the [[Rio Grande]], which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the Nueces River constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 297\u2013298</ref> After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], acquired the [[Mexican Cession]].

Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the [[Oregon Bill of 1848]], which organized [[Oregon Territory]] as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\"<ref>Haley (2002), p. 301</ref> He criticized both Northern [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 302\u2013304</ref> He supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|fugitive slave law]] was passed, and [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, Texas, and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 304\u2013308</ref> Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state.

Douglas]] led the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which organized [[Kansas Territory]] and [[Nebraska Territory]]. The act also repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]], an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 321\u2013326</ref> Houston's opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party.<ref>Cantrell (1993), p. 333</ref> In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and unionist [[Know Nothing]] movement.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had both emerged as major political movements.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 340\u2013341</ref> Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the [[naturalization]] period for immigrants to 21 years.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 330\u2013333</ref> He was attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state as well the party's unionist stance.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 341\u2013342</ref>\n\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the [[1856 American National Convention|Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention]], but the party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]]. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]]. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his tenure in the senate.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 340\u2013342</ref> In the [[1857 Texas gubernatorial election]], Texas Democrats nominated [[Hardin Richard Runnels]], who supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and attacked Houston's record.

Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but he did not attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal.

The marriage lasted 11 weeks. Neither Houston nor Eliza ever gave a reason for their separation, but Eliza refused to sanction divorce. Subsequently, he resigned his governorship and went to live with his Cherokee family. In the summer of 1830, Houston married Tiana Rogers (sometimes called Diana), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740\u20131833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764\u20131806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Tiana's second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Tiana later remarried. She died in 1838 of pneumonia.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 70</ref> [[Will Rogers]] was her nephew, three generations removed.<ref>Marquis (1930), pp. 150-152.</ref>\n\nIn 1837, after becoming President of the Republic of Texas, he was able to acquire, from a district court judge, a divorce from Eliza Allen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Houston and Eliza Allen: \u201cTen Thousand Imputed Slanders\u201d |url=https://www.tennesseehistory.org/sam-houston-eliza-allen-ten-thousand-imputed-slanders/ |publisher=The Tennessee Historical Society |accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1839, he purchased a horse which became one of the foundation sires of the [[American Quarter Horse]] breed named [[Copperbottom]].

His bride was 21-year-old [[Margaret Lea Houston|Margaret Moffette Lea]] of Marion, Alabama, the daughter of planters. They had eight children. Margaret acted as a tempering influence on her much older husband and convinced him to stop drinking. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840\u20131863) on [[Trinity Bay (Texas)|Trinity Bay]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. The sacrament was held in the living room of the [[Adolphus Sterne House]] in Nacogdoches, Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 104\u2013105</ref> By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the Baptist church. With the assistance of [[George Washington Baines]], she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to Independence, Texas to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. [[Rufus Columbus Burleson|Rufus C.

It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa.

This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}.

The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]].

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, the cave-dwelling Somali blind barb and the Somali [[cavefish]] can be found.\n\n[[File:Commiphora-myrrha-resin-myrrh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Myrrh]], a common resin in the Horn]]\n\nIt is estimated that about 5,000 species of [[vascular plant]]s are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa.

This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}.

The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]].

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, the cave-dwelling Somali blind barb and the Somali [[cavefish]] can be found.\n\n[[File:Commiphora-myrrha-resin-myrrh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Myrrh]], a common resin in the Horn]]\n\nIt is estimated that about 5,000 species of [[vascular plant]]s are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.
