He is mostly noted as a playmaking lynchpin at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] with whom he won six trophies from 1930 to the 1936 season. James featured as a deep-lying creative midfielder who provided a link between defence and attack. He was famed for his high level of footballing intelligence, outstanding ball control and supreme passing. \n\nJames was described by [[Tom Finney]] as \"an inspiration\" and \"pure magic\" with his style of play eventually leading to comparisons with [[Dennis Bergkamp]]. His [[rheumatism]] meant he wore \"baggy\" shorts so as to conceal the long johns he put on for warmth.

Rovers' best league finish whilst James was at the club was fourth in 1924. Rovers also placed ninth within both the 1923 and 1925 seasons. All in all he made close to a hundred League appearances in his three seasons at [[Starks Park]]. James then went on to link up for \u00a33,000 with club [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1925.<ref name=Rovers>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/sport/football/raith-rovers/alex-james-the-legend-1-3190294|title=Alex James - The Legend|website=Fife Today.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Preston North End===\nDuring James' time at the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side, The Lilywhites twice seemed certain for promotion to only finish sixth and fourth respectively. He then fell out with the club firstly over his wages which were at [[the Football League]]'s [[maximum wage|maximum]] of \u00a38 a week, and also due to Preston not always releasing him for international duty with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Altogether James scored 55 goals in 157 appearances with the club.<ref name=Rovers />\n\n===Arsenal===\n\n<!-- [[File:1936finalkickoff.jpg|thumb|right|Alex James (right) and Harry Hooper of Sheffield United at the start of the [[1936 FA Cup Final]]]] -->\nAlex James left Preston for [[Herbert Chapman]]'s [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1929 for \u00a38,750, making his debut against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 31 August 1929 two weeks before his 28th birthday. In order to circumvent the maximum wage rules, Arsenal arranged it so that his employment at the club was supplemented by a \u00a3250-a-year \"sports demonstrator\" job at [[Selfridges]], the London [[department store]]. James had an unremarkable first season at Arsenal partly due to the recovery from injuries he had accrued at Preston. However his first season at Arsenal brought the first of six trophies in seven seasons there. He played in Arsenal's [[1930 FA Cup Final]] win against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] scoring the first in a 2-0 win to give Arsenal their first major trophy.<ref name=Arsenal /><ref name=HallofFame />\n\nOver time he settled into his role and became part of the dominant side of English football in 1930s. Playing so deep as a supporting player, he scored relatively few goals for Arsenal \u2013 only 27 in 261 appearances \u2013 but created many times that number. James' passing and vision supplied the ammunition that [[Joe Hulme]], [[David Jack]], [[Cliff Bastin]], and [[Jack Lambert (footballer, born 1902)|Jack Lambert]] all put into the net.<ref name = \"dh\">[http://qosfc.com/content-legendsView.aspx?playerid=1048 \"Dave Halliday\" profile on www.qosfc.com]</ref> James orchestrated Arsenal to their first ever [[Football League First Division|First Division Championship]] win in [[1930\u201331 in English football|1930\u201331]].<ref name=James />\n\nThe defending champions started the [[1931\u201332 in English football|1931\u201332]] season badly largely through missing goals from injured Jack Lambert. However, as Lambert returned to goalscoring form Arsenal enjoyed a good run to regain ground on leaders Everton. After their FA Cup semi final win they harboured hopes of a league and cup double. They were now only three points behind Everton with a game in hand. However, only two minutes into the next game at [[West Ham United]], James suffered serious ligament damage. He missed the rest of the league season and without their play maker Arsenal won only one more league game. Arsenal finished second to Everton. They also ran up in the [[1932 FA Cup Final]] against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. James had been passed fit before injuring himself in a pre-match [[Photo shoot|photo call]] for the press. Without him, Arsenal lost 2-1, albeit thanks to a highly controversial goal from Newcastle's [[Jack Allen (footballer born 1903)|Jack Allen]].<ref name=Arsenal /><ref name=HallofFame />\n\nHe recovered to help Arsenal to a second title in [[1932-33 in English football|1932-33]]. Arsenal scored a club record 118 goals in the League that season.\n\nAnother spate of injuries marred James' [[1933-34 in English football|1933-34]] season. Arsenal retained their title but scoring far fewer (75) goals in the process. With James recovered they won a fourth championship, and their third in a row in [[1934\u201335 in English football|1934\u201335]] in style. [[Ted Drake]] scored 42 league goals that first season of his there with many of them supplied by James.<ref name=James />\n\nIn [[1935-36 in English football|1935-36]] he won his last trophy, a second FA Cup winners' medal. James captained Arsenal to their [[1936 FA Cup Final|1-0 win]] over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. With age and injuries taking their toll in the last two seasons of his career, Alex James retired from playing in the summer of 1937.<ref name=Arsenal /><ref name=HallofFame />\n\n==International career==\n[[File:Alex James - coach.jpg|thumb|Alex James]]\nDespite his club form, he won just eight caps for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref name = \"sfa\"/> This was partly due to Preston's reluctance to release him for international matches. He made his international debut on 31 October 1925 in a game against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] which Scotland won 3-0. With the legendary \"[[Wembley Wizards]]\" team he scored a brace in their 5-1 thrashing of [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] in 1928. This game was one of six where James and Hughie Gallacher both played with Scotland winning all of such.<ref name=hugh/> All three of James' international goals also came while playing alongside Gallacher.<ref name=hugh/>\n\nJames is miscredited in some areas with having scored in the 7-3 Scotland win again Northern Ireland in 1929. It is the general consensus that Hughie Gallacher scored five goals in the game which is backed by newspaper reports and several statistical books. There was some controversy over Scotland's 6th goal which was Gallacher's 5th in that both he and Alex James went for the ball at the same time but apart from a couple of reports, the majority of newspapers credited Gallacher with the goal as well as the record books. Gallacher himself was insistent that the goal was his, claiming that as he and Alex James (who was a good friend of his) were of a similar build (and of course in 1929 there were no numbers on the jerseys), it was easy for pressmen to make a mistake.<ref name = \"hgqos\"/>\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn the summer of 1939, James went to Poland, invited by the [[Polish Football Association|Polish Football Association (PZPN)]]. He spent six weeks there, working with Polish coach [[J\u00f3zef Ka\u0142u\u017ca]] and members of the national team. He taught them modern tactics and led several training sessions. James also played in one or two friendly games with Warsaw's teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buwcd.buw.uw.edu.pl/e_zbiory/ckcp/p_sportowy/1939/numer048/imagepages/image2.htm|title=A page of Polish Sports daily \"Przeglad Sportowy\" from Thursday, 15 June 1939 describing James' schedule in Poland|language=Polish|website=UW.EDU.PL}}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II he served in the [[Royal Artillery]].
