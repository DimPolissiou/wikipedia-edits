Clarke did not follow in his fathers footsteps instead he learned his printing skills with Hugh Jones of [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]]. In 1845 he left Jones to become an overseer at a small printing establishment in Ruthin owned by Nathan Maddocks and later his widow Mrs Jane Maddocks. Clarke lived and worked in [[Ruthin]] from 1845 until his death in 1875 where his printing shop overlooked the Wynnstay Arms Hotel.

The collection didn't win the competition, but was later included in an 1860 volume named \"Gems of Welsh Melody\" by Owain Alaw. Owain had been the adjudicator of the [[Llangollen Eisteddfod]] competition and gave it the title \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" (Land of my Fathers).

At the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], it had a population of 112,249. The MSA is anchored by significant jobs at Jacksonville State University, the Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center, Stringfellow Hospital, the Anniston Army Depot, and the Department of Homeland Security at McClellan. McClellan has transitioned from being a closed military base, to becoming the home of hundreds of residents, new retail growth such as a Lowe's Home Improvement Store, and now more than 3,000 jobs spread out over more than 20 employers.  [[Anniston, AL|Anniston]] remains strong in health care, legal, financial services and manufacturing. [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]], with Interstate 20 running right through it, has developed a number of retail and restaurant establishments including the Oxford Exchange which is anchored by Target.\n\n[[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]] is an important city in the region due to its student population and education resources at [[Jacksonville State University]]. The other cities surrounding Anniston\u2013Oxford are [[Piedmont, Alabama|Piedmont]], [[Ohatchee, Alabama|Ohatchee]], [[Hobson City, Alabama|Hobson City]], and [[Weaver, Alabama|Weaver]].\n\n== Counties ==\n'''Alabama'''\n* [[Calhoun County, Alabama|Calhoun]]\n\n== Core cities ==\n\n* [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]\n* [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]]\n\n=== Suburbs with more than 5,000 inhabitants ===\n* [[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]]\n* [[Saks, Alabama|Saks]]\n* [[Choccolocco, Alabama|Choccolocco]] \n* [[Piedmont, Alabama|Piedmont]]\n\n=== Suburbs with less than 5,000 inhabitants ===\n\n* [[Alexandria, Alabama|Alexandria]]\n* [[Hobson City, Alabama|Hobson City]]\n* [[Nances Creek, Alabama|Nances Creek]]\n* [[Ohatchee, Alabama|Ohatchee]]\n* [[Weaver, Alabama|Weaver]]\n* [[West End-Cobb Town, Alabama|West End-Cobb Town]]\n* [[White Plains, Calhoun County, Alabama|White Plains]]\n\n==Education==\n\n===K-12 education===\n'''Public'''\n\n*[[Anniston City Schools]]\n*[[Calhoun County Schools]]\n*[[Oxford City Schools]]\n*[[Jacksonville City Schools]]\n*[[Piedmont City Schools]]\n\n'''Private'''\n*[[The Donoho School]]\n*[[Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School, Anniston|Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School]]\n*[[Jacksonville Christian Academy]]\n*[[Trinity Christian Academy (Alabama)|Trinity Christian Academy]]\nFaith Christian School\n\n===Institutions of higher education===\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n**Main Jacksonville Campus\n**McClellan Campus\n*[[Gadsden State Community College]]\n**Ayers Campus\n**McClellan Campus\n*[[Gadsden Business College]]\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Main roadways===\n\n[[Interstate 20]] runs through the southern portion of the county, connecting Atlanta with Birmingham.  It is four-lane controlled access.  Construction to widen to six lanes from the [[Talladega Speedway]] to Golden Springs Road (also known as the [[Anniston Eastern Bypass|Eastern Bypass]]) is complete {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.\n\n*[[Noble Street]] runs through downtown, lined with office buildings, specialty shops, and restaurants.  A major revitalization effort in 2003 made this street more pedestrian friendly.  The old four-lane thoroughfare was gutted, and turn of the 20th century trolley tracks were removed to help resurface the street.  The road was converted to two lane traffic with wider sidewalks.\n*[[Quintard Avenue]] ([[Alabama State Route 21]]) runs parallel two blocks east of Noble Street.  It serves as the main north\u2013south traffic corridor for Anniston.  The road is six lanes from East P street to 19th Street, and then four lanes.  It connects central [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]] to the south and [[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]], [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]], and the McClellan area of Anniston to the north.  Traffic is relatively heavy on this road around downtown and in Oxford as well.  Since the early 1990s, bypasses have been planned on both sides of town to alleviate traffic.  The North end becomes [[McClellan Blvd]] and heads toward Jacksonville via [[Alabama State Route 21|AL 21]].\n*The [[Anniston Western Bypass|Western Bypass]] ([[State Route 202 (Alabama)|SR-202]]) is a completed project of the Alabama Department of Transportation. It runs from I-20 in Oxford (the Coldwater exit) and runs north into the present AL 202.  It is five lanes wide (handling Anniston Army Depot traffic).  Future plans will extend it on the present County road 109 by widening it to connect with US 431.\n*The [[Anniston Eastern Bypass|Veterans Memorial Parkway]] ([[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]]) is a recently completed project of the Alabama Department of Transportation to build a four-lane highway in Calhoun County. This project will alleviate the high traffic congestion present on Alabama State Route 21 while also opening up new commercial and industrial shipping routes within the region as Interstate 20 will be able to connect quickly with US 431 through a limited access fly-over. It is the largest influx of federal money into the local economy since Fort McClellan closed. More than $21 million has been earmarked for this project.

It runs parallel to [[Interstate 20]] in Oxford.\n*[[Pelham Road]] (Alabama State Route 21) runs through Jacksonville and is a main road for commercial and retail traffic as well as college students commuting to Jacksonville State University.\n\n===Air===\n\nThe [[Anniston Metropolitan Airport]] is a [[general aviation]] facility, south of the city proper, in [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]. Its single asphalt runway is 7,000 feet long and 150 feet wide. [[Birmingham International Airport (US)|Birmingham International Airport]] in [[Birmingham, AL|Birmingham]] is 57 miles west serving commercial flight, as well as [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] {{airport codes|ATL|KATL}}, the world's busiest airport as measured by [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|passenger traffic]] and by [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|aircraft traffic]], provides air service between Atlanta many national and international destinations.\n\n===Train===\n\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent train]] connects Anniston with the cities of [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. The [[Anniston (Amtrak Station)|Amtrak station]] is situated at the Southern Railway Depot (which was built in 1926), located at 126 West 4th Street.  The city purchased the station in 2001 for $430,000 from federal grants for the restoration, in hopes of turning the building into a multi modal transportation hub for the city.  It will serve by [[Amtrak]] (train), [[Greyhound]] (bus), and local taxi and bus services if goes as planned.\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe military has played the biggest part in the economy in Anniston since the turn of the 20th century.  The [[Anniston Army Depot]] which is used for the maintenance of most Army tracked vehicles (the M-1 Abrhams tank) remains in use. The depot formerly housed a major chemical weapons storage facility but those weapons and the equipment to destroy them have been closed since 2013 and will never return.\n\n[[Fort McClellan]], formerly site of the U.S. Army Military Police Training Academy and Chemical Warfare training center, was de-commissioned in 1999.  A commission of local city and county leaders known as the [[McClellan Development Authority]] manages the redevelopment of the old fort.  McClellan has evolved to becoming a master-planned community complete with residential, retail, professional and industrial employers. Millions of dollars in continued access road improvements continue to come to McClellan.

The source of local contamination was a Monsanto chemical factory. The current lead-in on CBS' website states:\n\n{{quote|Imagine a place so saturated with toxic, cancer-causing chemicals that it's in the dirt people walk on, the air they breathe - even the blood that pumps through their veins.\n\nThe 24,000 people living in Anniston, Ala., don't have to imagine this.

These chemical weapons were stored for decades by the US Army for potential use in warfare. Anniston is one of nine areas in the US that housed such stockpiles.

At the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], it had a population of 112,249. The MSA is anchored by significant jobs at Jacksonville State University, the Northeast Alabama Regional Medical Center, Stringfellow Hospital, the Anniston Army Depot, and the Department of Homeland Security at McClellan. McClellan has transitioned from being a closed military base, to becoming the home of hundreds of residents, new retail growth such as a Lowe's Home Improvement Store, and now more than 3,000 jobs spread out over more than 20 employers.  [[Anniston, AL|Anniston]] remains strong in health care, legal, financial services and manufacturing. [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]], with Interstate 20 running right through it, has developed a number of retail and restaurant establishments including the Oxford Exchange which is anchored by Target.\n\n[[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]] is an important city in the region due to its student population and education resources at [[Jacksonville State University]]. The other cities surrounding Anniston\u2013Oxford are [[Piedmont, Alabama|Piedmont]], [[Ohatchee, Alabama|Ohatchee]], [[Hobson City, Alabama|Hobson City]], and [[Weaver, Alabama|Weaver]].\n\n== Counties ==\n'''Alabama'''\n* [[Calhoun County, Alabama|Calhoun]]\n\n== Core cities ==\n\n* [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]\n* [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]]\n\n=== Suburbs with more than 5,000 inhabitants ===\n* [[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]]\n* [[Saks, Alabama|Saks]]\n* [[Choccolocco, Alabama|Choccolocco]] \n* [[Piedmont, Alabama|Piedmont]]\n\n=== Suburbs with less than 5,000 inhabitants ===\n\n* [[Alexandria, Alabama|Alexandria]]\n* [[Hobson City, Alabama|Hobson City]]\n* [[Nances Creek, Alabama|Nances Creek]]\n* [[Ohatchee, Alabama|Ohatchee]]\n* [[Weaver, Alabama|Weaver]]\n* [[West End-Cobb Town, Alabama|West End-Cobb Town]]\n* [[White Plains, Calhoun County, Alabama|White Plains]]\n\n==Education==\n\n===K-12 education===\n'''Public'''\n\n*[[Anniston City Schools]]\n*[[Calhoun County Schools]]\n*[[Oxford City Schools]]\n*[[Jacksonville City Schools]]\n*[[Piedmont City Schools]]\n\n'''Private'''\n*[[The Donoho School]]\n*[[Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School, Anniston|Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School]]\n*[[Jacksonville Christian Academy]]\n*[[Trinity Christian Academy (Alabama)|Trinity Christian Academy]]\nFaith Christian School\n\n===Institutions of higher education===\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n**Main Jacksonville Campus\n**McClellan Campus\n*[[Gadsden State Community College]]\n**Ayers Campus\n**McClellan Campus\n*[[Gadsden Business College]]\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Main roadways===\n\n[[Interstate 20]] runs though the southern portion of the county, connecting Atlanta with Birmingham.  It is four-lane controlled access.  Construction to widen to six lanes from the [[Talladega Speedway]] to Golden Springs Road (also known as the [[Anniston Eastern Bypass|Eastern Bypass]]) is complete {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.\n\n*[[Noble Street]] runs through downtown, lined with office buildings, specialty shops, and restaurants.  A major revitalization effort in 2003 made this street more pedestrian friendly.  The old four-lane thoroughfare was gutted, and turn of the 20th century trolley tracks were removed to help resurface the street.  The road was converted to two lane traffic with wider sidewalks.\n*[[Quintard Avenue]] ([[Alabama State Route 21]]) runs parallel two blocks east of Noble Street.  It serves as the main north\u2013south traffic corridor for Anniston.  The road is six lanes from East P street to 19th Street, and then four lanes.  It connects central [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]] to the south and [[Jacksonville, Alabama|Jacksonville]], [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]], and the McClellan area of Anniston to the north.  Traffic is relatively heavy on this road around downtown and in Oxford as well.  Since the early 1990s, bypasses have been planned on both sides of town to alleviate traffic.  The North end becomes [[McClellan Blvd]] and heads toward Jacksonville via [[Alabama State Route 21|AL 21]].\n*The [[Anniston Western Bypass|Western Bypass]] ([[State Route 202 (Alabama)|SR-202]]) is a completed project of the Alabama Department of Transportation. It runs from I-20 in Oxford (the Coldwater exit) and runs north into the present AL 202.  It is five lanes wide (handling Anniston Army Depot traffic).  Future plans will extend it on the present County road 109 by widening it to connect with US 431.\n*The [[Anniston Eastern Bypass|Veterans Memorial Parkway]] ([[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]]) is a recently completed project of the Alabama Department of Transportation to build a four-lane highway in Calhoun County. This project will alleviate the high traffic congestion present on Alabama State Route 21 while also opening up new commercial and industrial shipping routes within the region as Interstate 20 will be able to connect quickly with US 431 through a limited access fly-over. It is the largest influx of federal money into the local economy since Fort McClellan closed. More than $21 million has been earmarked for this project.

It runs parallel to [[Interstate 20]] in Oxford.\n*[[Pelham Road]] (Alabama State Route 21) runs through Jacksonville and is a main road for commercial and retail traffic as well as college students commuting to Jacksonville State University.\n\n===Air===\n\nThe [[Anniston Metropolitan Airport]] is a [[general aviation]] facility, south of the city proper, in [[Oxford, Alabama|Oxford]]. Its single asphalt runway is 7,000 feet long and 150 feet wide. [[Birmingham International Airport (US)|Birmingham International Airport]] in [[Birmingham, AL|Birmingham]] is 57 miles west serving commercial flight, as well as [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] {{airport codes|ATL|KATL}}, the world's busiest airport as measured by [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|passenger traffic]] and by [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|aircraft traffic]], provides air service between Atlanta many national and international destinations.\n\n===Train===\n\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent train]] connects Anniston with the cities of [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. The [[Anniston (Amtrak Station)|Amtrak station]] is situated at the Southern Railway Depot (which was built in 1926), located at 126 West 4th Street.  The city purchased the station in 2001 for $430,000 from federal grants for the restoration, in hopes of turning the building into a multi modal transportation hub for the city.  It will serve by [[Amtrak]] (train), [[Greyhound]] (bus), and local taxi and bus services if goes as planned.\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe military has played the biggest part in the economy in Anniston since the turn of the 20th century.  The [[Anniston Army Depot]] which is used for the maintenance of most Army tracked vehicles (the M-1 Abrhams tank) remains in use. The depot formerly housed a major chemical weapons storage facility but those weapons and the equipment to destroy them have been closed since 2013 and will never return.\n\n[[Fort McClellan]], formerly site of the U.S. Army Military Police Training Academy and Chemical Warfare training center, was de-commissioned in 1999.  A commission of local city and county leaders known as the [[McClellan Development Authority]] manages the redevelopment of the old fort.  McClellan has evolved to becoming a master-planned community complete with residential, retail, professional and industrial employers. Millions of dollars in continued access road improvements continue to come to McClellan. An industrial department completed with full infrastructure is present at McClellan and in December 2014 its largest employer International Automotive Components of Luxembourg announced a 350 job expansion at the park.<ref>http://blog.al.com/breaking/2013/05/one_year_after_last_chemical_w.html</ref>\n\nA portion of the former fort is now home to the [[United States National Guard|Alabama National Guard]] Training Center.
