Following further assessment of the species\u2019 range and changing environmental conditions, the cavefish was considered an endangered species in 1988. By 1990, a recovery plan was created for the fish, which stipulates that the species would be down-listed when the following three criteria are met: (1) three other viable populations are found in discontinuous aquatic systems outside the Key Cave area, (2) the aquifer recharge areas for all four populations are protected, and (3) all four populations are demonstrated to be stable or increasing over at least a 20-year period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/901025.pdf|title=Alabama Cavefish Recovery Plan|last=|first=|date=1990|website=U.S Fish & Wildlife Service Environmental Conservation Online System|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nIn 2019, amendments to the recovery plan were created that changed the criteria for down-listing and created a criterion for delisting. In order to be delisted, the criteria now stipulate that: (1) the species must demonstrate a stable or increasing trend in the existing Key Cave population, (2) two more cavefish populations must be created, and (3) the aquifer recharge areas must be delineated, mapped, and protected. In order for the cavefish to be delisted entirely, the aquifer recharge area must be protected by a conservation mechanism for at least one of the new populations and all other threats to the cavefish must be addressed or managed, allowing viability for the foreseeable future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/Alabama%20Cavefish%20Recovery%20Plan%20Amendment.pdf|title=Recovery Plan for the Alabama Cavefish|last=|first=|date=2019|website=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Environmental Conservation Online System|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List ===\nThe Alabama Cavefish was first listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 1986 as vulnerable and remained in that category following re-evaluation in 1988. Two years later, the status of the cavefish was reassessed and upgraded to endangered, which was then confirmed by a reassessment in 1994. In 1996, the Alabama Cavefish was again upgraded to critically endangered due to their lack of extent (100 sq. km), low population size, and numerous habitat challenges. The species was last assessed in April of 2012, and although its population trend is stable, it is still listed as critically endangered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/en|title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni|last=Authority)|first=NatureServe (Red List Partner & Red List|date=2012-04-12|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n== Conservation ==\nThere are a few current conservation measures put in place to protect the Alabama cavefish. Along with being listed under the ESA, the species is protected by the [[Lacey Act of 1900|Lacey Act]]. This makes it unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase (alive or dead including parts, products, eggs, or offspring) the Alabama Cavefish. Secondly, The Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns the two entrances to the caves, have installed a fence to limit human disturbance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lastly, in 1997, the Key Cave National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established. The Key Cave NWR aims at ensuring the biological integrity of the cave through protection of sinkholes that carry surface water directly into the aquifer of the cave.<ref name=\":1\">Bernard R. Kuhajda, email message to author, March 19, 2020.</ref>\u00a0 \n\n== Human Impact ==\nThe largest human-induced threat to the survival of the Alabama Cavefish is groundwater contamination within the recharge area of Key Cave. The recharge area is the place where water seeps into the ground and refills the aquifer. A major source of contamination is the chemicals used to cultivate crops grown in the areas surrounding the cave. Furthermore, collection of the species by amateurs or for scientific purposes pose such a major threat due to the already small population size.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Factors Likely to Cause Extinction ==\nMany factors that are likely to cause the extinction of the Alabama Cavefish are associated with the recharge zone of the Key Cave. The degradation of the groundwater due to agrochemicals and the decreasing level of groundwater limit the entry and cycling of uncontaminated water into Key Cave.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the alteration of flood cycles within the aquifer often lead to unsuccessful cavefish reproduction.<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, the [[Gray bat]], Myotis grisescens, which is also protected under the ESA, provides nutrients to the Alabama Cavefish through their guano. Therefore, the threats to this bat species also impact the Alabama Cavefish and their fuel source.<ref name=\":0\" /> All these factors combined with the already small population size and limited home range pose massive threats to the Alabama Cavefish.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=33em}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3061096}}\n\n[[Category:Amblyopsidae]]\n[[Category:Cave fish]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered fauna of the United States]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish of the Southeastern United States|Cavefish, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Endemic fauna of Alabama]]\n[[Category:Fish described in 1974]]\n[[Category:ESA endangered species]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n| name = Alabama cavefish\n| status = CR\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=iucn>{{Cite iucn | author = NatureServe | title = ''Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni'' | volume = 2013 | page = e.T20467A19033986 | date = 2013 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2013-1.RLTS.T20467A19033986.en }} Listed as Critically Endangered (CR B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) v3.1)</ref>\n| image = AlabamaCavefish.jpg\n| genus = Speoplatyrhinus\n| parent_authority = [[John Edward Cooper|J.

Some faithful travelled to several churches to pray at each one's Altar of Repose, a practice called [[Seven Churches Visitation]], which now is associated rather with the morning of Good Friday. The Mass included no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate ceremony later in the day. The Mass itself concluded with a ritual [[Stripping of the Altar|stripping]] of all altars except the altar of repose, leaving only the cross and candlesticks.

In the Catholic ritual, [[clergy]] traditionally begin the service [[prostration|prostrate]] in front of the altar. Mass is not celebrated on Good Friday and the communion distributed at the Celebration of the Lord's Passion is consecrated on Holy Thursday, hence the pre-1955 name \"Mass of the Presanctified\". In Anglican churches, there is no prayer of consecration on Good Friday, and the Reserved Sacrament is distributed at services on that day.  Also in Catholicism, images of saints may, in accordance with local custom, be veiled throughout the last two weeks of Lent. Votive lights before these images are not lit. Crucifixes that are movable are hidden, while those that are not movable are veiled until after the Good Friday service.<ref name=veiling>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur72.htm Covering of Crosses and Images in Lent]</ref> Catholic faithful typically venerate the crucifix by kissing the feet of the corpus. Veneration of a simple wooden cross is common in Anglican worship, with the faithful touching or kissing it.\n\nColors of vestments (and hangings, if kept) vary: no color, red, or black are used in different traditions. The Catholic Church uses red vestments, symbolic of the blood of Jesus Christ, but in the pre-1970 form of the [[Roman Missal]] the priest wears black, changing to violet for the communion part of the service. In Anglican services, [[black vestments]] are sometimes used. In [[The United Methodist Church]], black is the liturgical colour used on Good Friday.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=do7TAAAAMAAJ&q=liturgical+colors+Good+Friday+United+Methodist+Methodist&dq=liturgical+colors+Good+Friday+United+Methodist+Methodist&hl=en&sa=X&ei=agl6T-qZNcbc0QHTltmZDQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwBg|title=Christian Advocate, Volume 5|publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]]|year=1961|quote=The liturgical color for the Lenten season is violet or purple, except for Good Friday when black is used.|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref>  In the [[Lutheran]] churches, there is no liturgical color on Good Friday.

Many of the details that follow hold for Anglican and Evangelical Lutheran churches as well as Catholic worship.  The ceremony of darkness and light is held at the beginning of the [[Easter Vigil]] Mass. The [[paschal candle]], whose lighting symbolizes the resurrection of Christ from the dead,<ref>[http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Paschal-Candle.aspx How do we use a paschal candle]</ref> is lit from the new Easter fire. The solemn procession to the altar with the Paschal candle is formed. Once everyone has processed in, the [[Exsultet]] is intoned.\n\nAfter the Exsultet, everyone is seated and listens to seven readings from the [[Old Testament]] and seven [[Psalms]]. At least three of these readings and associated psalms must be read, which must include the account of the first [[Passover]] from the [[Book of Exodus]]. [[pastoral care|Pastoral]] conditions are taken into account when deciding on the number of readings.<ref name=\"Catholic culture\">[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=1043 Catholic Culture] accessed 12 August 2010</ref><ref name=USCCB>[http://www.nccbuscc.org/liturgy/eastervigil.shtml United States Conference of Catholic Bishops].

In Anglican worship, there are nine possible readings from the [[Old Testament]], and a minimum of two must be read, which must include the account of Israel's deliverance at the Red Sea.\n\nIn Catholic practice, during the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] at the Mass, the organ and church bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in two days.<ref>Catholic City  [http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/h/holy_week.html Tenbrae] Retrieved on April 5, 2007</ref>  If the lights of the Church have been previously left off, they are turned on as the Gloria begins. The Paschal candle is used to bless the [[baptismal font]] to be used in the celebration of the sacrament.  The Great Alleluia is sung before the Gospel is read, [[Alleluia]] being used for the first time since before Lent. People receiving full initiation in the Church, who have completed their training, are given the Sacraments of [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|Christian initiation]] ([[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|confirmation]], and the [[Holy Eucharist]]). In Catholic and Anglican tradition, the Easter Vigil is an especially appropriate day for Holy Baptism.\n\nIn current practice, the use of lighting to signify the emergence from [[sin]] and the resurrection of Jesus varies, from the use of candles held by parishioners as well as [[candelabra]]s lit throughout the church.  If statues and images have been veiled during the last two weeks of Lent, they are unveiled, without ceremony, before the Easter Vigil service begins.<ref name=veiling/> (In the 1962 Catholic missal and earlier missals, they are unveiled during the \"Gloria in Excelsis\" of the Easter Vigil Mass.)\n\nColor of vestments and hangings: white, often together with gold, with yellow and white flowers often in use in many parishes.\n\nEaster Masses are held throughout the day and are similar in content to the Easter Vigil Mass. Jesus was a good man and so is Rozz\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n==Easter time==\n{{Main|Eastertide}}\nThe date of Easter [[Easter#Date|varies from year to year]]. It occurs on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after 21 March, a date taken, in accordance with an ancient ecclesiastical tradition, to be that of the spring equinox, but which does not always correspond to the astronomical equinox. The [[Julian Calendar]] is taken as the basis of the calculations by nearly all [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and is accepted even by [[Latin Church]] Catholics in countries such as [[Ethiopia]] and [[Greece]].   In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Julian Calendar's 21 March corresponds to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]], the calendar used for civil purposes in most countries. The earliest possible date for Easter is 22 March, and the latest 25 April. These dates in the Julian Calendar now correspond to the Gregorian Calendar's 4 April and 8 May.\n\nDuring the Easter [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] (and also during Holy Week) no other feast is celebrated. If Easter is very early, the solemnity of the [[Annunciation]] (25 March) may fall within the octave or Holy Week and is then transferred to the Monday after the octave.<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 60. This is an exception to the normal rule that impeded solemnities are transferred to the closest day not ranked as feast or higher.</ref>\n\nThe Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter have precedence over all feasts and solemnities, solemnities being then transferred to the following Monday, unless they occur on Palm Sunday or on Sunday of the Lord's Resurrection.<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 5</ref> \"The Solemnity of Saint Joseph, where it is observed as a Holyday of Obligation, should it fall on Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion, is anticipated on the preceding Saturday, 18 March. Where, on the other hand, it is not observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it may be transferred by the Conference of Bishops to another day outside Lent.\"<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 56</ref>\n\nThe solemnity of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] is on the fortieth day of Easter, which is always a Thursday, although it may be observed on the following Sunday. [[Pentecost]] (or [[Whitsun]]) is the fiftieth day.\n\nThe Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday on the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and Protestant calendars. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar the octave of Pentecost is included in Eastertide, which thus ends at [[None (liturgy)|None]] of the following [[Ember Saturday]].\n\nDuring the 50-day Easter period, vestments are generally white or gold, but red when celebrating apostles and martyrs and on the solemnity of Pentecost. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar, with its 56-day Eastertide, red was used during the octave of Pentecost.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holy Week]]\n*[[Holy Week procession]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/triduumquestions.shtml Eighteen Questions on the Paschal Triduum]\n*[http://www.gbod.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=nhLRJ2PMKsG&b=5560695&ct=7793155#notes The Three Days (The United Methodist Church GBOD)]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Catholic spirituality]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:Catholic devotions]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Meister des Hausbuches 003.jpg|thumb|''Christ Washing the Feet of the Apostles'' by Meister des Hausbuches, 1475 ([[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]], [[Berlin]])]]\nThe '''Paschal Triduum''' ([[Latin]]: ''Triduum Paschale''),<ref>For the etymology of the term ''Paschal'' see ''[[Names of Easter#From Greek Pascha|Names of Easter]]''.</ref> '''Holy Triduum''' (Latin: ''Triduum Sacrum''), or '''Easter Triduum''', or the '''Three Days''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Planning/Three-Days.aspx|title=The Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter|year=2012|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> is the period of three days that begins with the liturgy on the evening of [[Maundy Thursday]],<ref name=\"CL Thurs\">[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/324/Start/319 Catholic Liturgy, Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper]</ref> reaches its high point in the [[Easter Vigil]], and closes with evening prayer on [[Easter Sunday]]. <ref name=General>[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/101/Start/97 General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 19]</ref> It recalls the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Death]], [[entombment of Christ|burial]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus]], as portrayed in the [[canonical Gospels]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bibleresources.americanbible.org/bible-resources/bible</ref>\n\nIn the [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], and [[Reformed]] traditions, the Paschal Triduum straddles the two liturgical seasons of [[Lent]] and [[Eastertide|Easter]] in the [[Church calendar]]; however, in the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, since the [[Pope Pius XII#Liturgy reforms|1955 reform]] by [[Pope Pius XII]], the Easter Triduum has been more clearly distinguished as a separate liturgical period.

[[Eucharistic adoration]] is encouraged after this, but if continued after midnight should be done without outward solemnity.<ref name=\"CL Thurs\" /> In the form of the [[Roman Rite]] in use before 1955, Mass was celebrated in the morning. Some faithful travelled to several churches to pray at each one's Altar of Repose, a practice called [[Seven Churches Visitation]], which now is associated rather with the morning of Good Friday. The Mass included no washing of the feet, which could instead be done in a separate ceremony later in the day. The Mass itself concluded with a ritual [[Stripping of the Altar|stripping]] of all altars except the altar of repose, leaving only the cross and candlesticks. In the present form as revised in 1955, the altar is stripped bare without ceremony at some time after the evening Mass.\n\nThe [[liturgical colour]] for the Mass vestments and other ornaments is white in the Catholic and Anglican Churches.<ref>[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 346]</ref> In the Lutheran Church, the liturgical colour for Maundy Thursday is white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Liturgical-Colors.aspx|title=What is the meaning and use of liturgical colors?|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]|quote=Maundy Thursday: For this fourth day of Holy Week, celebrated as the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper, scarlet or white is used.|accessdate=1 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404093828/http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Liturgical-Colors.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012}}</ref> In the [[Reformed]] tradition, white or gold may be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/worship/liturgies/liturgical-colors.html?print=t|title=Liturgical Colors and the seasons of the church year|publisher=[[United Church of Christ]]|quote=On Maundy Thursday, White or Gold symbolizes the church's rejoicing in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.

In the Catholic ritual, [[clergy]] traditionally begin the service [[prostration|prostrate]] in front of the altar. Mass is not celebrated on Good Friday and the communion distributed at the Celebration of the Lord's Passion is consecrated on Holy Thursday, hence the pre-1955 name \"Mass of the Presanctified\". In Anglican churches, there is no prayer of consecration on Good Friday, and the Reserved Sacrament is distributed at services on that day.  Also in Catholicism, images of saints may, in accordance with local custom, be veiled throughout the last two weeks of Lent. Votive lights before these images are not lit. Crucifixes that are movable are hidden, while those that are not movable are veiled until after the Good Friday service.<ref name=veiling>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur72.htm Covering of Crosses and Images in Lent]</ref> Catholic faithful typically venerate the crucifix by kissing the feet of the corpus. Veneration of a simple wooden cross is common in Anglican worship, with the faithful touching or kissing it.\n\nColors of vestments (and hangings, if kept) vary: no color, red, or black are used in different traditions. The Catholic Church uses red vestments, symbolic of the blood of Jesus Christ, but in the pre-1970 form of the [[Roman Missal]] the priest wears black, changing to violet for the communion part of the service. In Anglican services, [[black vestments]] are sometimes used. In [[The United Methodist Church]], black is the liturgical colour used on Good Friday.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=do7TAAAAMAAJ&q=liturgical+colors+Good+Friday+United+Methodist+Methodist&dq=liturgical+colors+Good+Friday+United+Methodist+Methodist&hl=en&sa=X&ei=agl6T-qZNcbc0QHTltmZDQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwBg|title=Christian Advocate, Volume 5|publisher=[[The United Methodist Church]]|year=1961|quote=The liturgical color for the Lenten season is violet or purple, except for Good Friday when black is used.|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref>  In the [[Lutheran]] churches, there is no liturgical color on Good Friday.  Altars remain stripped and clergy wear no vestments on this day.\n\n==Holy Saturday==\n[[File:Resurrection.JPG|thumb|250px|''Jesus Resurrected'' by [[Piero della Francesca]] (15th century).]] \n\nAlso called Black Saturday, is a vigil service that is held after nightfall on Holy Saturday, or before dawn on Easter Sunday, in commemoration Jesus' death and [[harrowing of Hell]]. Many of the details that follow hold for Anglican and Evangelical Lutheran churches as well as Catholic worship.  The ceremony of darkness and light is held at the beginning of the [[Easter Vigil]] Mass. The [[paschal candle]], whose lighting symbolizes the resurrection of Christ from the dead,<ref>[http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/FAQs/Paschal-Candle.aspx How do we use a paschal candle]</ref> is lit from the new Easter fire. The solemn procession to the altar with the Paschal candle is formed. Once everyone has processed in, the [[Exsultet]] is intoned.\n\nAfter the Exsultet, everyone is seated and listens to seven readings from the [[Old Testament]] and seven [[Psalms]]. At least three of these readings and associated psalms must be read, which must include the account of the first [[Passover]] from the [[Book of Exodus]]. [[pastoral care|Pastoral]] conditions are taken into account when deciding on the number of readings.<ref name=\"Catholic culture\">[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=1043 Catholic Culture] accessed 12 August 2010</ref><ref name=USCCB>[http://www.nccbuscc.org/liturgy/eastervigil.shtml United States Conference of Catholic Bishops].

Accessed 12 August 2010</ref> These readings account salvation history, beginning with Creation. In Anglican worship, there are nine possible readings from the [[Old Testament]], and a minimum of two must be read, which must include the account of Israel's deliverance at the Red Sea.\n\nIn Catholic practice, during the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] at the Mass, the organ and church bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in two days.<ref>Catholic City  [http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/h/holy_week.html Tenbrae] Retrieved on April 5, 2007</ref>  If the lights of the Church have been previously left off, they are turned on as the Gloria begins. The Paschal candle is used to bless the [[baptismal font]] to be used in the celebration of the sacrament.  The Great Alleluia is sung before the Gospel is read, [[Alleluia]] being used for the first time since before Lent. People receiving full initiation in the Church, who have completed their training, are given the Sacraments of [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|Christian initiation]] ([[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|confirmation]], and the [[Holy Eucharist]]). In Catholic and Anglican tradition, the Easter Vigil is an especially appropriate day for Holy Baptism.\n\nIn current practice, the use of lighting to signify the emergence from [[sin]] and the resurrection of Jesus varies, from the use of candles held by parishioners as well as [[candelabra]]s lit throughout the church.  If statues and images have been veiled during the last two weeks of Lent, they are unveiled, without ceremony, before the Easter Vigil service begins.<ref name=veiling/> (In the 1962 Catholic missal and earlier missals, they are unveiled during the \"Gloria in Excelsis\" of the Easter Vigil Mass.)\n\nColor of vestments and hangings: white, often together with gold, with yellow and white flowers often in use in many parishes.\n\nEaster Masses are held throughout the day and are similar in content to the Easter Vigil Mass.\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n==Easter time==\n{{Main|Eastertide}}\nThe date of Easter [[Easter#Date|varies from year to year]]. It occurs on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after 21 March, a date taken, in accordance with an ancient ecclesiastical tradition, to be that of the spring equinox, but which does not always correspond to the astronomical equinox. The [[Julian Calendar]] is taken as the basis of the calculations by nearly all [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and is accepted even by [[Latin Church]] Catholics in countries such as [[Ethiopia]] and [[Greece]].   In the 20th and 21st centuries, the Julian Calendar's 21 March corresponds to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]], the calendar used for civil purposes in most countries. The earliest possible date for Easter is 22 March, and the latest 25 April. These dates in the Julian Calendar now correspond to the Gregorian Calendar's 4 April and 8 May.\n\nDuring the Easter [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] (and also during Holy Week) no other feast is celebrated. If Easter is very early, the solemnity of the [[Annunciation]] (25 March) may fall within the octave or Holy Week and is then transferred to the Monday after the octave.<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 60. This is an exception to the normal rule that impeded solemnities are transferred to the closest day not ranked as feast or higher.</ref>\n\nThe Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter have precedence over all feasts and solemnities, solemnities being then transferred to the following Monday, unless they occur on Palm Sunday or on Sunday of the Lord's Resurrection.<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 5</ref> \"The Solemnity of Saint Joseph, where it is observed as a Holyday of Obligation, should it fall on Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion, is anticipated on the preceding Saturday, 18 March. Where, on the other hand, it is not observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it may be transferred by the Conference of Bishops to another day outside Lent.\"<ref>Universal Norms on the Calendar, 56</ref>\n\nThe solemnity of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] is on the fortieth day of Easter, which is always a Thursday, although it may be observed on the following Sunday. [[Pentecost]] (or [[Whitsun]]) is the fiftieth day.\n\nThe Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday on the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic and Protestant calendars. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar the octave of Pentecost is included in Eastertide, which thus ends at [[None (liturgy)|None]] of the following [[Ember Saturday]].\n\nDuring the 50-day Easter period, vestments are generally white or gold, but red when celebrating apostles and martyrs and on the solemnity of Pentecost. In the pre-1970 Roman Catholic calendar, with its 56-day Eastertide, red was used during the octave of Pentecost.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holy Week]]\n*[[Holy Week procession]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/triduumquestions.shtml Eighteen Questions on the Paschal Triduum]\n*[http://www.gbod.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=nhLRJ2PMKsG&b=5560695&ct=7793155#notes The Three Days (The United Methodist Church GBOD)]\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Catholic spirituality]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:Catholic devotions]]\n", "name_user": "72.234.59.60", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHoly Saturday)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschal_Triduum"}

The Steppe Route has always connected regions of the Asian continent with trade and transmission of culture, including clothing.\n\nAround 114 BC, the [[Han Dynasty]],<ref>Elisseeff, Vadime, ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce'', UNESCO Publishing / Berghahn Books, 2001, {{ISBN|978-92-3-103652-1}}</ref> initiated the [[Silk Road]] Trade Route. Geographically, the Silk Road or Silk Route is an interconnected series of ancient trade routes between [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) in China, with [[Asia Minor]] and the Mediterranean extending over {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on}} on land and sea. Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great [[civilization]]s of China, Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], the Indian subcontinent, and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world. The exchange of luxury textiles was predominant on the [[Silk Road]], which linked traders, merchants, [[pilgrim]]s, [[monk]]s, soldiers, [[nomad]]s and urban dwellers from China to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during various periods of time.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\nThe earliest known woven textiles of the [[Near East]] may be fabrics used to wrap the dead, excavated at a [[Neolithic]] site at [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] in [[Anatolia]], carbonized in a fire and [[radiocarbon]] dated to c. 6000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\">Jenkins, pp. 39\u201347</ref> Evidence exists of [[flax]] cultivation from c. 8000 BC in the Near East, but the breeding of sheep with a wooly [[Wool|fleece]] rather than hair occurs much later, c. 3000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\" />\n\nIn [[Mesopotamia]], the clothing of a regular [[Sumer|Sumerian]] was very simple, especially in summer, in the winter wearing clothes made of sheep fur. Even wealthy men were depicted with naked torsos, wearing just some kind of short skirt, known as ''[[kaunakes]]'', while women wore long dress to their ankles. The king wore a tunic, a coat that reached to his knees, with a belt in the middle. Over time, the development of the craft of wool weaving has led to a great variety in clothing. Thus, towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC  and later the men wore a tunic with short sleeves and even over the knees, with a belt (over which the rich wore a wool cloak).

Any cloth that might have been worn has long since disintegrated and we have not yet been able to decipher the Indus script. However, historians and archaeologists have managed to piece together some bits of information from clues found in sculptures and figurines.\n\nTerracotta figurines uncovered at Mehrgarh show a male figure wearing what is commonly interpreted to be a turban; female figurines depict women with elaborate headdress and intricate hairstyles.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=24966394|title=The Antecedents of Civilization in the Indus Valley|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last1=Jarrige|first2=Richard H.|last2=Meadow|date=8 May 1980|journal=Scientific American|volume=243|issue=2|pages=122\u2013137|bibcode=1980SciAm.243b.122J|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0880-122}}</ref> In certain cases, these headdresses have led historians to attach a religious connotation to the figurines and to the interpret the headdresses as symbols of a mother goddess.\n\nOne of the most important recovered figurines is that of the \"Priest King\" from the site of [[Mohenjo-daro]]. It is not only important because scholars have called it a representation of an assumed authority or head of state but also because of what it is wearing, however, it was recently discovered to be an interpretation of a wealthy trader. The calmly seated Priest-King is depicted wearing a shawl with floral patterns. So far, this is the only sculpture from the Indus Valley to show clothing in such explicit detail. However, it does not provide any concrete proof to legitimize the history of clothing in the Harappan times. Harappans may even have used natural colours to dye their fabric. Research shows that the cultivation of indigo plants (genus: '''''[[Indigofera]]''''') was prevalent.\n\nAnother important sculpture is of a dancing girl, also excavated from Mohenjo-daro. She is depicted with no clothing other than a number of bangles upon her arm. B. B.

He notices how contemporary women continue wearing those bangles even today. Harappans may not have left any evidence of what clothing or textiles they had at that time but they did leave remains of jewellery and beads in large amounts. For instance, the graves of Harappans have yielded various forms of jewellery such as neckpieces, bracelets, rings, and head ornaments. Multiple beads of varying shapes and sizes have also been recovered. This jewellery incorporates various materials such as gold, bronze, terracotta, faience, and shells; imported materials including turquoise and lapis lazuli were used too. This suggests that the Harappans might have engaged in long-distance trade. Long, slender [[carnelian]] beads were highly prized by the Harappans. Harappans were also experts in manufacturing microbeads, which have been found in various locations from hearths and graves. These beads were extremely hard to work with and needed extra precision to produce. A special drill has been found both at Lothal and Chanhudaro. Chanhudaro was a centre exclusively devoted to craft production.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMohenjo-daro Priesterk\u00f6nig.jpeg|Statue of \"Priest King\" wearing a robe; 2400\u20131900 BCE; low fired [[steatite]]; [[National Museum of Pakistan]] ([[Karachi]])\nDidarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg|The [[Didarganj Yakshi]] depicting the ''dhoti wrap''; circa 300 BC; [[Bihar Museum]] (India)\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes; circa 200 BC; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Japan)\nGuptaDanceMusic02.jpg|Ancient form of ''[[Churidar]]'' worn during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]]; circa 300 AD; [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] ([[New Delhi]])\nRaja Ravi Varma - Mahabharata - Shakuntala.jpg|[[Shakuntala]], wife of [[Dushyanta]] and the mother of [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Emperor Bharata]], from [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa|Kalidasa]]'s play ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', wearing a [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]\nBritish Museum silk princess painting.jpg|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid silk worm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan; 7th to 8th century; [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{Main|Clothing in ancient Egypt}}\nEvidence exists for production of linen cloth in [[Ancient Egypt]] in the Neolithic period, c. 5500 BC.

Tha Kae was inhabited during the end of the first millennium BC to the late first millennium AD.  Here, archaeologists discovered 90 fragments of spindle whorl dated from 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD. And the shape of these finds indicate the connections with south China and India.<ref>Cameron, J. (2011). Iron and cloth across the Bay of Bengal: new data from Tha Kae, central Thailand. Antiquity, 85(328).</ref> A spindle whorl is a disc or spherical object that fits onto the spindle to increase as well as maintain the speed of spinning.\n\n===Ancient Japan===\nThe earliest evidence of weaving in Japan is associated with the [[J\u014dmon period]]. This culture is defined by pottery decorated with cord patterns. In a shell mound in the Miyagi Prefecture, dating back about 5,500, some cloth fragments were discovered made from bark fibers.<ref>Liddell, Jill, ''The story of the Kimono'', E. P. Dutton New Zork, 1989, {{ISBN|0-525-24574-X}}</ref> Hemp fibers were also discovered in the [[Torihama shell mound]], Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the J\u014dmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the J\u014dmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers,  funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. The pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.<ref>Zamanaka, Norio, ''The Book of Kimono'', Kodansha International, 1986, {{ISBN|0-87011-785-8}}</ref>\n\nNext was the Yayoi period, during which rice cultivation was developed. This led to a shift from hunter-gatherer communities to agrarian societies which had a large impact on clothing. According to Chinese literature from that time period, clothing more appropriate to agriculture began to be worn. For example, an unsewn length of fabric wrapped around the body, or a poncho-type garment with a head-hole cut into it. This same literature also indicates that pink or scarlet makeup was worn but also that mannerisms between people of all ages and genders were not very different. However, this is debatable as there were probably cultural prejudices in the Chinese document. There is a common Japanese belief that the Yayoi time period was quite utopian before Chinese influence began to promote the use of clothing to indicate age and gender.\n\nFrom 300 to 550 AD was the Yamato period, and here much of the clothing style can be derived from the artifacts of the time. The tomb statues (haniwa) especially tell us that the clothing style changed from the ones according to the Chinese accounts from the previous age. The statues are usually wearing a two piece outfit that has an upper piece with a front opening and close-cut sleeves with loose trousers for men and a pleated skirt for women. Silk farming had been introduced by the Chinese by this time period but due to silk's cost it would only be used by people of certain classes or ranks.\n\nThe following periods were the Asuka (550 to 646 AD) and Nara (646 to 794 AD) when Japan developed a more unified government and began to use Chinese laws and social rankings. These new laws required people to wear different styles and colors to indicate social status. Clothing became longer and wider in general and sewing methods were more advanced.<ref>Slade, T. (2009). Japanese fashion a cultural history (English ed.). Oxford: Berg.</ref>\n\n===Classical Period of the Philippines===\n[[File:Naturales 5.png|thumb|100px|The [[Boxer Codex]], showing the attire of a Classical period Filipino, made of [[silk]] and [[cotton]].]]\nThe classical Filipino clothing varied according to cost and current fashions and so indicated social standing. The basic garments were the Bahag  and the tube skirt\u2014what the Maranao call malong\u2014or a light blanket wrapped around instead. But more prestigious clothes, lihin-lihin, were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions\u2014[[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with [[sleeves]], capes, or ankle-length robes. The textiles of which they were made were similarly varied. In ascending order of value, they were [[abaca]], abaca decorated with colored [[cotton]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[cotton]], cotton decorated with silk thread, silk, imported printstuff, and an elegant abaca woven of selected fibers almost as thin as [[silk]]. In addition, Pigafetta mentioned both G-strings and skirts of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cloth.\n\nUntailored clothes, however had no particular names. ''Pandong'', a lady's [[cloak]], simply meant any natural covering, like the growth on banana trunk's or a natal caul. In [[Panay]], the word ''kurong'', meaning curly hair, was applied to any short skirt or blouse; and some better ones made of imported chintz or calico were simply called by the name of the cloth itself, tabas. So, too, the wraparound skirt the Tagalogs called tapis was hardly considered a skirt at all: Visayans just called it habul (woven stuff) or halong ([[abaca]]) or even hulun ([[sash]]).\n\nThe usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban, though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong\u2014as'' the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy. The most prestigious kind of ''pudong'', limited to the most valiant, was, like their G-strings, made of pinayusan, a gauze-thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness, tie-dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery, and burnished to a silky sheen. Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor: real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness.\nWomen generally wore a kerchief, called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head; but they also had a broad-brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak, woven of sago-palm leaves. Some were evidently signs of rank: when Humabon's queen went to hear mass during Magellan's visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural & History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106060654/http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{Main|Clothing in the ancient world|Clothing in ancient Greece|Clothing in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:ChitonAndHimation.png|thumb|200px|Greek chiton (left) and chiton worn under himation]]\nFabric in Ancient Greece was woven on a warp-weighted loom.

Typical garments were the [[peplos]], a loose robe worn by women; the [[chlamys]], a [[cloak]] worn by men; and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], a tunic worn by both men and women. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. A long cloak called a [[himation]] was worn over the peplos or chlamys.\n\nThe [[toga]] of ancient Rome was also an unsewn length of wool cloth, worn by male citizens draped around the body in various fashions, over a simple [[tunic]]. Early tunics were two simple rectangles joined at the shoulders and sides; later tunics had sewn [[sleeve]]s. Women wore the draped [[stola]] or an ankle-length tunic, with a [[shawl]]-like [[palla (garment)|palla]] as an outer garment. Wool was the preferred fabric, although linen, [[hemp]], and small amounts of expensive imported silk and cotton were also worn.\n\n===Iron Age Europe===\nThe [[Iron Age]] is broadly identified as stretching from the end of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the [[Medieval]] period. Bodies and clothing have been found from this period, preserved by the anaerobic and acidic conditions of [[peat bogs]] in northwestern Europe. A Danish recreation of clothing found with such bodies indicates woven wool dresses, tunics and skirts.<ref>[http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp The Tollund Man \u2013 Clothes and Fashion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118112211/http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp |date=18 January 2012 }}.

People in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new [[migration period|invading populations]] such as [[Franks]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Visigoths]]. Men of the invading peoples generally wore short [[tunic]]s, with belts, and visible trousers, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] or leggings. The Romanised populations, and the Church, remained faithful to the longer tunics of Roman formal costume.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nThe elite imported silk cloth from the Byzantine, and later Muslim, worlds, and also probably cotton. They also could afford bleached linen and dyed and simply patterned wool woven in Europe itself. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art. Lower classes wore local or homespun wool, often undyed, trimmed with bands of decoration, variously [[embroidery]], [[tablet weaving|tablet-woven]] bands, or colorful borders woven into the fabric in the loom.<ref>[[Gale Owen-Crocker|Owen-Crocker, Gale R.]], ''Dress in Anglo-Saxon England'', revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-84383-081-7}} pp. 309\u2013315</ref><ref name=\"Norse\">\u00d8sterg\u00e5rd, Else, ''Woven into the Earth: Textiles from Norse Greenland'', Aarhus University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|87-7288-935-7}}</ref>\n\n===High middle ages and the rise of fashion===\n{{Main|1100\u20131200 in fashion|1200\u20131300 in fashion|1300\u20131400 in fashion}}\n[[File:ItalianSilkDamask.jpg|left|150px|thumb|14th-century Italian silk damasks]]\nClothing in 12th and 13th century Europe remained very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the subcontinent. The traditional combination of short tunic with hose for working-class men and long tunic with overdress for women and upper class men remained the norm. Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe 13th century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear. Linen was increasingly used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin. Unlike wool, linen could be laundered and bleached in the sun. Cotton, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as [[buckram]] and [[fustian]].\n\n[[Crusades|Crusaders]] returning from the [[Levant]] brought knowledge of its fine textiles, including light silks, to Western Europe.

Even though the purdah was made compulsory for the Mughal women, we see that this did not stop themselves from experimenting in style and attire. Abul Fazal mentions that there were sixteen components that adorned a woman. These not only included clothing but also other aspects like that of oiling the body and iqtar. Mughal women wore long loose jamas with full sleeves and in winters it was accompanied by a Qaba or a Kashmir shawl used as a coat. Women were very fond of their perfumes and scents. Jewellery in the Mughal tradition signified not only religious values but also style statements.\n\n===Pre-Colonial North America===\n{{main|Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nAcross North America, native people constructed clothing using natural fibers such as cotton and agave as well as leather skins from animals such as deer or beavers. When traders and colonists came from Europe, they brought with them sheep and travelers highly valued the beaver pelts in particular for their warmth. Beaver pelt trade was one of the first commercial endeavors of colonial North America and a cause of the [[Beaver Wars]].\n\n==Enlightenment and the Colonial period==\n{{main|1700\u20131750 in fashion|1750\u20131795 in fashion}}\nDuring the 18th century, distinction was made between ''full dress'' worn at Court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress which had all but disappeared by the end of the century. Full dress followed the styles of the French court, where rich silks and elaborate embroidery reigned. Men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] for both full dress and undress; these were now sometimes made of the same fabric and trim, signalling the birth of the three-piece [[suit (clothes)|suit]].\n\nWomen's silhouettes featured small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]] in the 1730s and early 1740s, which were displaced for formal court wear by side hoops or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]] which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the court of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Fashion reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], before new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits and a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of British woollen tailoring following the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFor women's dresses, Indian cottons, especially printed [[chintz]]es, were imported to Europe in large numbers, and towards the end of the period simple white [[muslin]] dresses were in fashion.\n\n==Industrial revolution==\n[[File:Textile machinery at Cambrian Factory, Llanwrtyd (1293828).jpg|thumb|Textile machinery at the Cambrian Factory, [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Wales]] in the 1940s.]]\n[[File:T\u00dc RKA Gaudeamusel L\u00e4tis.JPG|thumb|[[Estonia]]n national clothes are a fine example of change in clothing after the industrial revolution. They changed a lot during 18th and 19th of century with the addition of new types of colors (like [[aniline]] dyes), placement of colors (like lengthwise stripes) and with the addition of new elements (like waistcoats). By the end of the 19th century they went out of use in most of the country (except more remote places as in [[Kihnu]] island) and it was only in mid 20th century when they once again gained popularity and now as a formal clothing.

Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organisation. Clothing production, on the other hand, continued to be made by hand.\n\n[[Sewing machine]]s emerged in the 19th century<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/loom_4.htm Spindel, Loom, and Needle] \u2013 History of the Textile Industry</ref> streamlining clothing production.\n\nTextiles were not only made in factories. Before this, they were made in local and national markets. Dramatic change in transportation throughout the nation is one source that encouraged the use of factories. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. Between 1810 and 1840, the development of a national market prompted manufacturing which tripled the output's worth. This increase in production created a change in industrial methods, such as the use of factories instead of hand made woven materials that families usually made.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. J.

Women went to work in textile factories for a number of reasons. Some women left home to live on their own because of crowding at home; or to save for future marriage portions. The work enabled them to see more of the world, to earn something in anticipation of marriage, and to ease the crowding within the home. They also did it to make money for family back home. The money they sent home was to help out with the trouble some of the farmers were having. They also worked in the millhouses because they could gain a sense of independence and growth as a personal goal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Dublin|title=Transforming women's work: New England lives in the industrial revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTfTKyrIGfgC&pg=PA82|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=August 1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8090-4|pages=82\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==20th-century developments==\n\nThe 20th century is marked by new applications for textiles as well as inventions in synthetic fibers and computerized manufacturing control systems.\n\n===Unions and education===\n\nIn the early 20th century, workers in the clothing and textile industries became [[Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union|unionized]] in the United States.

These properties may be implemented through mechanical solutions, such as different weaving and knitting patterns, by modifications to the fibers, or by finishing (textiles) of the textiles. Since the 1960s, it has been possible to finish textiles to resist stains, flames, wrinkles, and microbial life. Advancement in dye technology allowed for coloring of previously difficult-to-dye natural fibers and synthetic fibers.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\">{{cite book | title = Textiles, 12th edition | author1 = Sara J. Kadolph | author2 = Sara B. Marcketti | publisher = Pearson |date = 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Synthetic fibers===\n\nFollowing the invention of plastics by petroleum and chemical corporations, fibers could now be made synthetically. Advancements in fiber spinning actuators and control systems allow control over fiber diameter and shape, so Synthetic fibers, may be engineered with more precision than natural fibers. Fibers invented between 1930 and 1970 include nylon, PTFE, polyester, Spandex, and Kevlar. Clothing producers soon adopted synthetic fibers, often using blends of different fibers for optimized properties.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\"/> Synthetic fibers can be knit and woven similarly to natural fibers.\n\n===Automation and numeric control===\n\nThe early 20th century continued the advances of the Industrial Revolution. In The procedural loops required for mechanized textile knitting and weaving already used logic were encoded in punch-cards and tapes. Since the machines were already computers, the invention of small-scale electronics and microcontrollers did not immediately change the possible functions of these machines. In the 1960s, existing machines became outfitted with computerized numeric control (CNC) systems, enabling more accurate and efficient actuation. In 1983, Bonas Machine Company Ltd. presented the first computer-controlled, [[Jacquard loom#Electronic Jacquard looms|electronic, Jacquard loom]].<ref>[https://www.bonas.be/en/about-us Bonas.co.uk]</ref> In 1988, the first US patent was awarded for a \"pick and place\" robot.<ref>{{cite patent | country=US | number=4872258A| pubdate=1988-09-22 | inventor=Philip A Ragard | url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4872258A/en}}</ref> Advancements such as these changed the nature of work for machine operators, introducing computer literacy as a skill alongside machine literacy.

In northern [[Eurasia]], [[peat bog]]s can also preserve textiles very well. The first known textile of South America was discovered in Guitarrero Cave in Peru. It was woven out of vegetable fibers and dates back to 8,000 B.C.E.\n\nFrom pre-history through the early Middle Ages, for most of Europe, the Near East and North Africa, two main types of loom dominate textile production. These are the [[warp-weighted loom]] and the two-beam loom. The length of the cloth beam determined the width of the cloth woven upon it, and could be as wide as 2\u20133 meters.

The Steppe Route has always connected regions of the Asian continent with trade and transmission of culture, including clothing.\n\nAround 114 BC, the [[Han Dynasty]],<ref>Elisseeff, Vadime, ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce'', UNESCO Publishing / Berghahn Books, 2001, {{ISBN|978-92-3-103652-1}}</ref> initiated the [[Silk Road]] Trade Route.

Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great [[civilization]]s of China, Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], the Indian subcontinent, and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world. The exchange of luxury textiles was predominant on the [[Silk Road]], which linked traders, merchants, [[pilgrim]]s, [[monk]]s, soldiers, [[nomad]]s and urban dwellers from China to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during various periods of time.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\nThe earliest known woven textiles of the [[Near East]] may be fabrics used to wrap the dead, excavated at a [[Neolithic]] site at [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] in [[Anatolia]], carbonized in a fire and [[radiocarbon]] dated to c. 6000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\">Jenkins, pp. 39\u201347</ref> Evidence exists of [[flax]] cultivation from c. 8000 BC in the Near East, but the breeding of sheep with a wooly [[Wool|fleece]] rather than hair occurs much later, c. 3000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\" />\n\nIn [[Mesopotamia]], the clothing of a regular [[Sumer|Sumerian]] was very simple, especially in summer, in the winter wearing clothes made of sheep fur. Even wealthy men were depicted with naked torsos, wearing just some kind of short skirt, known as ''[[kaunakes]]'', while women wore long dress to their ankles. The king wore a tunic, a coat that reached to his knees, with a belt in the middle. Over time, the development of the craft of wool weaving has led to a great variety in clothing. Thus, towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC  and later the men wore a tunic with short sleeves and even over the knees, with a belt (over which the rich wore a wool cloak).

Any cloth that might have been worn has long since disintegrated and we have not yet been able to decipher the Indus script. However, historians and archaeologists have managed to piece together some bits of information from clues found in sculptures and figurines.\n\nTerracotta figurines uncovered at Mehrgarh show a male figure wearing what is commonly interpreted to be a turban; female figurines depict women with elaborate headdress and intricate hairstyles.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=24966394|title=The Antecedents of Civilization in the Indus Valley|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last1=Jarrige|first2=Richard H.|last2=Meadow|date=8 May 1980|journal=Scientific American|volume=243|issue=2|pages=122\u2013137|bibcode=1980SciAm.243b.122J|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0880-122}}</ref> In certain cases, these headdresses have led historians to attach a religious connotation to the figurines and to the interpret the headdresses as symbols of a mother goddess.\n\nOne of the most important recovered figurines is that of the \"Priest King\" from the site of [[Mohenjo-daro]]. It is not only important because scholars have called it a representation of an assumed authority or head of state but also because of what it is wearing, however, it was recently discovered to be an interpretation of a wealthy trader. The calmly seated Priest-King is depicted wearing a shawl with floral patterns. So far, this is the only sculpture from the Indus Valley to show clothing in such explicit detail. However, it does not provide any concrete proof to legitimize the history of clothing in the Harappan times. Harappans may even have used natural colours to dye their fabric. Research shows that the cultivation of indigo plants (genus: '''''[[Indigofera]]''''') was prevalent.\n\nAnother important sculpture is of a dancing girl, also excavated from Mohenjo-daro. She is depicted with no clothing other than a number of bangles upon her arm. B. B.

He notices how contemporary women continue wearing those bangles even today. Harappans may not have left any evidence of what clothing or textiles they had at that time but they did leave remains of jewellery and beads in large amounts. For instance, the graves of Harappans have yielded various forms of jewellery such as neckpieces, bracelets, rings, and head ornaments. Multiple beads of varying shapes and sizes have also been recovered. This jewellery incorporates various materials such as gold, bronze, terracotta, faience, and shells; imported materials including turquoise and lapis lazuli were used too. This suggests that the Harappans might have engaged in long-distance trade. Long, slender [[carnelian]] beads were highly prized by the Harappans. Harappans were also experts in manufacturing microbeads, which have been found in various locations from hearths and graves. These beads were extremely hard to work with and needed extra precision to produce. A special drill has been found both at Lothal and Chanhudaro. Chanhudaro was a centre exclusively devoted to craft production.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMohenjo-daro Priesterk\u00f6nig.jpeg|Statue of \"Priest King\" wearing a robe; 2400\u20131900 BCE; low fired [[steatite]]; [[National Museum of Pakistan]] ([[Karachi]])\nDidarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg|The [[Didarganj Yakshi]] depicting the ''dhoti wrap''; circa 300 BC; [[Bihar Museum]] (India)\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes; circa 200 BC; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Japan)\nGuptaDanceMusic02.jpg|Ancient form of ''[[Churidar]]'' worn during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]]; circa 300 AD; [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] ([[New Delhi]])\nRaja Ravi Varma - Mahabharata - Shakuntala.jpg|[[Shakuntala]], wife of [[Dushyanta]] and the mother of [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Emperor Bharata]], from [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa|Kalidasa]]'s play ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', wearing a [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]\nBritish Museum silk princess painting.jpg|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid silk worm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan; 7th to 8th century; [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{Main|Clothing in ancient Egypt}}\nEvidence exists for production of linen cloth in [[Ancient Egypt]] in the Neolithic period, c. 5500 BC.

Dutton New Zork, 1989, {{ISBN|0-525-24574-X}}</ref> Hemp fibers were also discovered in the [[Torihama shell mound]], Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the J\u014dmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the J\u014dmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers,  funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. The pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.<ref>Zamanaka, Norio, ''The Book of Kimono'', Kodansha International, 1986, {{ISBN|0-87011-785-8}}</ref>\n\nNext was the Yayoi period, during which rice cultivation was developed. This led to a shift from hunter-gatherer communities to agrarian societies which had a large impact on clothing. According to Chinese literature from that time period, clothing more appropriate to agriculture began to be worn. For example, an unsewn length of fabric wrapped around the body, or a poncho-type garment with a head-hole cut into it. This same literature also indicates that pink or scarlet makeup was worn but also that mannerisms between people of all ages and genders were not very different. However, this is debatable as there were probably cultural prejudices in the Chinese document. There is a common Japanese belief that the Yayoi time period was quite utopian before Chinese influence began to promote the use of clothing to indicate age and gender.\n\nFrom 300 to 550 AD was the Yamato period, and here much of the clothing style can be derived from the artifacts of the time. The tomb statues (haniwa) especially tell us that the clothing style changed from the ones according to the Chinese accounts from the previous age. The statues are usually wearing a two piece outfit that has an upper piece with a front opening and close-cut sleeves with loose trousers for men and a pleated skirt for women. Silk farming had been introduced by the Chinese by this time period but due to silk's cost it would only be used by people of certain classes or ranks.\n\nThe following periods were the Asuka (550 to 646 AD) and Nara (646 to 794 AD) when Japan developed a more unified government and began to use Chinese laws and social rankings. These new laws required people to wear different styles and colors to indicate social status. Clothing became longer and wider in general and sewing methods were more advanced.<ref>Slade, T. (2009).

The basic garments were the Bahag  and the tube skirt\u2014what the Maranao call malong\u2014or a light blanket wrapped around instead. But more prestigious clothes, lihin-lihin, were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions\u2014[[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with [[sleeves]], capes, or ankle-length robes. The textiles of which they were made were similarly varied. In ascending order of value, they were [[abaca]], abaca decorated with colored [[cotton]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[cotton]], cotton decorated with silk thread, silk, imported printstuff, and an elegant abaca woven of selected fibers almost as thin as [[silk]]. In addition, Pigafetta mentioned both G-strings and skirts of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cloth.\n\nUntailored clothes, however had no particular names. ''Pandong'', a lady's [[cloak]], simply meant any natural covering, like the growth on banana trunk's or a natal caul. In [[Panay]], the word ''kurong'', meaning curly hair, was applied to any short skirt or blouse; and some better ones made of imported chintz or calico were simply called by the name of the cloth itself, tabas. So, too, the wraparound skirt the Tagalogs called tapis was hardly considered a skirt at all: Visayans just called it habul (woven stuff) or halong ([[abaca]]) or even hulun ([[sash]]).\n\nThe usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban, though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong\u2014as'' the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy. The most prestigious kind of ''pudong'', limited to the most valiant, was, like their G-strings, made of pinayusan, a gauze-thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness, tie-dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery, and burnished to a silky sheen. Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor: real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness.\nWomen generally wore a kerchief, called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head; but they also had a broad-brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak, woven of sago-palm leaves. Some were evidently signs of rank: when Humabon's queen went to hear mass during Magellan's visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural & History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106060654/http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{Main|Clothing in the ancient world|Clothing in ancient Greece|Clothing in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:ChitonAndHimation.png|thumb|200px|Greek chiton (left) and chiton worn under himation]]\nFabric in Ancient Greece was woven on a warp-weighted loom.

Typical garments were the [[peplos]], a loose robe worn by women; the [[chlamys]], a [[cloak]] worn by men; and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], a tunic worn by both men and women. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. A long cloak called a [[himation]] was worn over the peplos or chlamys.\n\nThe [[toga]] of ancient Rome was also an unsewn length of wool cloth, worn by male citizens draped around the body in various fashions, over a simple [[tunic]]. Early tunics were two simple rectangles joined at the shoulders and sides; later tunics had sewn [[sleeve]]s. Women wore the draped [[stola]] or an ankle-length tunic, with a [[shawl]]-like [[palla (garment)|palla]] as an outer garment. Wool was the preferred fabric, although linen, [[hemp]], and small amounts of expensive imported silk and cotton were also worn.\n\n===Iron Age Europe===\nThe [[Iron Age]] is broadly identified as stretching from the end of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the [[Medieval]] period. Bodies and clothing have been found from this period, preserved by the anaerobic and acidic conditions of [[peat bogs]] in northwestern Europe.

People in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new [[migration period|invading populations]] such as [[Franks]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Visigoths]]. Men of the invading peoples generally wore short [[tunic]]s, with belts, and visible trousers, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] or leggings. The Romanised populations, and the Church, remained faithful to the longer tunics of Roman formal costume.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nThe elite imported silk cloth from the Byzantine, and later Muslim, worlds, and also probably cotton. They also could afford bleached linen and dyed and simply patterned wool woven in Europe itself. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art. Lower classes wore local or homespun wool, often undyed, trimmed with bands of decoration, variously [[embroidery]], [[tablet weaving|tablet-woven]] bands, or colorful borders woven into the fabric in the loom.<ref>[[Gale Owen-Crocker|Owen-Crocker, Gale R.]], ''Dress in Anglo-Saxon England'', revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-84383-081-7}} pp. 309\u2013315</ref><ref name=\"Norse\">\u00d8sterg\u00e5rd, Else, ''Woven into the Earth: Textiles from Norse Greenland'', Aarhus University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|87-7288-935-7}}</ref>\n\n===High middle ages and the rise of fashion===\n{{Main|1100\u20131200 in fashion|1200\u20131300 in fashion|1300\u20131400 in fashion}}\n[[File:ItalianSilkDamask.jpg|left|150px|thumb|14th-century Italian silk damasks]]\nClothing in 12th and 13th century Europe remained very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the subcontinent. The traditional combination of short tunic with hose for working-class men and long tunic with overdress for women and upper class men remained the norm. Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe 13th century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear. Linen was increasingly used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin. Unlike wool, linen could be laundered and bleached in the sun. Cotton, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as [[buckram]] and [[fustian]].\n\n[[Crusades|Crusaders]] returning from the [[Levant]] brought knowledge of its fine textiles, including light silks, to Western Europe.

Even though the purdah was made compulsory for the Mughal women, we see that this did not stop themselves from experimenting in style and attire. Abul Fazal mentions that there were sixteen components that adorned a woman. These not only included clothing but also other aspects like that of oiling the body and iqtar. Mughal women wore long loose jamas with full sleeves and in winters it was accompanied by a Qaba or a Kashmir shawl used as a coat. Women were very fond of their perfumes and scents. Jewellery in the Mughal tradition signified not only religious values but also style statements.\n\n===Pre-Colonial North America===\n{{main|Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nAcross North America, native people constructed clothing using natural fibers such as cotton and agave as well as leather skins from animals such as deer or beavers. When traders and colonists came from Europe, they brought with them sheep and travelers highly valued the beaver pelts in particular for their warmth. Beaver pelt trade was one of the first commercial endeavors of colonial North America and a cause of the [[Beaver Wars]].\n\n==Enlightenment and the Colonial period==\n{{main|1700\u20131750 in fashion|1750\u20131795 in fashion}}\nDuring the 18th century, distinction was made between ''full dress'' worn at Court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress which had all but disappeared by the end of the century. Full dress followed the styles of the French court, where rich silks and elaborate embroidery reigned. Men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] for both full dress and undress; these were now sometimes made of the same fabric and trim, signalling the birth of the three-piece [[suit (clothes)|suit]].\n\nWomen's silhouettes featured small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]] in the 1730s and early 1740s, which were displaced for formal court wear by side hoops or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]] which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the court of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Fashion reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], before new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits and a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of British woollen tailoring following the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFor women's dresses, Indian cottons, especially printed [[chintz]]es, were imported to Europe in large numbers, and towards the end of the period simple white [[muslin]] dresses were in fashion.\n\n==Industrial revolution==\n[[File:Textile machinery at Cambrian Factory, Llanwrtyd (1293828).jpg|thumb|Textile machinery at the Cambrian Factory, [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Wales]] in the 1940s.]]\n[[File:T\u00dc RKA Gaudeamusel L\u00e4tis.JPG|thumb|[[Estonia]]n national clothes are a fine example of change in clothing after the industrial revolution. They changed a lot during 18th and 19th of century with the addition of new types of colors (like [[aniline]] dyes), placement of colors (like lengthwise stripes) and with the addition of new elements (like waistcoats). By the end of the 19th century they went out of use in most of the country (except more remote places as in [[Kihnu]] island) and it was only in mid 20th century when they once again gained popularity and now as a formal clothing.

Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organisation. Clothing production, on the other hand, continued to be made by hand.\n\n[[Sewing machine]]s emerged in the 19th century<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/loom_4.htm Spindel, Loom, and Needle] \u2013 History of the Textile Industry</ref> streamlining clothing production.\n\nTextiles were not only made in factories. Before this, they were made in local and national markets. Dramatic change in transportation throughout the nation is one source that encouraged the use of factories. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. Between 1810 and 1840, the development of a national market prompted manufacturing which tripled the output's worth. This increase in production created a change in industrial methods, such as the use of factories instead of hand made woven materials that families usually made.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. J.

Women went to work in textile factories for a number of reasons. Some women left home to live on their own because of crowding at home; or to save for future marriage portions. The work enabled them to see more of the world, to earn something in anticipation of marriage, and to ease the crowding within the home. They also did it to make money for family back home. The money they sent home was to help out with the trouble some of the farmers were having. They also worked in the millhouses because they could gain a sense of independence and growth as a personal goal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Dublin|title=Transforming women's work: New England lives in the industrial revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTfTKyrIGfgC&pg=PA82|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=August 1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8090-4|pages=82\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==20th-century developments==\n\nThe 20th century is marked by new applications for textiles as well as inventions in synthetic fibers and computerized manufacturing control systems.\n\n===Unions and education===\n\nIn the early 20th century, workers in the clothing and textile industries became [[Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union|unionized]] in the United States.

These properties may be implemented through mechanical solutions, such as different weaving and knitting patterns, by modifications to the fibers, or by finishing (textiles) of the textiles. Since the 1960s, it has been possible to finish textiles to resist stains, flames, wrinkles, and microbial life. Advancement in dye technology allowed for coloring of previously difficult-to-dye natural fibers and synthetic fibers.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\">{{cite book | title = Textiles, 12th edition | author1 = Sara J. Kadolph | author2 = Sara B. Marcketti | publisher = Pearson |date = 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Synthetic fibers===\n\nFollowing the invention of plastics by petroleum and chemical corporations, fibers could now be made synthetically. Advancements in fiber spinning actuators and control systems allow control over fiber diameter and shape, so Synthetic fibers, may be engineered with more precision than natural fibers. Fibers invented between 1930 and 1970 include nylon, PTFE, polyester, Spandex, and Kevlar. Clothing producers soon adopted synthetic fibers, often using blends of different fibers for optimized properties.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\"/> Synthetic fibers can be knit and woven similarly to natural fibers.\n\n===Automation and numeric control===\n\nThe early 20th century continued the advances of the Industrial Revolution. In The procedural loops required for mechanized textile knitting and weaving already used logic were encoded in punch-cards and tapes. Since the machines were already computers, the invention of small-scale electronics and microcontrollers did not immediately change the possible functions of these machines. In the 1960s, existing machines became outfitted with computerized numeric control (CNC) systems, enabling more accurate and efficient actuation. In 1983, Bonas Machine Company Ltd. presented the first computer-controlled, [[Jacquard loom#Electronic Jacquard looms|electronic, Jacquard loom]].<ref>[https://www.bonas.be/en/about-us Bonas.co.uk]</ref> In 1988, the first US patent was awarded for a \"pick and place\" robot.<ref>{{cite patent | country=US | number=4872258A| pubdate=1988-09-22 | inventor=Philip A Ragard | url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4872258A/en}}</ref> Advancements such as these changed the nature of work for machine operators, introducing computer literacy as a skill alongside machine literacy.

A precociously intelligent young man, he continued to pursue his interest in literature and storytelling, occasionally contributing to the [[BBC]]'s ''African Writers' Club'' radio show and even dabbling as an actor in London, appearing in a stage version of ''Waiting for Wanda'' in the early 1960s<ref name=\"British Library\">http://sounds.bl.uk/File.aspx?item=024M-C0134X0339XX-0300V0.xml</ref> before it was produced for TV by the BBC.\n\nParkes also worked as a speech writer for [[Kwame Nkrumah]], Ghana's first president, and later worked at NAFTI (Ghana's Film and Television Institute). Parkes was later president of the Ghana Society of Writers and in the 1970s he worked for the Ghanaian Ministry of Information in Accra. In 1967 he wrote and presented the BBC radio portrait of the American poet [[Langston Hughes]], who had been instrumental in Parkes' rise to recognition outside of Ghana. Parkes worked in film for much of his later life. He died in Accra in May 2004.<ref>[[List of African writers (by country)#Ghana|List of African writers by country]]</ref>\n\n===Family===\nFrank Kobina Parkes was part of - and possibly the pioneer of - a Ghanaian artistic dynasty: the well-known Ghanaian broadcaster and novelist [[Cameron Duodu]] was his brother-in-law, and his younger brother Jerry Parkes (also a broadcaster as well as a scientist) was the father of contemporary Ghanaian writer, social commentator and scientist [[Nii Ayikwei Parkes]]. Another nephew, Sam Yarney, is the author of a series of Christian thriller novels, and one of Parkes' sons, also named Frank, is a gospel musician.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''An African Treasury'' (anthology, ed.
