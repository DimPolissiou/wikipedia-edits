Wyatt also explored her thoughts on the atheist arguments of [[Richard Dawkins]] concerning religion.  Rabbi Morris explained she feels his arguments focus too much on disputing the literalist interpretation of scriptures as emphasized by religious fundamentalists. Fundamentalism is only espoused by very extremist groups of religious people, and the vast majority of people of faith do not necessarily take such a literalist view of Scripture.  Dawkins, in her opinion, fails to address the wider social, emotional, spiritual and cultural benefits for human beings who are devoted to their religious beliefs.

She was Rabbi of [[South West Essex and Settlement Reform Synagogue]] in [[London]] from 2012 until 2014.\n\nMorris was born in Canada where she studied and qualified in Law before choosing to study for the rabbinate in London, qualifying in 2002.\n\n==Career==\n\nMorris gained an MA in Jewish History from [[McGill University]] in 1989 before continuing her studies to gain an LLB, also at McGill University, before completing her [[Articled clerk|articles]] at [[Blake, Cassels & Graydon]] in Toronto.\n\nIn 1997, she decided upon a career change and left Canada to study rabbinics at [[Leo Baeck College]] in London, graduating in 2002.\n\nIn the final year of rabbinic studies, she returned to Canada where she served as Rabbi at Har Tikvah, in [[Brampton, Ontario]] and Temple Shalom, in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]/[[Waterloo, Ontario]] from 2001 till 2003.\n\nShe became the first female Rabbi in Scotland when she was appointed to the post of Rabbi of Glasgow Reform Synagogue in October 2003.  During her tenure, Rabbi Morris was also a Guest Lecturer at the [[University of Glasgow]] where she lectured on [[Judaism]].\n\nIn January 2012, Rabbi Morris returned to her native Canada to take on a temporary post of Rabbi at [[Temple B'nai Tikvah]] in [[Calgary]].\n\nIn June 2012, South West Essex and Settlement Reform Synagogue (often referred to by the [[acronym]] SWESRS) in London announced that Rabbi Morris had been appointed as their new Rabbi.<ref name = \"Appointment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.swesrs.org.uk|title=SWESRS website home page, retrieved 18 June 2012|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> She began this position in September 2012<ref name= \"Ilford\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfordrecorder.co.uk/news/news/scotland_s_first_female_rabbi_takes_up_position_at_newbury_park_synagogue_1_1525393|title=''Ilford Recorder'' article announcing appointment of Rabbi Morris.|work=Ilford Recorder|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> and held the role until 2014, when she and her husband returned to Toronto.<ref name=\"Farewell\">{{cite web|url=http://news.reformjudaism.org.uk/press-releases/synagogue-bids-farewell-to-rabbi-nancy-morris.html |title=Synagogue bids farewell to Rabbi Nancy Morris |publisher=[[Movement for Reform Judaism]] |work=News and press |date=16 January 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129162136/http://news.reformjudaism.org.uk/press-releases/synagogue-bids-farewell-to-rabbi-nancy-morris.html |archivedate=29 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Role within Jewish community==\n\nRabbi Morris strongly supports the egalitarian nature of Progressive Judaism and has spoken a number of times on issues relating to gender equality within Judaism.

This family connection partly influenced Rabbi Morris to take up the post at SWESRS as the synagogue has a strong connection with the East End.  In an amazing coincidence, when researching her family history, Rabbi Morris discovered she was also related to Second Lieutenant [[Harry Jassby]], a World War I RAF pilot who was killed on 6 November 1918 at an airfield very close to the Oaks Lane location of SWESRS.  Despite being Jewish, Second Lieutenant Jassby was buried in the Christian cemetery at St.Peters church which was the closest graveyard to the airfield where he was killed.

Wyatt also explored her thoughts on the atheist arguments of [[Richard Dawkins]] concerning religion.  Rabbi Morris explained she feels his arguments focus too much on disputing the literalist interpretation of scriptures as emphasized by religious fundamentalists. Fundamentalism is only espoused by very extremist groups of religious people, and the vast majority of people of faith do not necessarily take such a literalist view of Scripture.  Dawkins, in her opinion, fails to address the wider social, emotional, spiritual and cultural benefits for human beings who are devoted to their religious beliefs. Rabbi Morris particularly loves the discussion and lively debate that forms such an important part of Jewish tradition and understanding of Judaism throughout its history.<ref>BBC Essex Ian Wyatt programme \u2013 broadcast Sunday 16 December 2012 (no longer available for download from the BBC site)</ref>\n\nRabbi Morris appeared regularly on [[BBC Radio Scotland]]'s ''Thought For The Day'' slot where she presented, from a [[Jewish]] perspective, brief talks designed to cause listeners to pause for reflection.\n\nRabbi Morris also contributed to the BBC radio programme on [[Matisyahu]] with her predecessor at Glasgow Reform Synagogue, Rabbi [[Pete Tobias]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2007/10/12/matisyahu_faith_feature.shtml|title=BBC Listen Again page on Matisyahu programme|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\nRabbi Morris studied in Vienna for a year while she wrote her Master's Thesis on the subject of [[Ludwig August von Frankl|Ludwig Frankl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=59809&local_base=GEN01-MCG02|title=Rabbi Nancy Morris' Master's Thesis on McGill University theses library|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> It is available to view on the [[McGill University]] website.\n\nRabbi Morris contributed to the book ''[[God, Doubt and Dawkins]]'', a Reform response to [[Richard Dawkins]]' book ''[[The God Delusion]]''.\n\nShe also publishes selected Torah commentary and articles on her own website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinancymorris.com|title=Rabbi Nancy Morris|accessdate=29 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507170133/http://www.rabbinancymorris.com/|archive-date=2013-05-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_/ai_n12585041 The ''Sunday Herald'' interview of Rabbi Morris upon her appointment at Glasgow New Synagogue, dated 14 December 2003]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Reform Judaism in the United Kingdom}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morris, Nancy}}\n\n[[Category:1961 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Women rabbis]]\n[[Category:Canadian Reform rabbis]]\n[[Category:21st-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:British Reform rabbis]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Leo Baeck College]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:McGill University Faculty of Law alumni]]\n[[Category:Scottish Jews]]\n", "name_user": "Headhitter", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Reordered cats", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Morris"}
