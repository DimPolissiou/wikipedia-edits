Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these \"disguised restrictions on trade\" by, for instance, \"basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long.

Equally problematic, the model is not designed to assess the effect on trade from trade agreements \u2013 in fact, the model is profoundly ill suited for such an exercise. No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade. The reason is simple: if a model cannot predict the effects on the flows and profile of trade as a consequence of trade liberalisation, it is of no use at all.\"<ref name=\":30\"/> They add, \"In Capaldo\u2019s analysis, structural change and the emergence of new industries do not play a role at all. Capaldo implicitly assumes that an economy with its labour and capital does not respond and adjust to new circumstances. New competition only leads to new unemployment.

Busch and [[McGill University]] Professor Krzysztof J. Pelc note that modern trade deals are long and complex because they often tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]], such as different standards and regulations, in addition to [[tariff]]s. Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these \"disguised restrictions on trade\" by, for instance, \"basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long.

The two cities are collectively referred to as the ''Twin Capitals''. Cuttack is famous for its unique silver [[filigree]] works (''[[Tarakasi]]''), and woven textiles and horn works. It is famous for its [[Vijayadashami|Dussehra]] celebrations across [[India]] only after [[Kolkata]].

Apart from Mahanadi, four of its distributaries also run through the city. The distributaries include Mahanadi, Kathajodi, Kuakhai and Birupa where Kathajodi further has two distributaries; the right being Devi while the left is Biluakhai. Mahanadi runs through the city on the northern side separating the main city from the Jagatpur Industrial Area. The Kathajodi river forms a riverine island of Bayalis Mouza (42 Wards) after separating the main city from Gopalpur. The Kuakhai river separates the southern part of the city into two-halves, namely Pratap Nagri and the new township of Naranpur. The Kuakhai runs throughout the south of the city along Phulnakhara before entering Bhubaneswar. The Birupa river runs through the north of Jagatpur Industrial Area separating it from Choudwar. There are numerous ponds known as (''pokharis'') in the city that store rain water. The Mahanadi provides much of the drinking water to the city. Recent growth of the city has resulted in expansion across the [[Kathajodi River]] and a newer township towards the head of the delta formed between the tributary Kathajodi river and the main river Mahanadi has come up by the name of Markat Nagar (popularly known as CDA by the local residents) which is spread across 2000 acres.

Spread across a vast patch of forest land on the outskirts of the city, the place was infested by tigers, panthers, snakes and other wildlife. The forest was cleared except for some ancient trees, which are still standing tall. The domed structures were solidly built with local materials. Kiln baked bricks and lime mortar was used. There were big wells in the compound and underground cells. Separate stables for their horses and elephants, magazines for storing gunpowder, living quarters etc. were made. The barracks housed the artillery, cavalry and infantry forces. The Marathas had as many as 2,000 soldiers in the barracks. There was a thick wall around with watchtowers, none of which now exist.\n\n=== Salt House ===\nBritishers had built the Salt House in 1847\u201348 and the Collectorate was functioned from this house till new building was built. River 'Kathajodi' was the main transit source for the commercial commodities. The length of the buildings is 190' with 66 pillars. Presently the building is used as Courts of Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrates. The building had an aristocratic look with 3 guns standing as guards. Unfortunately, the architecture of the building has been completely disfigured with many brickworks and structures.\n\n=== Lal Bagh Palace ===\nSituated on the bank of the [[Kathajodi River|Kathjodi]], the Lal Bagh Palace at Cuttack has a long and colourful history. This building witnessed the rise and fall of several rulers who controlled the fortune of Odisha. It was constructed by the Mughal Subedar stationed at Cuttack. Subsequently, the property passed into the hands of the Marathas. Over the years the premises have undergone several alterations and modifications. [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Bruton]] visited Cuttack in 1633, when the Lal Bagh Palace was under construction. In 1741, Saulat Jung, the Naib Nazim, fixed his residence in the palace. The building was occupied by the Naib Nazims till 1751 and by the representatives of the [[Bhonsle|Bhonslas]] of Nagpur from 1751 to 1803. Lal Bagh came into the possession of the British in 1803 when Colonel Harcourt's men defeated the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] soldiers. The Lal Bagh Palace was apparently leased out but again came into the possession of Government, who sold it in January 1862, and the purchaser sold the estate along with the building to the East India Irrigation Company. In 1863, the building came into the possession of the Government when they took over the irrigation works from the Company. Since 1868 the building was occupied by Commissioners and sometimes by Collectors. In 1896, Shri R.C. Dutt, the then Commissioner, who was also a well-known historian, lived in this building. In a letter to his daughter, he describes the building as \"the best-situated Commissioner\u2019s house.\" The building which was still under the Irrigation Branch was transferred to the Buildings and Roads Branch of the Government in 1914. In 1941, Shri K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo, Maharaja of Parlakimedi and [[Prime Minister of Orissa|Premier of Orissa]], fixed his residence at the Lal Bagh palace for a time. On 18 July 1942, the Lal Bagh Palace became the new Government House. Sir Hawthorne Lewis was the first Governor to live in the Lal Bagh Palace. This historic building, which stood witness to countless political and social upheavals during [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[British Raj|British]] rule in Odisha, became the center of administration. The Lal Bagh Palace continued to serve as the residence of the Governor till 1960. During the tenure of Shri Sukthankar in 1960, the [[Raj Bhavan (Odisha)|Raj Bhavan]] was shifted from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar. Shri Sukthankar generously donated the building to the [[Indian Red Cross Society]] to utilize it as a children's hospital. The Government of Orissa [now, Odisha] took over this hospital in 1966 and made it an independent institute for post-graduate training and research. At present, the institute is known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Pediatrics, and is popularly known as Shishu Bhavan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rajbhavanodisha.gov.in/history.asp|title=Rajbhavan Odisha : History|website=www.rajbhavanodisha.gov.in|language=EN|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Kanika Rajbati ===\nIt is a palace built by Raja Bahadur Rajendra Narayan Bhanjdeo in Cuttack.

The presence of the English officials and their families had become significant after the occupation of Cuttack in 1803. The site already had graves of a few Englishmen before it was walled in and designated as a graveyard. Initially it was a cemetery for all Christians, but later on it was used only by the Baptists.\n\n=== Shree Gopal Krishna Goshala ===\nThe antiquity of this old complex is not exactly known. Old timers of Cuttack call it the [[Goshala]], but it was originally a Dharamshala for the pilgrims of the old Jagannath Sadak. Just 100 metres from the Nayabazar Chhak, on the far end of the City, it lay right by the side of the old road. This stretch of the Jagannath Sadak, from the Mahanadi till the Kathjori Ghat was once a 100 feet wide road. During the monsoons, when the Mahanadi was often in spate, pilgrims often had to camp for days to make the crossing; the Dharamshala was built well away from the flood plain, right between the two rivers. The place was originally set up as a Dharamshala by one ''Seth Jagannath Halan'' of Calcutta. It was a huge complex with rooms and halls for the pilgrims. There was a big tank and wells dug inside the complex and a large pond, which still exists. It was the largest Dharamshala of the old road and could house a thousand pilgrims. There was a separate accommodation block for the ''Sadhus'' and ''Mahants'' who traveled on the old road. Many of the pilgrims camped under the huge trees. In 1905, two benevolent Marwaris of Salkia in Howrah District, ''Seth Bishen Dayal'' and ''Seth Hari Dayal'', took over the abandoned Dharamshala and transformed it into a Goshala. There is a marble plaque which says that the ''Victoria Gorakhini Sabha'' opened the Goshala in the place in 1905. They made some alterations and repairs to the old building and made it into a charitable institution rendering service for old and infirm cattle.\n[[File:Ratnagiri-(18).jpg|thumb|305x305px|Lalitgiri as a part of Pushpagiri Mahavihara]]\n\n=== Lalitgiri ===\nLalitgiri also known as '''Naltigiri''' is a major [[Buddhist]] [[Mahavihara]] complex in the Indian [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Odisha]] comprising major [[stupa]]s, 'esoteric' Buddha images, and monasteries ([[vihara]]s), one of the oldest sites in the region.

The hill is dotted with temples, among which the temple of Goddess Olasuni, the presiding deity and the tomb of Saint Arakhit Das are famous. The sleepy Olasuni hill wakes up to the delight of the devotees, on ''Magha Ekadasi'' every year, who throng the place in large numbers to witness the nine-day Gumpha Yatra.

The Lal Bagh Palace was apparently leased out but again came into the possession of Government, who sold it in January 1862, and the purchaser sold the estate along with the building to the East India Irrigation Company. In 1863, the building came into the possession of the Government when they took over the irrigation works from the Company.

This stretch of the Jagannath Sadak, from the Mahanadi till the Kathjori Ghat was once a 100 feet wide road. During the monsoons, when the Mahanadi was often in spate, pilgrims often had to camp for days to make the crossing; the Dharamshala was built well away from the flood plain, right between the two rivers. The place was originally set up as a Dharamshala by one ''Seth Jagannath Halan'' of Calcutta. It was a huge complex with rooms and halls for the pilgrims. There was a big tank and wells dug inside the complex and a large pond, which still exists. It was the largest Dharamshala of the old road and could house a thousand pilgrims.

Since then it has been more than one and half decade now and the flock has been raised to 48. Without any Govt support, Behera had been taking care all of these birds till his death thereby earning the name \"Peacock man\". A few local youngsters took over the charges of present-day peacock herd of 150 hens and cocks.\n\n==== Mahanadi River Boating ====\nJetty has been constructed on Mahanadi near Jobra to facilitate tourists for river cruise ride to Dhabaleshwar or motor boating on Mahanadi. NCC has an exclusive jetty for naval cadet training.\n\n=== Lakes and reservoirs ===\n\n[[File:Deojhar or Dian Dui Dhar Waterfall.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Anshupa Lake, Cuttack.jpg|thumb|342x342px|Anshupa Lake]]\n\n==== Deojhar WaterFalls, Narasinghpur, Cuttack ====\nConsidered as the one & only waterfall in the entire district this waterfall is around 100&nbsp;km from Cuttack's main city & can be reached Via Athagada & Badamba.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==== Anshupa Lake ====\n[[Anshupa Lake|Anshupa lake]] is a 141-hectare horseshoe-shaped [[fresh water]] lake on the left bank of the [[Mahanadi river]]. It is 40&nbsp;km from the city and acts as a shelter for the migratory birds in the wintry weather season. This small lake holds a prominent position in the tourist map of Odisha for its natural environment and proximity to both Cuttack and [[Bhubaneswar]]. Some bamboo cottages are made on the top of Saranda hill for tourist refreshments. Boating facilities are available.\n\n==== Jobra Reservoir ====\nJobra [[Barrage (dam)|Barrage]] or Jobra Anikut as widely called is a major source of water for the Mahanadi delta region. Taladanda canal, a major irrigation and flood canal in coastal area starts from here. [[Indian Oil Corporation|IOCL]]'s [[Paradip Refinery]] has its water intake point from this barrage. The barrage is a very picturesque spot for watching sunsets and thus attracts locals.\n\n==== Naraj and Mundali Reservoirs ====\nSituated at the bifurcation point of [[Mahanadi]] and [[Kathajodi River|Kathajodi]] rivers, it marks the westernmost tip of Cuttack city. It is a major [[Dam|irrigation dam]] on Kathajodi river that ensures the water level in Mahanadi river and thereby preventing flood situations in Cuttack. Near to the Naraj Barrage is the Mundali barrage that is the starting point of Puri Canal. Naraj is a major railway station apart from [[Cuttack Junction railway station|Cuttack railway station]]. The area surrounding Naraj has many industries.\n\n==== Stone revetment on Mahanadi ====\nIdea of Embankment and fund contribution given by Cuttack Raksaka Baimundi to Maharaja Markata Keshari to save Cuttack from Flood.

It is the fourth-largest city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and, together with [[Greifswald]], Stralsund forms an ''Oberzentrum'', one of four high-level [[List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|urban centers of the region]].\n\nStralsund was granted city rights in 1234 and was one of the most prospering members of the medieval Hanseatic League. In 1628, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Stralsund came under [[Siege of Stralsund (1628)|Swedish]] rule and remained so until the upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the 19th century it became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Germany. Since 2002, Stralsund's old town with its rich heritage is honored as a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Heritage]], along with [[Wismar]] in [[Mecklenburg]].\n\nThe main industries of Stralsund are [[shipyard]]s, fishing, [[mechanical engineering]], and, to an increasing degree, [[Tourism in Germany|tourism]], [[life sciences]], services and [[high tech]] industries, especially [[information technology]] and [[biotechnology]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Stralsund, Altstadt (2011-05-21) 4.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Stralsund and its [[World heritage site|world heritage]] [[Altstadt|old town]] island]]\n\n=== Location ===\nThe town of Stralsund is located in northeastern [[Germany]] in the region of [[Western Pomerania]] in the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:STRALSUND nieder.svg|thumb|upright|left|Precipitation diagram]]\nIts [[precipitation (meteorology)|annual precipitation]] is 656&nbsp;mm (25.8 inches) and comparatively low, falling within the lowest third of all precipitation values in Germany. The driest month is February; the most precipitation falls in July. The precipitation varies relatively moderately throughout the year. Only 40% of weather stations in Germany exhibit lower seasonal variation.\n\n=== Landscapes, hills and rivers ===\n[[File:Stralsund, Germany, R\u00fcgenbr\u00fccke, Pylon und alte Klappbr\u00fccke (2006-09-12).JPG|thumb|right|[[Strelasund Crossing|R\u00fcgen Bridge]], Germany's largest bridge, connects Stralsund with [[R\u00fcgen]] Island]]\n\nThe town lies on the sound of [[Strelasund]], a [[strait]] of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its geographic proximity to the island of [[R\u00fcgen]], whose only fixed link to the mainland, the [[Strelasund Crossing]], runs between Stralsund and the village of [[Altef\u00e4hr]], has given Stralsund the sobriquet \"Gateway to the Island of R\u00fcgen\" (''Tor zur Insel R\u00fcgen''). Stralsund is located close to the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]].\n\nStralsund's town borough includes municipal forest and three municipal ponds (the ''Knieperteich, Frankenteich'' and ''Moorteich''. The three ponds and the Strelasund lend the Old Town, the original settlement site and historic center of the town, a protected island ambience. The highest point of the town is the ''Galgenberg'' (\"Gallows Hill\") on its western approaches.\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe town's territory covers an area of 38.97&nbsp;km\u00b2, which makes Stralsund, with its nearly 58,000 inhabitants one of the most densely populated towns in [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] (1,480 inhabitants per km\u00b2).\n\nThe borough of the Hanseatic town of Stralsund is divided into as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

Merchants from other countries as well as locals were attracted to the area  and made up one third of the town's population. The Danish navy used the isle as well. When the settlement had grown to town size, prince [[Wizlaw I]] of R\u00fcgen granted [[L\u00fcbeck law]] to \"our town Stralow\" in 1234, although a significant settlement had existed long before the formal founding.<ref name=\"heritage\"/> In 1240, when the prince gave additional land to the town, he called it ''Stralesund''.\n\nThe success of the settlement challenged the powerful [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]], which burnt Stralsund down in 1249. Afterwards the town was rebuilt with a massive [[town wall]] having 11 [[town gates]] and 30 watchtowers. The ''Neustadt'', a town-like suburb, had merged with Stralsund by 1361. ''Schadegard'', a nearby twin town to Stralsund also founded by Wizlaw I, though not granted German law, served as the principal stronghold and enclosed a fort. It was given up and torn down by 1269 under pressure from the Stralsund ''[[bourgeoisie|B\u00fcrger]]''.\n\nIn 1293 Stralsund became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref name=EBstral/>  A total of 300 [[Cog (ship)|ships]] flying the flag of Stralsund cruised the [[Baltic Sea]] in the 14th century.

Lost to [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in the [[Battle of Stralsund (1678)]], it reverted to Sweden in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679)]]. In the [[Great Northern War]] in 1715 [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] led the [[Battle of Stralsund (1715)|defence of Stralsund]] for a year against the united European armies. Stralsund remained under Swedish control until the [[Battle of Stralsund (1807)]], when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army occupied it. Seized by [[Ferdinand von Schill]]'s [[freikorps]] in 1809, it [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)|subsequently reverted to French control]], with Schill killed in action. With the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), Stralsund became a part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Province of Pomerania]] and the seat of a [[government region]] resembling the former [[Swedish Pomerania]].\n\nFollowing the [[First World War]] Stralsund suffered the same sort of political unrest and unemployment that afflicted much of Germany. In May 1919 Stralsund workers clashed with police, and martial law was declared.{{by whom|date=July 2016}} In the early 1920s the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD) became the strongest party in Stralsund, but its political fortunes waned rapidly, and in September 1922 it reunited with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD).\n\nIn the national parliamentary election of May 1924, the conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) polled 8,547 votes in Stralsund, the SPD 3,534, the Communists 1,825 and the [[German People's Party]] (DVP) of Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] 1,417. However, in keeping with national trends, [[Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] made rapid gains in the late 1920s, and by the time of the last free national election in July 1932 the Nazis polled twice as many votes in Stralsund as the SPD.\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933\u20131945), Stralsund's military installations expanded, and a naval training base opened on the nearby island of [[D\u00e4nholm]]. In [[World War II]] the city was subjected to repeated Allied bombing. Attacks by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944 killed some 800 Stralsunders and destroyed an estimated 8,000 dwellings. The [[354th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|354th Rifle Division]] of the [[Red Army]] occupied Stralsund on April 28, 1945 \u2013 10 days before the end of the war in Europe. Approximately half its population had fled.\n\nDuring the period of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), Stralsund saw the construction of numerous ''Plattenbau'' prefabricated apartment blocks. Its economic life centered on the now state-owned shipyard, which largely focussed on building ships for the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, the city's historic old town was thoroughly restored, and Communist-era apartment blocks were renovated and upgraded. In 2002 the old towns of Stralsund and [[Wismar]], some 120 km to the west, were listed as [[UNESCO world heritage]] sites. Stralsund's shipyard was privatized, and thereafter specialized in constructing container ships.\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| Part_of     = Historic Centres of Stralsund and [[Wismar]]\n| Image       = Nikolaikirche Rathaus HST.jpg\n| Caption     = Stralsund: Old Market Square with the Town Hall and the Nikolaikirche\n| Criteria    = Cultural: ii, iv\n| ID          = 1067\n| Year        = 2002\n| Area        = 80 ha\n| Buffer_zone = 340 ha\n}}\n\n=== Main sights ===\n* The historic Stralsund old town island is a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|World Heritage Site]]. It features many valuable remnants of the Hanseatic time, [[Brick Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|baroque]], [[Revival architecture|historicist]] and [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] buildings.\n* The heart of the old town is the Old Market Square (''Alter Markt''), with the Gothic Town Hall (13th century). Behind the town hall soars the imposing ''Nikolaikirche'' ([[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicholas' Church]]), built in 1270\u20131360. The square is surrounded by houses from different periods, including the Gothic ''Wulflamhaus'' (a 14th-century patrician house, today a restaurant), and the Baroque ''Commandantenhus'' of 1751, the old headquarters of the Swedish military commander.\n* The ''Jakobikirche'' (Saint James's Church), built in mid-14th century. It was destroyed several times, e.g. by [[Wallenstein]] and in [[World War II]].\n* The ''Marienkirche'' ([[St. Mary's church, Stralsund|Saint Mary's Church]]), built in 1383\u20131473 in [[Gothic style]], is the largest church in Stralsund, and from 1625\u20141647 it was the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#History|world's tallest structure]]. Its octagonal tower (104 meters high) offers a panorama view of Stralsund and the neighboring islands of [[R\u00fcgen]] and [[Hiddensee]].\n[[File:Stralsund, Nikolaikirche, Westportal Detail (2011-02-12) 1.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Portal of the Nikolaikirche]]\n* The ''Johanniskloster'' (Franciscan monastery built in 1254), is one of the oldest buildings in the town.\n* Stralsund is the port of registry for the former German [[Reichsmarine]] Navy Sail Training ship ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|\"Gorch Fock\" 1]]''. It is now a floating museum.\n* The ''Katharinenkloster'' (Monastery of Saint Catherine), mainly built in the 15th century, houses two museums today: Stralsund's ''Museum of Cultural History'' (known for e.g. the ''[[Hiddensee treasure|Gold Jewellery of Hiddensee]]''),<ref>[http://museum.stralsund.de/en/ Museum of Cultural History Stralsund]</ref> and the [[German Oceanographic Museum]], Germany's largest aquarium and oceanographic collection. The ancient [[refectory]] of the monastery is one of the most spectacular Gothic interiors in Germany.\n* Besides the mentioned [[German Oceanographic Museum]] at the Katharinenkloster, Stralsund has other museums dedicated to marine life, including the popular [[Ozeaneum]] that was voted ''[[European Museum of the Year Award|European Museum of the Year]]'' in 2010. There is also a nautical center, the Nautineum, on [[D\u00e4nholm]] island and the ''Marinemuseum D\u00e4nholm'', showcasing the military history of the German Navy, especially the interwar [[Reichsmarine]]. It also hosts one of the last remaining GDR [[Volksmarine]] (People's Navy) torpedo boats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Buildings and monuments ===\n;Old Town (''Altstadt'')\nThe centre of Stralsund has a wealth of historic buildings. Since 1990, large parts of the historic old town have been renovated with private and public capital, and with the support of foundations. As a result of the contempt for historic buildings in [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] many houses were threatened by ruin. The Old Town in particular offers a rich variety of historic buildings, with many former merchants' houses, churches, streets and squares. Of more than 800 listed buildings in Stralsund, more than 500 are designated as individual monuments in the Old Town. In twenty years, from the ''Wende'' (turning point) in 1990 to November 2010, 588 of the more than 1,000 old buildings were completely refurbished, including 363 individual monuments.<ref>''64 H\u00e4user in der Altstadt auf der Missstands-Liste'', in: [[Ostsee-Zeitung]] Stralsund dated  4 November 2010</ref> Because of its historical and architectural significance, in 2002 Stralsund's old town together with the old town of [[Wismar]] were added to entitled the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list]] as the \"Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar\".\n\n[[File:Alter Markt Stralsund.jpg|275px|thumb|Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')]]\n;Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')\nThe ensemble of buildings on the Old Market Square includes the St. Nicholas Church; the Town Hall (''Rathaus''), one of the most important [[secular building]]s of North German [[Brick Gothic]] architecture; the Artushof, the Wulflamhaus, the Commandantenhus, the Gewerkschaftshaus and a new apartment complex. \n;Old Town houses\nThe historic houses with their distinctive gables, often renovated at a high financial cost, dominate the scene in the streets of the Old Town. The former Swedish Government Palace is now home to the town construction department. The Museum of Cultural History Museum in ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'', in one of the most important surviving original houses of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] era, was refurbished with funds from the [[Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz|German Foundation for Monument Conservation]] It offers a guide to understanding the town's history over seven centuries.\n\n;Churches\nThree large [[medieval]] [[Brick Gothic]] buildings \u2013 [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund|St. Mary's Church]], [[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicholas' Church]] and St. James Church, point to the medieval significance of Stralsund. Today St. James' is used purely as a cultural venue, its parish being served now by the Church of the Holy Spirit, which also dates from the 14th century. Two other churches on the Old Market Square and the ''Neuer Markt'' are still used for church services. The tower of St. Mary's on the ''Neuer Markt'' offers a panoramic view over Stralsund and the island of R\u00fcgen. \n;Monasteries\nSt. John's Abbey, (the ''Johanniskloster''), a [[Franciscan]] monastery from 1254, now houses the Stralsund Town Archives. Regular cultural events also take place here, such as open-air theater productions.\n\nThe Gothic abbey of St. Anne and St. Bridget (''Kloster St. Annen und Brigitten'') in ''Schillstrasse'' was established around 1560 from the merger of the abbey of ''St. Anne'' (1480) and the double abbey of ''Mariakron'' (1421).\n\nThe Abbey of St. J\u00fcrgen (''Kloster St. J\u00fcrgen am Strande'') on ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'' was mentioned in 1278 for the first time. It served in the 14th century as an old people's home. In 1743 a new building, the ''Kleines St. J\u00fcrgen Kloster'', was built at ''Kniepertor'' and the site was extended in 1754 to create old people's flats and in 1841 for widow's apartments.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1256, the ''Heilgeistkloster'' is now the Hospital of the Holy Spirit.\n\n[[File:Stralsund, am Hafen (2013-07-11), by Klugschnacker in Wikipedia (39).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Old Port with [[Ozeaneum]], warehouses and historical ships including the ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|Gorch Fock]]'']]\n;Port\nFerries to [[Hiddensee]] and [[Altef\u00e4hr]], as well as harbor tour boats, dock at the port. In the summer months the port is a berthing places for river cruisers. There are several yacht harbors and marinas near the Old Town. Hundreds of yachts and boats tie up along the north mole in summer. Architecturally the pilot station and the harbor warehouse (''Hafenspeicher''), as well as the silhouette of the Old Town, form a unique tableau of different historical eras. The barque and former sailor's training ship, ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|Gorch Fock]]'' is another tourist attraction at the harbor.\n\n== University ==\n[[File:FH-Stralsund Wirtschaft 21.jpg|thumb|University of Applied Sciences Stralsund, Department of Economics]]\n\nThe Fachhochschule Stralsund is a ''University of Applied Sciences''<ref>[http://www.fh-stralsund.de/fh_stralsund/powerslave,id,224,nodeid,.html University of Applied Sciences Stralsund]</ref> with a modern campus, north of the old town at the [[Strelasund]].

It is the fourth-largest city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and, together with [[Greifswald]], Stralsund forms an ''Oberzentrum'', one of four high-level [[List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|urban centers of the region]].\n\nStralsund was granted city rights in 1234 and was one of the most prospering members of the medieval Hanseatic League. In 1628, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Stralsund came under [[Siege of Stralsund (1628)|Swedish]] rule and remained so until the upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the 19th century it became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Germany. Since 2002, Stralsund's old town with its rich heritage is honored as a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Heritage]], along with [[Wismar]] in [[Mecklenburg]].\n\nThe main industries of Stralsund are [[shipyard]]s, fishing, [[mechanical engineering]], and, to an increasing degree, [[Tourism in Germany|tourism]], [[life sciences]], services and [[high tech]] industries, especially [[information technology]] and [[biotechnology]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Stralsund, Altstadt (2011-05-21) 4.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Stralsund and its [[World heritage site|world heritage]] [[Altstadt|old town]] island]]\n\n=== Location ===\nThe town of Stralsund is located in northeastern [[Germany]] in the region of [[Western Pomerania]] in the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:STRALSUND nieder.svg|thumb|upright|left|Precipitation diagram]]\nIts [[precipitation (meteorology)|annual precipitation]] is 656&nbsp;mm (25.8 inches) and comparatively low, falling within the lowest third of all precipitation values in Germany. The driest month is February; the most precipitation falls in July. The precipitation varies relatively moderately throughout the year. Only 40% of weather stations in Germany exhibit lower seasonal variation.\n\n=== Landscapes, hills and rivers ===\n[[File:Stralsund, Germany, R\u00fcgenbr\u00fccke, Pylon und alte Klappbr\u00fccke (2006-09-12).JPG|thumb|right|[[Strelasund Crossing|R\u00fcgen Bridge]], Germany's largest bridge, connects Stralsund with [[R\u00fcgen]] Island]]\n\nThe town lies on the sound of [[Strelasund]], a [[strait]] of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its geographic proximity to the island of [[R\u00fcgen]], whose only fixed link to the mainland, the [[Strelasund Crossing]], runs between Stralsund and the village of [[Altef\u00e4hr]], has given Stralsund the sobriquet \"Gateway to the Island of R\u00fcgen\" (''Tor zur Insel R\u00fcgen''). Stralsund is located close to the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]].\n\nStralsund's town borough includes municipal forest and three municipal ponds (the ''Knieperteich, Frankenteich'' and ''Moorteich''. The three ponds and the Strelasund lend the Old Town, the original settlement site and historic center of the town, a protected island ambience. The highest point of the town is the ''Galgenberg'' (\"Gallows Hill\") on its western approaches.\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe town's territory covers an area of 38.97&nbsp;km\u00b2, which makes Stralsund, with its nearly 58,000 inhabitants one of the most densely populated towns in [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] (1,480 inhabitants per km\u00b2).\n\nThe borough of the Hanseatic town of Stralsund is divided into as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

At that time the [[D\u00e4nholm]] isle and fishing village, both at the site of the latter town, were called ''Strale'' or ''Stralow'', [[Polabian language|Polabian]] for \"arrow\" (this meaning underlies the town's coat of arms, which shows an arrow).

Merchants from other countries as well as locals were attracted to the area  and made up one third of the town's population. The Danish navy used the isle as well. When the settlement had grown to town size, prince [[Wizlaw I]] of R\u00fcgen granted [[L\u00fcbeck law]] to \"our town Stralow\" in 1234, although a significant settlement had existed long before the formal founding.<ref name=\"heritage\"/> In 1240, when the prince gave additional land to the town, he called it ''Stralesund''.\n\nThe success of the settlement challenged the powerful [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]], which burnt Stralsund down in 1249. Afterwards the town was rebuilt with a massive [[town wall]] having 11 [[town gates]] and 30 watchtowers. The ''Neustadt'', a town-like suburb, had merged with Stralsund by 1361. ''Schadegard'', a nearby twin town to Stralsund also founded by Wizlaw I, though not granted German law, served as the principal stronghold and enclosed a fort. It was given up and torn down by 1269 under pressure from the Stralsund ''[[bourgeoisie|B\u00fcrger]]''.\n\nIn 1293 Stralsund became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].<ref name=EBstral/>  A total of 300 [[Cog (ship)|ships]] flying the flag of Stralsund cruised the [[Baltic Sea]] in the 14th century.

Lost to [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in the [[Battle of Stralsund (1678)]], it reverted to Sweden in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679)]]. In the [[Great Northern War]] in 1715 [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] led the [[Battle of Stralsund (1715)|defence of Stralsund]] for a year against the united European armies. Stralsund remained under Swedish control until the [[Battle of Stralsund (1807)]], when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army occupied it. Seized by [[Ferdinand von Schill]]'s [[freikorps]] in 1809, it [[Battle of Stralsund (1809)|subsequently reverted to French control]], with Schill killed in action. With the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), Stralsund became a part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Province of Pomerania]] and the seat of a [[government region]] resembling the former [[Swedish Pomerania]].\n\nFollowing the [[First World War]] Stralsund suffered the same sort of political unrest and unemployment that afflicted much of Germany. In May 1919 Stralsund workers clashed with police, and martial law was declared.{{by whom|date=July 2016}} In the early 1920s the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] (USPD) became the strongest party in Stralsund, but its political fortunes waned rapidly, and in September 1922 it reunited with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD).\n\nIn the national parliamentary election of May 1924, the conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) polled 8,547 votes in Stralsund, the SPD 3,534, the Communists 1,825 and the [[German People's Party]] (DVP) of Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] 1,417. However, in keeping with national trends, [[Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] made rapid gains in the late 1920s, and by the time of the last free national election in July 1932 the Nazis polled twice as many votes in Stralsund as the SPD.\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933\u20131945), Stralsund's military installations expanded, and a naval training base opened on the nearby island of [[D\u00e4nholm]]. In [[World War II]] the city was subjected to repeated Allied bombing. Attacks by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944 killed some 800 Stralsunders and destroyed an estimated 8,000 dwellings. The [[354th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|354th Rifle Division]] of the [[Red Army]] occupied Stralsund on April 28, 1945 \u2013 10 days before the end of the war in Europe. Approximately half its population had fled.\n\nDuring the period of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), Stralsund saw the construction of numerous ''Plattenbau'' prefabricated apartment blocks. Its economic life centered on the now state-owned shipyard, which largely focussed on building ships for the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, the city's historic old town was thoroughly restored, and Communist-era apartment blocks were renovated and upgraded. In 2002 the old towns of Stralsund and [[Wismar]], some 120 km to the west, were listed as [[UNESCO world heritage]] sites. Stralsund's shipyard was privatized, and thereafter specialized in constructing container ships.\n\n== Culture and sights ==\n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| Part_of     = Historic Centres of Stralsund and [[Wismar]]\n| Image       = Nikolaikirche Rathaus HST.jpg\n| Caption     = Stralsund: Old Market Square with the Town Hall and the Nikolaikirche\n| Criteria    = Cultural: ii, iv\n| ID          = 1067\n| Year        = 2002\n| Area        = 80 ha\n| Buffer_zone = 340 ha\n}}\n\n=== Main sights ===\n* The historic Stralsund old town island is a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|World Heritage Site]].

It is now a floating museum.\n* The ''Katharinenkloster'' (Monastery of Saint Catherine), mainly built in the 15th century, houses two museums today: Stralsund's ''Museum of Cultural History'' (known for e.g. the ''[[Hiddensee treasure|Gold Jewellery of Hiddensee]]''),<ref>[http://museum.stralsund.de/en/ Museum of Cultural History Stralsund]</ref> and the [[German Oceanographic Museum]], Germany's largest aquarium and oceanographic collection. The ancient [[refectory]] of the monastery is one of the most spectacular Gothic interiors in Germany.\n* Besides the mentioned [[German Oceanographic Museum]] at the Katharinenkloster, Stralsund has other museums dedicated to marine life, including the popular [[Ozeaneum]] that was voted ''[[European Museum of the Year Award|European Museum of the Year]]'' in 2010. There is also a nautical center, the Nautineum, on [[D\u00e4nholm]] island and the ''Marinemuseum D\u00e4nholm'', showcasing the military history of the German Navy, especially the interwar [[Reichsmarine]]. It also hosts one of the last remaining GDR [[Volksmarine]] (People's Navy) torpedo boats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Buildings and monuments ===\n;Old Town (''Altstadt'')\nThe centre of Stralsund has a wealth of historic buildings. Since 1990, large parts of the historic old town have been renovated with private and public capital, and with the support of foundations. As a result of the contempt for historic buildings in [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] many houses were threatened by ruin. The Old Town in particular offers a rich variety of historic buildings, with many former merchants' houses, churches, streets and squares. Of more than 800 listed buildings in Stralsund, more than 500 are designated as individual monuments in the Old Town. In twenty years, from the ''Wende'' (turning point) in 1990 to November 2010, 588 of the more than 1,000 old buildings were completely refurbished, including 363 individual monuments.<ref>''64 H\u00e4user in der Altstadt auf der Missstands-Liste'', in: [[Ostsee-Zeitung]] Stralsund dated  4 November 2010</ref> Because of its historical and architectural significance, in 2002 Stralsund's old town together with the old town of [[Wismar]] were added to entitled the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list]] as the \"Historic Centres of Stralsund and Wismar\".\n\n[[File:Alter Markt Stralsund.jpg|275px|thumb|Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')]]\n;Old Market Square (''Alter Markt'')\nThe ensemble of buildings on the Old Market Square includes the St. Nicholas Church; the Town Hall (''Rathaus''), one of the most important [[secular building]]s of North German [[Brick Gothic]] architecture; the Artushof, the Wulflamhaus, the Commandantenhus, the Gewerkschaftshaus and a new apartment complex. \n;Old Town houses\nThe historic houses with their distinctive gables, often renovated at a high financial cost, dominate the scene in the streets of the Old Town. The former Swedish Government Palace is now home to the town construction department. The Museum of Cultural History Museum in ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'', in one of the most important surviving original houses of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] era, was refurbished with funds from the [[Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz|German Foundation for Monument Conservation]] It offers a guide to understanding the town's history over seven centuries.\n\n;Churches\nThree large [[medieval]] [[Brick Gothic]] buildings \u2013 [[St. Mary's Church, Stralsund|St. Mary's Church]], [[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicholas' Church]] and St. James Church, point to the medieval significance of Stralsund. Today St. James' is used purely as a cultural venue, its parish being served now by the Church of the Holy Spirit, which also dates from the 14th century. Two other churches on the Old Market Square and the ''Neuer Markt'' are still used for church services. The tower of St. Mary's on the ''Neuer Markt'' offers a panoramic view over Stralsund and the island of R\u00fcgen. \n;Monasteries\nSt. John's Abbey, (the ''Johanniskloster''), a [[Franciscan]] monastery from 1254, now houses the Stralsund Town Archives. Regular cultural events also take place here, such as open-air theater productions.\n\nThe Gothic abbey of St. Anne and St. Bridget (''Kloster St. Annen und Brigitten'') in ''Schillstrasse'' was established around 1560 from the merger of the abbey of ''St. Anne'' (1480) and the double abbey of ''Mariakron'' (1421).\n\nThe Abbey of St. J\u00fcrgen (''Kloster St. J\u00fcrgen am Strande'') on ''M\u00f6nchstrasse'' was mentioned in 1278 for the first time. It served in the 14th century as an old people's home. In 1743 a new building, the ''Kleines St. J\u00fcrgen Kloster'', was built at ''Kniepertor'' and the site was extended in 1754 to create old people's flats and in 1841 for widow's apartments.\n\nFirst mentioned in 1256, the ''Heilgeistkloster'' is now the Hospital of the Holy Spirit.\n\n[[File:Stralsund, am Hafen (2013-07-11), by Klugschnacker in Wikipedia (39).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Old Port with [[Ozeaneum]], warehouses and historical ships including the ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|Gorch Fock]]'']]\n;Port\nFerries to [[Hiddensee]] and [[Altef\u00e4hr]], as well as harbor tour boats, dock at the port. In the summer months the port is a berthing places for river cruisers. There are several yacht harbors and marinas near the Old Town. Hundreds of yachts and boats tie up along the north mole in summer. Architecturally the pilot station and the harbor warehouse (''Hafenspeicher''), as well as the silhouette of the Old Town, form a unique tableau of different historical eras. The barque and former sailor's training ship, ''[[Gorch Fock (1933)|Gorch Fock]]'' is another tourist attraction at the harbor.\n\n== University ==\n[[File:FH-Stralsund Wirtschaft 21.jpg|thumb|University of Applied Sciences Stralsund, Department of Economics]]\n\nThe Fachhochschule Stralsund is a ''University of Applied Sciences''<ref>[http://www.fh-stralsund.de/fh_stralsund/powerslave,id,224,nodeid,.html University of Applied Sciences Stralsund]</ref> with a modern campus, north of the old town at the [[Strelasund]].
