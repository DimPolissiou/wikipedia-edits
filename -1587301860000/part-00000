They are being cited here as evidence of the culture of Judaism and not as evidence of their historicity. Ashkenazi jews are not from the lineage of Shem, but from the lineage of Japheth, and have no biblical right to claim Israel.\n\nThe patriarchs and matriarchs of Israel established the foundation for Israel in three families over three generations. The maternal lines of the three founding families of Israel were essential for the foundation of the Nation of Israel. The Torah and Jewish tradition emphasize the importance of the three patriarchs of Israel: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the four matriarchs of Israel: Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.\n[[File: Hebron001.JPG |thumb|Cave of Machpelah, believed to be the burial place of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah.]]\n[[File: RACHEL%27S_TOMB_IN_BETHLEHEM._%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9D.D21-004.jpg | thumb|The Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem. photo c. 1933]] \n\nSarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah were all family of Abraham. In the Jewish Tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah were as well.<ref>Gen. Rabbati, Vayeze, p. 119; Yalkut Shimoni, Vayetze- Remez 125.</ref> Terah, was the father of Abraham, Nahor and Haran.<ref>Genesis 11:27. The Talmud suggests the possibility that the Torah may be establishing an order of wisdom rather than birth. Sanhedrin 69B</ref> (The Torah lists the son-after-son descendants from Shem, son of Noah, to Terah, the father of Abraham: Arpachshad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Re'u, Serug, Nahor, Terah.)<ref>Genesis 11:10-26</ref> Abraham and Sarah (who in the Jewish Tradition was greater than Abraham in prophecy)<ref> Genesis 21:12, Rashi </ref> migrated as a married couple out of Ur Kasdim (in Mesopotamia) to Haran (in Mesopotamia) and eventually to the land of Canaan.<ref>Genesis 11:31</ref> Sarah came from the same family as Abraham. In the Torah, Abraham refers to Sarah as his sister.<ref>Genesis 20:2. Currently science believes that mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA), a human genome that is exceptionally both circular and distinct from Nuclear DNA, is unique in that it is transmitted exclusively by a mother to both her daughters and sons. (Nuclear DNA in a human consists of 22 pairs of autosomes and two sex chromosomes. The 22 pairs of autosomes are derived half from each parent. The two sex chromosomes, XX in females XY in males, are also derived half from each parent. A female inherits one X from her father and one from her mother. Y-DNA, inherited exclusively by a male from his father, contains fewer genes than an X chromosome because it is shorter and is one of his two sex chromosomes, the other being the X that he inherits from his mother.) The Torah may similarly be suggesting that a brother and sister from the same mother are more closely related than a brother and a sister from just the same father (Genesis 20:12 Rashi).</ref> According to Jewish Tradition, Sarah was Abraham's niece, Iscah (Jessica).<ref> Sanhedrin 69b</ref> (Haran, brother of Abraham, was the father of both [[Milcah]], and Iscah.<ref>Genesis 11:29</ref> There is a Jewish oral tradition that Milcah is the ancestor of all prophets of non-Jewish nations.<ref> Yalkut Shimoni, Balak, 23</ref> Milcah's sons were Uts, Buz, Kemuel, Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel, father of Rebekah. <ref> Genesis 22: 20-23</ref> Milcah had these eight sons with Nahor, brother of Abraham. <ref> Genesis 22: 20, 23</ref>)\n\nBefore fathering Isaac, Abraham had a son, Ishmael, with Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian.<ref>Genesis 16:3,15</ref> After Sarah died, Abraham also had six other sons with a woman named Keturah.<ref>Genesis 25:1,2</ref> Isaac alone came from the maternal line of Sarah. The Torah's story line continues with the life of Isaac. ''The Nation of Israel descends directly from Isaac, child of Sarah'', and not directly from Abraham's son Ishmael, who was born first, nor from any of Abraham's six other sons.<ref>Tanchuma, Hukat, 6: ''shene\u2019emar, v\u2019gam et ben ha\u2019amah''; Genesis 25:6; Genesis 17:19: And God said, \u201c\u2026 for Sarah, your wife, will give birth to a son for you, and you shall name him Isaac, and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.\u201d</ref> \n<blockquote>And God said to Abraham, \"Be not displeased concerning the lad and concerning your handmaid; all that Sarah tells you, hearken to her voice, for through Isaac will your seed be called\u2026.\u201d(Genesis: 21:12) </p></blockquote>\n\nIsaac married Rebekah, who came from the City of Nahor in Aram-Naharaim (in Mesopotamia). <ref>Genesis 24:10</ref> They had Jacob and Esau. Rebekah came from the same family as Abraham. Under duress, Isaac refers to Rebekah as his sister.<ref>Genesis 26:7</ref> Rebekah was Abraham's great niece through his brother, Nahor, and his great-great niece through Milcah, daughter of his brother, Haran.<ref>Genesis 11:29 ; Genesis 22:20-23. Also, Genesis 22:23 Rashi that this whole genealogy was written just for Rebekah.</ref> In the Jewish Tradition, Rebekah was also the great-niece of Sarah.\n\nEsau, Jacob's fraternal twin married two Hittite women, neither from the family of Abraham. <ref>Genesis 26: 34,35</ref> Esau's third wife was from the family of Ishmael.<ref>Genesis 28: 9</ref> Ishmael's mother was Hagar. None of Esau's children are the focus of the story line of the Torah. (Esau was the progenitor of Edom.<ref>Genesis 36: 1, 8, 9, 19, 43</ref> One of the sons of the sons of Esau, son of Isaac, was the chieftain of Amalek.<ref>Genesis 36: 16. The mother of Amalek was Timna, concubine of Eliphaz. Genesis 36: 12. The Horites lived in the land of Seir before Edom migrated there. Genesis 36: 8, 20, 22, 30.</ref>)\n\nIn the text of the Torah, Isaac instructed Jacob, who was to father the twelve tribes, specifically to marry a niece of Rebekah.<ref>Genesis 28:2</ref> Jacob was married to Leah,<ref>Genesis 29:22-26</ref> and then married Rachel.<ref>Genesis 29:28,29</ref> Rachel and Leah lived in Padan-Aram (in Mesopotamia).<ref>Genesis 28:2, Genesis 28:18-30</ref> They were Jacob's first cousins.

In the Jewish Tradition, Rachel and Leah were also the great-great nieces of Sarah. According to Jewish tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah, handmaidens of Rachel and Leah and the birth-mothers of four of the tribes, were Rachel and Leah's half-sisters. They had the same father as Rachel and Leah, but not the same mother.<ref>Gen.

[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Yebamot'' 17a; ''Kiddushin'' 68b); [[Numbers Rabba]] 19:3</ref> The Talmud (''Yebamot'' 17a) then brings down an opinion which said that a child born from an Israelite mother and a non-Jewish father is something of an anomaly worthy of censure, and that the child is a non-Jew, based on a verse in the 5th chapter of Hosea: \u201cThey have betrayed Hashem, for they have begotten strange children.\u201d\n \nAccording to [[Maimonides]] in his Code of Jewish law,<ref>Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]] (Hil.

The attempt to find reasons for the change, however, has proved to be elusive and is quite unnecessary since it can be explained entirely economically by the logic of the law itself and is typical of Rabbinic thinking in general. But the development in the law had already taken place before the redaction of the Mishnah at the very latest. With the exception of the Rabbi in the Jerusalem Talmud (Qiddushin, 3:12) who permitted the child of a gentile mother and Jewish father to be circumcised on the Sabbath and whose opinion was vehemently rejected, the law is accepted unanimously in both Talmuds. It is recorded as the law in all the Codes without dissenting voice and has been the universal norm in all Jewish communities. For such a law to be changed, only the weightiest religious and ethical advantages will suffice and it is difficult indeed to discover any such in the change in this particular instance. To change this particular law would strike at the heart of the whole halakhic process and would involve a theological as well as an halakhic upheaval. And for what? The potential loss is great. The gains, if any, are few and the price is far too high.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Shaye J. D. Cohen]] of Harvard University and formerly a Dean at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, questions the date of origin of matrilineal descent:\n<blockquote>The preexilic portions of the Hebrew Bible are not familiar with the matrilineal principle. Numerous Israelite heroes and kings married foreign women; for example, Judah married a Canaanite, Joseph an Egyptian, Moses a Midianite and an Ethiopian, David a Philistine, and Solomon women of every description. Although Exod. 34:16 and Deut. 7:1-3 prohibit intermarriage only with the Canaanites, a prohibition that was supposed to have originated with the patriarchs Abraham (Gen. 24:3) and Isaac (Gen. 27:46-28:1), some Israelites extended the prohibition to include all foreigners (Judg. 14:3). But it never occurred to anyone in preexilic times to argue that such marriages were null and void. Marriage was the non- sacramental, private acquisition of a woman by a man, and the state had little or no legal standing in the matter. The foreign woman who married an Israelite husband was supposed to leave her gods in her father's house, but even if she did not, it never occurred to anyone to argue that her children were not Israelites. Since the idea of conversion to Judaism did not yet exist, it never occurred to anyone to demand that the foreign woman undergo some ritual to indicate her acceptance of the religion of Israel. The woman was joined to the house of Israel by being joined to her Israelite husband; the act of marriage was functionally equivalent to the later idea of conversion. In some circumstances biblical law and society did pay attention to maternal identity-the children of concubines and female slaves some- times rank lower than the children of wives-but it never occurred to anyone to impose any legal or social disabilities on the children of foreign women.<ref>''The Origins of the Matrilineal Principle in Rabbinic Law'', Shaye J.D. Cohen, AJS Review, V. 10.1, 1985, 19-53</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his review of Cohen's article, Rabbi Jacobs accepts that the law may have changed in the early Tannaitic period (circa 10-70 CE): \"From the historical evidence marshalled by Professor Cohen it would appear that the change from the patrilineal to the matrilineal principle for the offspring of mixed unions of Jew and gentile took place in the early Tannaitic period.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\" />\n\nBut Jacobs dismisses Cohen's suggestion that \"the Tannaim were influenced by the Roman<ref>In Roman law, without ''connubium'', the right to contract a legal marriage according to Roman Law (i.e. where both parties are Roman citizens and where both parties gave consent), the marriage was not a ''justum matrimonium'', a legal Roman marriage and the children from such a union had no legal father and therefore followed the status (i.e. Roman citizenship status) of the mother. Interestingly, \u201c[t]hese restrictions as to marriage were not founded on any enactments; they were a part of that large mass of Roman law which belongs to ''Jus Moribus Constitutum'' [unwritten Roman law].\u201d http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Matrimonium.html</ref> legal system...\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\" /> and contends that \"even if the Rabbis were familiar with the Roman law, they might have reacted to it [instead] by preserving the patrilineal principle, holding fast to their own system.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\" />\n\nInstead, Jacobs offers another explanation. Jacobs believes that an Israelite man who married a non-Israelite woman and had a child, that woman and child were considered not part of the \"family clan\" and therefore were not considered Israelite: \"A child born of a Jewish father and a gentile mother cannot be given the status of the father since the patrilineal principle is stated only with regard to unions within the clan. How can the father who steps out of the clan bestow a clan status on the child whom he sires?\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/>\n\nTherefore, Jacobs hypothesizes:<blockquote>The child of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not a gentile because of the application of any matrilineal principle...He is a child without Jewish parentage since the patrilineal principle cannot operate for a union carried out beyond the limits of the clan. The child is not a gentile because his mother is a gentile but because the only way a child can be born as a Jew is for him to have the Jewishness of his father transmitted to him and this cannot happen where the union is outside of the clan limits. Thus, for the Rabbis there is no switch here from a patrilineal to a matrilineal principle. The patrilineal principle still stands, only it cannot operate in this instance.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/></p></blockquote>\n\nThe Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism conducted a survey of 1,617 members of 27 Conservative congregations in the U.S. and Canada in 1995.<ref>Cohen, Steven M. \u201cChapter 1: Assessing the Vitality of Conservative Judaism in North America: Evidence from a Survey of Synagogue Members\u201d. In Wertheimer, Jack (2000). Jews in the Center: Conservative Synagogues and Their Members. Rutgers University Press, p. 20. Steven M. Cohen who co-conducted this survey (Wertheimer, 5) notes that the sample under represents congregants from certain major metropolitan areas (the New York region being represented by only one congregation and the Toronto and Montreal regions having no representation), over represents socially upscale congregants, and under represents congregants under the age of thirty-five. (Wertheimer, 20)</ref> 69% of respondents to the Ratner Center survey agreed that they would regard personally as a Jew anyone who was raised Jewish\u2014even if their mother was Gentile and their father was Jewish (Wertheimer, 59). In this same survey, 29% of respondents indicated that they attended Jewish religious services twice a month or more and 13% that they engage in the study of a Jewish text once a month or more (Wertheimer, 55-57).\n\n====Conservative Jewish Practices====\nThe [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Movement]] practices matrilineal descent. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative movement to the law of matrilineal descent. Furthermore, the movement stated that any rabbi who accepts the principle of patrilineal descent will be subject to expulsion from the Rabbinical Assembly. Still, the Conservative Movement affirmed that \"sincere Jews by choice\" should be warmly welcomed into the community and that \"sensitivity should be shown to Jews who have intermarried and their families.\" The Conservative movement actively reaches out to intermarried families by offering them opportunities for Jewish growth and enrichment.\n\n===Reform Judaism beliefs and practices===\nIn 1983, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary.org\"/> The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism]] has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.<ref>[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=840313&ct=1051515 Reform Judaism in Israel: Progress and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=840313&ct=1051515 |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref> As well, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din formed in Denver, Colorado to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism was dissolved in 1983, due to that Reform resolution.<ref name=\"Wertheimer, A People Divided\">{{Cite book|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|title=A People Divided: Judaism in Contemporary America|publisher=University Press of New England|year=1997}}</ref> However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing \"that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process.\"<ref name=\"jpost1\">{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Jerry |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/UK-Reform-rabbis-accept-patrilineal-descent-409298 |title=UK Reform rabbis accept patrilineal descent - Diaspora - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-19}}</ref> Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis \"would be able to take local decisions \u2013 ratified by the [[Beit Din]] \u2013 confirming Jewish status.\"<ref name=\"jpost1\"/>\n\nOther movements within the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]] also adopted essentially the same position. These include: [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] in England; Progressive Judaism in Australia; one congregation in Austria; some congregations in Eastern Europe. Note that Reform Judaism in Canada and England adopts a different position, similar to that of Conservative Judaism (though there may be an accelerated conversion process for the children of Jewish fathers).\n\n===Karaite Judaism belief and practices===\nKaraite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. Karraite Judaism does not accept the authoritativeness of the Talmud or Jewish Oral Law.\n\n====Karaite Judaism practices====\nThe majority view in [[Karaite Judaism]] is that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent<ref>[http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml Karaite FAQs]; [http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/current_articles/Giyyur_Conversion.shtml Congregation Or Saddiqim, Giyyur]</ref><ref>[http://www.half-jewish.org/bibleintermarriage.html half-jewish.org/bibleintermarriage.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.half-jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.html half-jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.html]</ref> They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.<ref>[http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml]</ref> Only someone who is patrilineally Jewish (someone whose father's father was Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the ''Mo'e\u1e63et Ha\u1e24akhamim'', or the Karaite Council of Sages based in Israel.\n\n===Reconstructionist Judaism belief and practices===\nReconstructionist Judaism, which values equity and inclusivity, was the first movement to adopt the idea of bilineal descent in 1968.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} According to Reconstructionist Judaism, children of one Jewish parent, of either gender, are considered Jewish if raised as Jews.\n\n===Additional notes===\nThe State of Israel adheres to the Jewish law of matrilineal descent for matters which could affect Israeli family law.<ref>For the re-affirmation of matrilineal descent by the Chief Rabbinical Board of the State of Israel see Elberg, Rabbi S., September, 1984, HaPardes Rabbinical Journal, Hebrew, vol.59, Is.1, p. 21.</ref>\n\nSeven marriage contracts that took place before the 13th century between Karaite and Rabbinic individuals have so far been discovered in the [[Cairo Genizah]].<ref>https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women:\n<blockquote> \nPERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE \u2026Marriages with Rabbanite partners were perfectly legal and commonly practised before the thirteenth century. Medieval Karaism was and saw itself as an integral part of Judaism, and such marriages did not entail any form of \"conversion\" of any of the parties. Seven marriage contracts involving Karaite and Rabbanite individuals have so far been discovered in the Cairo Genizah. These marriage contracts stipulated the mutual tolerance of those practices in which the Karaites and the Rabbanites differed. These specific stipulations concerned differences in dietary law, such as the Rabbanite husband's promise not to bring to their house parts of animals authorized by the Rabbanites but forbidden by the Karaite halakhah (the fat tail, the kidneys, the lobe of the liver, the meat of a pregnant animal). Other stipulations concerned the Karaite restrictions on lighting the Sabbath candles and the promise of Rabbanite husbands not to make love to their Karaite wives during Sabbath and festivals\u2014practices strictly forbidden by Karaite law. Due to the calendrical differences, Karaite and Rabbanite festivals did not coincide, and the marriage contracts always included a clause which guaranteed that both parties would be allowed to observe their festivals on their respective dates. </p></blockquote></ref> In the 12th century, approximately 25,000 Jews lived in Egypt, mostly in Cairo.<ref>https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-cairo/</ref> A percentage of the Jewish community was [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]].<ref>It is not specifically known what percentage of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community was Karaite. As of 1906, it was estimated that there were approximately 12,000 Karaites worldwide with fewer than 2,000 estimated to possibly be in Egypt. http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9211-karaites-and-karaism. Today, there are 11 Karaite synagogues in Israel. See https://www.jweekly.com/1999/12/10/israel-s-30-000-karaites-follow-bible-not-talmud/</ref> [[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] became one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Egypt shortly after his arrival there in 1165 CE. Virtually all Jews in the world at this time including the Egyptian Jewish Community followed matrilineal descent. In fact, Maimonides (1138-1204 CE) himself re-codified the law of matrilineal descent in his compilation of Jewish Law:<blockquote>This is the general rule: The status of an offspring from a gentile man or from a gentile woman is the same as his mother's; we disregard the father.<ref>Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (c. 1170-1180 CE), Laws of Forbidden Relationships, 15:4</ref></p></blockquote> The Egyptian Jewish Karaites, however, followed patrilineal descent.<ref>Yaron, Y., Joe Pessah, and Abraham Qanai. An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice, and Culture. N.p.: Qirqisani Center, 2003. Print.</ref> Still, these same 12th century Egyptian Karaites forbade marriage with non-Jews<ref>https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women <blockquote> \nPERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE \nIn order to contract marriage, the parties must be \"marriageable,\" that is: the partners must be Jewish, the woman must be unmarried, and the parties should not fall into any of the kinship categories prohibited by Karaite law. \n1. The parties' religious affiliation \nMarriages with non-Jewish partners are not acceptable for Karaites...</p></blockquote></ref> and also did not allow converts into their community.<ref>This ban was recently lifted by the Karaite Council of Sages.</ref> In effect then, 12th century Egyptian Karaites required that ''both'' parents be Jewish, but they referred to this requirement as patrilineal descent. Marriages between Karaites and the Rabbinic community came to a halt in the thirteenth century when Maimonides ruled for a specific serious reason that there was a problem with them.<ref>https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women. In the 13th century Maimonides ruled that they fell under the classification of ''mamzerut''.\nhttps://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women: \n<blockquote> \nMarriages between Karaite and Rabbanite partners came to a halt when Moses MAIMONIDES (Rambam, 1138\u20131204) argued that while the Karaite marriage itself was binding, their bill of divorce was invalid (probably because of its formulation in Hebrew). Since the children issued from the second union of a Karaite divorc\u00e9e would be illegitimate (mamzerim), and since it was not always possible to ascertain that a divorce had not occurred &#91;sic&#93; in previous generations in a Karaite family, Maimonides decided to consider all Karaites as potential mamzerim, and therefore prohibited for marriage. </blockquote></ref> This specific ruling by Maimonides also means that Maimonides considered the Karaites of 800 yrs ago of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community to be Jewish on their mother's side as well.\n\n==Additional reference from Jewish Scripture==\nSamson, from the tribe of Dan served as Judge of Israel for twenty years.<ref>Judges 13:25, 15:20</ref> According to current scholarship, the most recent likely date for the authorship of the Book of Judges is approximately 500 BCE.<ref>http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9051-judges-book-of : \u201cHence the compilation of the stories of the five Great Judges must be dated soon after the division of the kingdom. Single passages\u2026 may be much older. The editor who combined his own additions with the book containing the stories, producing thereby the earlier Book of Judges, probably wrote in the last decades of the kingdom of Israel. The Deuteronomistic edition was undertaken during the Exile at which time the other additions were probably also incorporated\u2026.\u201d</ref> The reaction of Samson's parents to his desired marriage to a Philistine woman may indicate the cultural expectations in Israel regarding marriage at this time:<blockquote> And his father and his mother said to him, \u201cIs there no woman among the daughters of your brothers and among all of my people that you should go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?\u201d\u2026 <ref>Judges 14:3</ref></p></blockquote>In the account of the Book of Judges, Samson married this woman and soon killed thirty Philistine men in Ashkelon.<ref>Judges 14</ref> (Samson's wife was then given to another man by her father who said that Samson utterly hated her.<ref>Judges 15: 2</ref> Samson then set the fields of the Philistines on fire.<ref>Judges 15:3-5</ref> The Philistines then went and killed this woman and her father.<ref>Judges 15: 6</ref>)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Who is a Jew?]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*Immanuel Jakobovits, \u201cThe Timely and the Timeless\u201d, London 1977, pp. 199-203,[https://www.worldcat.org/title/timely-and-the-timeless-jews-judaism-and-society-in-a-storm-tossed-decade/oclc/3584417]\n*[[Judith Olszowy-Schlanger]], [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women \"Karaite Women: Permissibility of Marriage\"]\n*[https://louisjacobs.org/articles/there-is-no-problem-of-descent/ Louis Jacobs, \"There is No Problem of Descent\"]\n*Professor [[Shaye J.

They are being cited here as evidence of the culture of Judaism and not as evidence of their historicity.\n\nThe patriarchs and matriarchs of Israel established the foundation for Israel in three families over three generations. The maternal lines of the three founding families of Israel were essential for the foundation of the Nation of Israel. The Torah and Jewish tradition emphasize the importance of the three patriarchs of Israel: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the four matriarchs of Israel: Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.\n[[File: Hebron001.JPG |thumb|Cave of Machpelah, believed to be the burial place of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah.]]\n[[File: RACHEL%27S_TOMB_IN_BETHLEHEM._%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9D.D21-004.jpg | thumb|The Tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem. photo c. 1933]] \n\nSarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah were all family of Abraham. In the Jewish Tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah were as well.<ref>Gen. Rabbati, Vayeze, p. 119; Yalkut Shimoni, Vayetze- Remez 125.</ref> Terah, was the father of Abraham, Nahor and Haran.<ref>Genesis 11:27. The Talmud suggests the possibility that the Torah may be establishing an order of wisdom rather than birth. Sanhedrin 69B</ref> (The Torah lists the son-after-son descendants from Shem, son of Noah, to Terah, the father of Abraham: Arpachshad, Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Re'u, Serug, Nahor, Terah.)<ref>Genesis 11:10-26</ref> Abraham and Sarah (who in the Jewish Tradition was greater than Abraham in prophecy)<ref> Genesis 21:12, Rashi </ref> migrated as a married couple out of Ur Kasdim (in Mesopotamia) to Haran (in Mesopotamia) and eventually to the land of Canaan.<ref>Genesis 11:31</ref> Sarah came from the same family as Abraham. In the Torah, Abraham refers to Sarah as his sister.<ref>Genesis 20:2. Currently science believes that mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA), a human genome that is exceptionally both circular and distinct from Nuclear DNA, is unique in that it is transmitted exclusively by a mother to both her daughters and sons. (Nuclear DNA in a human consists of 22 pairs of autosomes and two sex chromosomes. The 22 pairs of autosomes are derived half from each parent. The two sex chromosomes, XX in females XY in males, are also derived half from each parent. A female inherits one X from her father and one from her mother. Y-DNA, inherited exclusively by a male from his father, contains fewer genes than an X chromosome because it is shorter and is one of his two sex chromosomes, the other being the X that he inherits from his mother.) The Torah may similarly be suggesting that a brother and sister from the same mother are more closely related than a brother and a sister from just the same father (Genesis 20:12 Rashi).</ref> According to Jewish Tradition, Sarah was Abraham's niece, Iscah (Jessica).<ref> Sanhedrin 69b</ref> (Haran, brother of Abraham, was the father of both [[Milcah]], and Iscah.<ref>Genesis 11:29</ref> There is a Jewish oral tradition that Milcah is the ancestor of all prophets of non-Jewish nations.<ref> Yalkut Shimoni, Balak, 23</ref> Milcah's sons were Uts, Buz, Kemuel, Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel, father of Rebekah. <ref> Genesis 22: 20-23</ref> Milcah had these eight sons with Nahor, brother of Abraham. <ref> Genesis 22: 20, 23</ref>)\n\nBefore fathering Isaac, Abraham had a son, Ishmael, with Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian.<ref>Genesis 16:3,15</ref> After Sarah died, Abraham also had six other sons with a woman named Keturah.<ref>Genesis 25:1,2</ref> Isaac alone came from the maternal line of Sarah. The Torah's story line continues with the life of Isaac. ''The Nation of Israel descends directly from Isaac, child of Sarah'', and not directly from Abraham's son Ishmael, who was born first, nor from any of Abraham's six other sons.<ref>Tanchuma, Hukat, 6: ''shene\u2019emar, v\u2019gam et ben ha\u2019amah''; Genesis 25:6; Genesis 17:19: And God said, \u201c\u2026 for Sarah, your wife, will give birth to a son for you, and you shall name him Isaac, and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.\u201d</ref> \n<blockquote>And God said to Abraham, \"Be not displeased concerning the lad and concerning your handmaid; all that Sarah tells you, hearken to her voice, for through Isaac will your seed be called\u2026.\u201d(Genesis: 21:12) </p></blockquote>\n\nIsaac married Rebekah, who came from the City of Nahor in Aram-Naharaim (in Mesopotamia). <ref>Genesis 24:10</ref> They had Jacob and Esau. Rebekah came from the same family as Abraham. Under duress, Isaac refers to Rebekah as his sister.<ref>Genesis 26:7</ref> Rebekah was Abraham's great niece through his brother, Nahor, and his great-great niece through Milcah, daughter of his brother, Haran.<ref>Genesis 11:29 ; Genesis 22:20-23. Also, Genesis 22:23 Rashi that this whole genealogy was written just for Rebekah.</ref> In the Jewish Tradition, Rebekah was also the great-niece of Sarah.\n\nEsau, Jacob's fraternal twin married two Hittite women, neither from the family of Abraham. <ref>Genesis 26: 34,35</ref> Esau's third wife was from the family of Ishmael.<ref>Genesis 28: 9</ref> Ishmael's mother was Hagar. None of Esau's children are the focus of the story line of the Torah. (Esau was the progenitor of Edom.<ref>Genesis 36: 1, 8, 9, 19, 43</ref> One of the sons of the sons of Esau, son of Isaac, was the chieftain of Amalek.<ref>Genesis 36: 16. The mother of Amalek was Timna, concubine of Eliphaz. Genesis 36: 12. The Horites lived in the land of Seir before Edom migrated there. Genesis 36: 8, 20, 22, 30.</ref>)\n\nIn the text of the Torah, Isaac instructed Jacob, who was to father the twelve tribes, specifically to marry a niece of Rebekah.<ref>Genesis 28:2</ref> Jacob was married to Leah,<ref>Genesis 29:22-26</ref> and then married Rachel.<ref>Genesis 29:28,29</ref> Rachel and Leah lived in Padan-Aram (in Mesopotamia).<ref>Genesis 28:2, Genesis 28:18-30</ref> They were Jacob's first cousins. They came from the same family as Rebekah.<ref> Genesis 29: 10, 12</ref> Rachel and Leah were both Abraham's great-great nieces and his great-great-great nieces. In the Jewish Tradition, Rachel and Leah were also the great-great nieces of Sarah. According to Jewish tradition, Bilhah and Zilpah, handmaidens of Rachel and Leah and the birth-mothers of four of the tribes, were Rachel and Leah's half-sisters. They had the same father as Rachel and Leah, but not the same mother.<ref>Gen.

Also, see Ruth Raba 2:9 that Ruth was the daughter of Eglon, the king of Moab.</ref> ''who lived centuries after Abraham,<ref>Gen.

Due to famine in the land, Elimelech went with his family to live in the fields of Moab and then died.<ref>Ruth 1: 3</ref> Naomi's two sons married Moabite women.

(I Kings 11:1)\nOf the nations about which the Lord had said to the Children of Israel, \"You shall not go (mingle) among them and they shall not come among you, for certainly they will sway your heart after their deities.\" To these did Solomon cleave to love [them]...

And now, give admission to the Lord, the God of your forefathers, and do His will, and separate from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.\" 12.

Only Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, the son of Tikvah, stood up against this, and Meshullam and Shabbathai the Levite supported them. 16. And the people of the exile did so.

The attempt to find reasons for the change, however, has proved to be elusive and is quite unnecessary since it can be explained entirely economically by the logic of the law itself and is typical of Rabbinic thinking in general. But the development in the law had already taken place before the redaction of the Mishnah at the very latest. With the exception of the Rabbi in the Jerusalem Talmud (Qiddushin, 3:12) who permitted the child of a gentile mother and Jewish father to be circumcised on the Sabbath and whose opinion was vehemently rejected, the law is accepted unanimously in both Talmuds. It is recorded as the law in all the Codes without dissenting voice and has been the universal norm in all Jewish communities. For such a law to be changed, only the weightiest religious and ethical advantages will suffice and it is difficult indeed to discover any such in the change in this particular instance. To change this particular law would strike at the heart of the whole halakhic process and would involve a theological as well as an halakhic upheaval. And for what? The potential loss is great. The gains, if any, are few and the price is far too high.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Shaye J. D. Cohen]] of Harvard University and formerly a Dean at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, questions the date of origin of matrilineal descent:\n<blockquote>The preexilic portions of the Hebrew Bible are not familiar with the matrilineal principle. Numerous Israelite heroes and kings married foreign women; for example, Judah married a Canaanite, Joseph an Egyptian, Moses a Midianite and an Ethiopian, David a Philistine, and Solomon women of every description. Although Exod. 34:16 and Deut. 7:1-3 prohibit intermarriage only with the Canaanites, a prohibition that was supposed to have originated with the patriarchs Abraham (Gen. 24:3) and Isaac (Gen. 27:46-28:1), some Israelites extended the prohibition to include all foreigners (Judg. 14:3). But it never occurred to anyone in preexilic times to argue that such marriages were null and void. Marriage was the non- sacramental, private acquisition of a woman by a man, and the state had little or no legal standing in the matter. The foreign woman who married an Israelite husband was supposed to leave her gods in her father's house, but even if she did not, it never occurred to anyone to argue that her children were not Israelites. Since the idea of conversion to Judaism did not yet exist, it never occurred to anyone to demand that the foreign woman undergo some ritual to indicate her acceptance of the religion of Israel. The woman was joined to the house of Israel by being joined to her Israelite husband; the act of marriage was functionally equivalent to the later idea of conversion. In some circumstances biblical law and society did pay attention to maternal identity-the children of concubines and female slaves some- times rank lower than the children of wives-but it never occurred to anyone to impose any legal or social disabilities on the children of foreign women.<ref>''The Origins of the Matrilineal Principle in Rabbinic Law'', Shaye J.D. Cohen, AJS Review, V. 10.1, 1985, 19-53</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his review of Cohen's article, Rabbi Jacobs accepts that the law may have changed in the early Tannaitic period (circa 10-70 CE): \"From the historical evidence marshalled by Professor Cohen it would appear that the change from the patrilineal to the matrilineal principle for the offspring of mixed unions of Jew and gentile took place in the early Tannaitic period.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\" />\n\nBut Jacobs dismisses Cohen's suggestion that \"the Tannaim were influenced by the Roman<ref>In Roman law, without ''connubium'', the right to contract a legal marriage according to Roman Law (i.e. where both parties are Roman citizens and where both parties gave consent), the marriage was not a ''justum matrimonium'', a legal Roman marriage and the children from such a union had no legal father and therefore followed the status (i.e. Roman citizenship status) of the mother. Interestingly, \u201c[t]hese restrictions as to marriage were not founded on any enactments; they were a part of that large mass of Roman law which belongs to ''Jus Moribus Constitutum'' [unwritten Roman law].\u201d http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Matrimonium.html</ref> legal system...\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\" /> and contends that \"even if the Rabbis were familiar with the Roman law, they might have reacted to it [instead] by preserving the patrilineal principle, holding fast to their own system.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\" />\n\nInstead, Jacobs offers another explanation. Jacobs believes that an Israelite man who married a non-Israelite woman and had a child, that woman and child were considered not part of the \"family clan\" and therefore were not considered Israelite: \"A child born of a Jewish father and a gentile mother cannot be given the status of the father since the patrilineal principle is stated only with regard to unions within the clan. How can the father who steps out of the clan bestow a clan status on the child whom he sires?\"<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/>\n\nTherefore, Jacobs hypothesizes:<blockquote>The child of a Jewish father and a gentile mother is not a gentile because of the application of any matrilineal principle...He is a child without Jewish parentage since the patrilineal principle cannot operate for a union carried out beyond the limits of the clan. The child is not a gentile because his mother is a gentile but because the only way a child can be born as a Jew is for him to have the Jewishness of his father transmitted to him and this cannot happen where the union is outside of the clan limits. Thus, for the Rabbis there is no switch here from a patrilineal to a matrilineal principle. The patrilineal principle still stands, only it cannot operate in this instance.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/></p></blockquote>\n\nThe Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism conducted a survey of 1,617 members of 27 Conservative congregations in the U.S. and Canada in 1995.<ref>Cohen, Steven M. \u201cChapter 1: Assessing the Vitality of Conservative Judaism in North America: Evidence from a Survey of Synagogue Members\u201d. In Wertheimer, Jack (2000). Jews in the Center: Conservative Synagogues and Their Members. Rutgers University Press, p. 20. Steven M. Cohen who co-conducted this survey (Wertheimer, 5) notes that the sample under represents congregants from certain major metropolitan areas (the New York region being represented by only one congregation and the Toronto and Montreal regions having no representation), over represents socially upscale congregants, and under represents congregants under the age of thirty-five. (Wertheimer, 20)</ref> 69% of respondents to the Ratner Center survey agreed that they would regard personally as a Jew anyone who was raised Jewish\u2014even if their mother was Gentile and their father was Jewish (Wertheimer, 59). In this same survey, 29% of respondents indicated that they attended Jewish religious services twice a month or more and 13% that they engage in the study of a Jewish text once a month or more (Wertheimer, 55-57).\n\n====Conservative Jewish Practices====\nThe [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Movement]] practices matrilineal descent. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative movement to the law of matrilineal descent. Furthermore, the movement stated that any rabbi who accepts the principle of patrilineal descent will be subject to expulsion from the Rabbinical Assembly. Still, the Conservative Movement affirmed that \"sincere Jews by choice\" should be warmly welcomed into the community and that \"sensitivity should be shown to Jews who have intermarried and their families.\" The Conservative movement actively reaches out to intermarried families by offering them opportunities for Jewish growth and enrichment.\n\n===Reform Judaism beliefs and practices===\nIn 1983, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary.org\"/> The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism]] has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.<ref>[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=840313&ct=1051515 Reform Judaism in Israel: Progress and Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=840313&ct=1051515 |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref> As well, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din formed in Denver, Colorado to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism was dissolved in 1983, due to that Reform resolution.<ref name=\"Wertheimer, A People Divided\">{{Cite book|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|title=A People Divided: Judaism in Contemporary America|publisher=University Press of New England|year=1997}}</ref> However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing \"that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process.\"<ref name=\"jpost1\">{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Jerry |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/UK-Reform-rabbis-accept-patrilineal-descent-409298 |title=UK Reform rabbis accept patrilineal descent - Diaspora - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-19}}</ref> Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis \"would be able to take local decisions \u2013 ratified by the [[Beit Din]] \u2013 confirming Jewish status.\"<ref name=\"jpost1\"/>\n\nOther movements within the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]] also adopted essentially the same position. These include: [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] in England; Progressive Judaism in Australia; one congregation in Austria; some congregations in Eastern Europe. Note that Reform Judaism in Canada and England adopts a different position, similar to that of Conservative Judaism (though there may be an accelerated conversion process for the children of Jewish fathers).\n\n===Karaite Judaism belief and practices===\nKaraite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. Karraite Judaism does not accept the authoritativeness of the Talmud or Jewish Oral Law.\n\n====Karaite Judaism practices====\nThe majority view in [[Karaite Judaism]] is that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent<ref>[http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml Karaite FAQs]; [http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/current_articles/Giyyur_Conversion.shtml Congregation Or Saddiqim, Giyyur]</ref><ref>[http://www.half-jewish.org/bibleintermarriage.html half-jewish.org/bibleintermarriage.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.half-jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.html half-jewish.org/who_is_born_a_jew.html]</ref> They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.<ref>[http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml]</ref> Only someone who is patrilineally Jewish (someone whose father's father was Jewish) is regarded as a Jew by the ''Mo'e\u1e63et Ha\u1e24akhamim'', or the Karaite Council of Sages based in Israel.\n\n===Reconstructionist Judaism belief and practices===\nReconstructionist Judaism, which values equity and inclusivity, was the first movement to adopt the idea of bilineal descent in 1968.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} According to Reconstructionist Judaism, children of one Jewish parent, of either gender, are considered Jewish if raised as Jews.\n\n===Additional notes===\nThe State of Israel adheres to the Jewish law of matrilineal descent for matters which could affect Israeli family law.<ref>For the re-affirmation of matrilineal descent by the Chief Rabbinical Board of the State of Israel see Elberg, Rabbi S., September, 1984, HaPardes Rabbinical Journal, Hebrew, vol.59, Is.1, p. 21.</ref>\n\nSeven marriage contracts that took place before the 13th century between Karaite and Rabbinic individuals have so far been discovered in the [[Cairo Genizah]].<ref>https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women:\n<blockquote> \nPERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE \u2026Marriages with Rabbanite partners were perfectly legal and commonly practised before the thirteenth century. Medieval Karaism was and saw itself as an integral part of Judaism, and such marriages did not entail any form of \"conversion\" of any of the parties. Seven marriage contracts involving Karaite and Rabbanite individuals have so far been discovered in the Cairo Genizah. These marriage contracts stipulated the mutual tolerance of those practices in which the Karaites and the Rabbanites differed. These specific stipulations concerned differences in dietary law, such as the Rabbanite husband's promise not to bring to their house parts of animals authorized by the Rabbanites but forbidden by the Karaite halakhah (the fat tail, the kidneys, the lobe of the liver, the meat of a pregnant animal). Other stipulations concerned the Karaite restrictions on lighting the Sabbath candles and the promise of Rabbanite husbands not to make love to their Karaite wives during Sabbath and festivals\u2014practices strictly forbidden by Karaite law. Due to the calendrical differences, Karaite and Rabbanite festivals did not coincide, and the marriage contracts always included a clause which guaranteed that both parties would be allowed to observe their festivals on their respective dates. </p></blockquote></ref> In the 12th century, approximately 25,000 Jews lived in Egypt, mostly in Cairo.<ref>https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-cairo/</ref> A percentage of the Jewish community was [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]].<ref>It is not specifically known what percentage of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community was Karaite.

Today, there are 11 Karaite synagogues in Israel. See https://www.jweekly.com/1999/12/10/israel-s-30-000-karaites-follow-bible-not-talmud/</ref> [[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] became one of the leaders of the Jewish community in Egypt shortly after his arrival there in 1165 CE. Virtually all Jews in the world at this time including the Egyptian Jewish Community followed matrilineal descent. In fact, Maimonides (1138-1204 CE) himself re-codified the law of matrilineal descent in his compilation of Jewish Law:<blockquote>This is the general rule: The status of an offspring from a gentile man or from a gentile woman is the same as his mother's; we disregard the father.<ref>Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (c. 1170-1180 CE), Laws of Forbidden Relationships, 15:4</ref></p></blockquote> The Egyptian Jewish Karaites, however, followed patrilineal descent.<ref>Yaron, Y., Joe Pessah, and Abraham Qanai. An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice, and Culture. N.p.: Qirqisani Center, 2003. Print.</ref> Still, these same 12th century Egyptian Karaites forbade marriage with non-Jews<ref>https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women <blockquote> \nPERMISSIBILITY OF MARRIAGE \nIn order to contract marriage, the parties must be \"marriageable,\" that is: the partners must be Jewish, the woman must be unmarried, and the parties should not fall into any of the kinship categories prohibited by Karaite law. \n1. The parties' religious affiliation \nMarriages with non-Jewish partners are not acceptable for Karaites...</p></blockquote></ref> and also did not allow converts into their community.<ref>This ban was recently lifted by the Karaite Council of Sages.</ref> In effect then, 12th century Egyptian Karaites required that ''both'' parents be Jewish, but they referred to this requirement as patrilineal descent. Marriages between Karaites and the Rabbinic community came to a halt in the thirteenth century when Maimonides ruled for a specific serious reason that there was a problem with them.<ref>https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women. In the 13th century Maimonides ruled that they fell under the classification of ''mamzerut''.\nhttps://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women: \n<blockquote> \nMarriages between Karaite and Rabbanite partners came to a halt when Moses MAIMONIDES (Rambam, 1138\u20131204) argued that while the Karaite marriage itself was binding, their bill of divorce was invalid (probably because of its formulation in Hebrew). Since the children issued from the second union of a Karaite divorc\u00e9e would be illegitimate (mamzerim), and since it was not always possible to ascertain that a divorce had not occurred &#91;sic&#93; in previous generations in a Karaite family, Maimonides decided to consider all Karaites as potential mamzerim, and therefore prohibited for marriage. </blockquote></ref> This specific ruling by Maimonides also means that Maimonides considered the Karaites of 800 yrs ago of the 12th century Egyptian Jewish community to be Jewish on their mother's side as well.\n\n==Additional reference from Jewish Scripture==\nSamson, from the tribe of Dan served as Judge of Israel for twenty years.<ref>Judges 13:25, 15:20</ref> According to current scholarship, the most recent likely date for the authorship of the Book of Judges is approximately 500 BCE.<ref>http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9051-judges-book-of : \u201cHence the compilation of the stories of the five Great Judges must be dated soon after the division of the kingdom. Single passages\u2026 may be much older. The editor who combined his own additions with the book containing the stories, producing thereby the earlier Book of Judges, probably wrote in the last decades of the kingdom of Israel. The Deuteronomistic edition was undertaken during the Exile at which time the other additions were probably also incorporated\u2026.\u201d</ref> The reaction of Samson's parents to his desired marriage to a Philistine woman may indicate the cultural expectations in Israel regarding marriage at this time:<blockquote> And his father and his mother said to him, \u201cIs there no woman among the daughters of your brothers and among all of my people that you should go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?\u201d\u2026 <ref>Judges 14:3</ref></p></blockquote>In the account of the Book of Judges, Samson married this woman and soon killed thirty Philistine men in Ashkelon.<ref>Judges 14</ref> (Samson's wife was then given to another man by her father who said that Samson utterly hated her.<ref>Judges 15: 2</ref> Samson then set the fields of the Philistines on fire.<ref>Judges 15:3-5</ref> The Philistines then went and killed this woman and her father.<ref>Judges 15: 6</ref>)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Who is a Jew?]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*Immanuel Jakobovits, \u201cThe Timely and the Timeless\u201d, London 1977, pp. 199-203,[https://www.worldcat.org/title/timely-and-the-timeless-jews-judaism-and-society-in-a-storm-tossed-decade/oclc/3584417]\n*[[Judith Olszowy-Schlanger]], [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/karaite-women \"Karaite Women: Permissibility of Marriage\"]\n*[https://louisjacobs.org/articles/there-is-no-problem-of-descent/ Louis Jacobs, \"There is No Problem of Descent\"]\n*Professor [[Shaye J.

[[Maimonides]] connected its materialization with the coming of the [[Jewish messianism|Messiah]].\n\nThe gathering of the exiles in the land of Israel, became the core idea of the [[Zionist Movement]]<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/glossK.html Kibbutz Galuyot], [[Jewish Virtual Library]], Glossary</ref> and the core idea of [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israel's Scroll of Independence]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Dec_of_Indep.html|title=The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel - Jewish Virtual Library|work=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref> ([[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|''Megilat Ha'atzmaut'']]<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/glossM.html Megillat Ha'atzmaut], Jewish Virtual Library, Glossary</ref>), embodied by the idea of going up, [[Aliyah]], since the ''Holy Land'' is considered to be spiritually higher than all other land.

They argue that the Torah attested to a period, not a person, the period in which the People of Israel return to their homeland, the land of Israel. The act of ingathering of the exiles of Israel in the land of Israel, a ''Kibbutz Galuyot'', will bring about the coming of the messiah, as the hand of God is in the events of the creation of the State of Israel, obviously a different reality then Maimonides depicts, though they see the writings of Maimonides as a way of learning the importance of the role of the messiah, since the Maimonides was a scholar not a prophet, and did not live up to see the event of the establishment of the State of Israel.<ref>[http://www.yba.org.il/show.asp?id=19580&big_cat=1430 www.yba.org.il 1430] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721144151/http://www.yba.org.il/show.asp?id=19580&big_cat=1430 |date=2011-07-21 }} (Hebrew language site)</ref>\n\n[[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], one of the leaders of the [[Religious Zionist Movement]], used to quote from the [[Responsa]] book, ''Yeshuot Malko'', of [[Israel Yehosha]] of kutna, in conjunction with Aliyah (10:66): \"There is no doubt that this is a greater [[Mitzvah]] (a commandment of the Torah), because the gathering is an '' [[Atchalta De'Geulah]] ''<ref>(Babylonian Talmud, order Moed, Tractate Megilah 17b)</ref> ('the beginning of the redemption'), as attested, \"I will yet gather others to him, together with his gathered ones\" (Isaiah, 56:8), and see ''Yebamoth'', page 64, \"the Divine Presence does not rest on less than two myriads of Israelites\",<ref>(Babylonian Talmud, order Nashim, Tractate Yebamoth 64a)</ref> especially nowadays in which we have seen the great desire inasmuch as in men of lesser importance, mediocre ones, and upright in heart, it is more than likely that we would gleam with the spirit of salvation, fortunate are the \"ones who\" take part in \"bringing merit unto the masses\"<ref>(Babylon Talmud, order Moed, Tractate Yoma 97a)<br />[http://www.yba.org.il/show.asp?id=19580&big_cat=1430 www.yba.org.il 1430] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721144151/http://www.yba.org.il/show.asp?id=19580&big_cat=1430 |date=2011-07-21 }} (Hebrew language site)<br />[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/15987/jewish/Chapter-56.htm#v8 Isaiah 56:8 at chabad.org]</ref>\n\n[[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Chabad]] movement takes the writings of the Maimonides literally: The messiah is assigned to mission of completing the ingathering the exiles of Israel.

''Aliyah Bet'' was organized by the [[Yishuv]] (the Jewish settlement in the land of Israel before Israel's establishment as a country) from 1934 until the State of Israel began in 1948. ''Aliyah Bet'' was carried out by the [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet]], a branch of the Jewish Defense Association ([[Haganah]]), the para-military organization that was to become the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF). During ''Aliyah Bet'' 's 14 years of activity, 115,000 Jews made ''Aliyah'' to the land of Israel.\n\nThe term ''Aliyah Bet'' is composed of the Hebrew word ''Aliyah'', meaning Jewish Immigration (Individual or a group) to the land of Israel, and the Hebrew Letter ''Bet'', the second letter in the [[Hebrew Alphabet]]. Its use was analogous to the [[English language|English]] term \"Plan B\". Vis-a-vis, the illegal transportation of immigrants was being carried out simultaneously with the legal Jewish immigration to the land of Israel permitted by the British Mandate. The Mandate attempted to limit the number of immigration certificates in a way which contradicted the national goals of the Jewish community living there. ''Aliyah Bet'' started only modestly in the midst of the nineteen-thirties. The majority of Jewish immigrants, the [[Olim]], arrived after World War II and the Holocaust.\n\n''Aliyah Bet'' was carried out in various methods:\n# Through the sea (the main method)\n# Through land routes (mainly through [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]])\n# Through the air (This method was started in 1947-48 when two airplanes landed in the Lower [[Galilee]] village of [[Yavne'el]], as part of \"Operation Michaelberg\"\u2014defying the British Mandate Government objection.

''Aliyah Bet'' was organized by the [[Yishuv]] (the Jewish settlement in the land of Israel before Israel's establishment as a country) from 1934 until the State of Israel began in 1948. ''Aliyah Bet'' was carried out by the [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet]], a branch of the Jewish Defense Association ([[Haganah]]), the para-military organization that was to become the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF). During ''Aliyah Bet'' 's 14 years of activity, 115,000 Jews made ''Aliyah'' to the land of Israel.\n\nThe term ''Aliyah Bet'' is composed of the Hebrew word ''Aliyah'', meaning Jewish Immigration (Individual or a group) to the land of Israel, and the Hebrew Letter ''Bet'', the second letter in the [[Hebrew Alphabet]]. Its use was analogous to the [[English language|English]] term \"Plan B\". Vis-a-vis, the illegal transportation of immigrants was being carried out simultaneously with the legal Jewish immigration to the land of Israel permitted by the British Mandate. The Mandate attempted to limit the number of immigration certificates in a way which contradicted the national goals of the Jewish community living there. ''Aliyah Bet'' started only modestly in the midst of the nineteen-thirties. The majority of Jewish immigrants, the [[Olim]], arrived after World War II and the Holocaust.\n\n''Aliyah Bet'' was carried out in various methods:\n# Through the sea (the main method)\n# Through land routes (mainly through [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]])\n# Through the air (This method was started in 1947-48 when two airplanes landed in the Lower [[Galilee]] village of [[Yavne'el]], as part of \"Operation Michaelberg\"\u2014defying the British Mandate Government objection.
