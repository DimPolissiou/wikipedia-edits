He was renowned for his onstage vitality, during which virtuoso improvisation was accompanied by comic banter, political ranting, and the ability to play several instruments simultaneously.\n\n== Life ==\n\nKirk was born Ronald Theodore Kirk<ref name=\"Grove\" /> in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], where he lived in a neighborhood known as [[Flytown]]. He became blind at two years old, which he said was a result of improper medical treatment. As a teenager, Kirk studied at the [[Ohio State School for the Blind]]. By age fifteen he was on the road playing rhythm and blues on weekends with Boyd Moore's band. According to saxophonist [[Hank Crawford]], \"He would be like this 14 year-old blind kid playing two horns at once. They would bring him out and he would tear the joint up.\" Hank heard him during this period and said he was unbelievable. He remarked, \"Now they had him doing all kinds of goofy stuff but he was playing the two horns and he was playing the shit out of them. He was an original from the beginning.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Kirk felt compelled by a dream to transpose two letters in his first name to make '\"Roland\".<ref name=Heining>[https://www.allaboutjazz.com/roland-kirk-here-comes-the-whistleman-roland-kirk-by-duncan-heining.php Roland Kirk: Here Comes The Whistleman], ''[[All About Jazz]]'', Duncan Heining, October 19, 2016.

During his concerts, between songs he often talked about topical issues, including [[African-American history]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. His monologues were often laced with satire and absurdist humor. According to comedian [[Jay Leno]], when Leno toured with Kirk as Kirk's opening act, Kirk would introduce him by saying, \"I want to introduce a young brother who knows the black experience and knows all about the white devils .... Please welcome Jay Leno!\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCaXb0Fi4HEC&lpg=PT132&ots=rO85nbAGBv&dq=leno%20%22rahsaan%20roland%20kirk%22&pg=PT132#v=onepage&q=leno%20%22rahsaan%20roland%20kirk%22&f=false|title=Satiristas: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs & Vulgarians|last=Provenza|first=Paul|author2=Dan Dion|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=0061859346|page=s368}}</ref>{{rp|109}}\n\nIn 1975, Kirk suffered a major stroke which led to partial paralysis of one side of his body. He continued to perform and record, modifying his instruments to enable him to play with one arm. At a live performance at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in London he even managed to play two instruments, and carried on to tour internationally and to appear on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/26e696f79975401f8b8677dd8b766e88|title=Newcastle Jazz Festival|work=Genome Radio Times 1923-2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe died from a second stroke in 1977, the morning after performing in the Frangipani Room of the [[Indiana University]] Student Union in [[Bloomington, Indiana]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=22 December 1977|title=Recalling Jazzman Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Dead At 41|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=53|issue=14|pages=14\u201315|issn=0021-5996}}</ref>\n\n== Instruments and techniques ==\n[[File:19720100 RolandKirk KT 06.jpg|thumb|left|19720100 RolandKirk KT 06|Kirk in 1972]]\n\nKirk's musical career spans from 1955 until his death in 1977. He preferred to lead his own bands and rarely performed as a sideman, although he did record with arranger [[Quincy Jones]], drummer [[Roy Haynes]] and worked with bassist [[Charles Mingus]]. One of his best-known recorded performances is the lead flute and solo on Jones' \"[[Soul Bossa Nova]]\", a 1964 hit song repopularized in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' films.<ref>Jones 1964</ref>{{better source|date=December 2018}}<ref>McLeod et al. 1997</ref>{{better source|date=December 2018}}\n\nKirk's multi-instrumentality was credited as having a substantial musical conception. This inclusivity included blues music, a love of stride piano and early jazz, and an appreciation for pop tunes. But his vision was much wider than most of his contemporaries. According to producer Joel Dorn, he was also hugely knowledgeable about classical music. Pieces by [[Saint-Saens]], [[Hindemith]], [[Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvorak]] and [[Villa-Lobos]] would all feature on his albums over the years, alongside standards, pop songs and original compositions. Rahsaan's influences went beyond jazz and consequentially, he preferred the term 'Black Classical Music.'<ref name=\"Heining\" />\n\nHis playing was generally rooted in [[soul jazz]] or [[hard bop]], but Kirk's knowledge of jazz history allowed him to draw from many elements of the music's past, from [[ragtime]] to [[Swing (genre)|swing]] and [[free jazz]]. Kirk also absorbed [[classical music|classical]] influences, and his artistry reflected elements of [[pop music]] by composers such as [[Smokey Robinson]] and [[Burt Bacharach]], as well as [[Duke Ellington]], [[John Coltrane]] and other jazz musicians. The live album ''[[Bright Moments (Rahsaan Roland Kirk album)|Bright Moments]]'' (1973) is an example of one of his shows.\n\nKirk played and collected many musical instruments, mainly multiple [[saxophone]]s, [[clarinet]]s and [[flute]]s. His primary saxophones were a standard [[tenor saxophone]], [[stritch (saxophone)|stritch]] (a straight alto sax lacking the instrument's conventional upturned bell), and a [[manzello]] (a modified [[saxello]] soprano sax, with a larger, upturned bell). A number of his instruments were exotic or homemade. Kirk modified instruments himself to accommodate his simultaneous playing technique.<ref>\"With one instrument functioning as a drone and keywork modification to the other two, Kirk was able to play in three part harmony with himself.\" Stephen Cottrell (2012). The Saxophone, Yale University Press p. 289</ref> Critic [[Gary Giddins]] wrote that Kirk's tenor playing alone was enough to bring him \"renown\".<ref name=Giddins/>\n\nUsually, he appeared on stage with all three horns hanging around his neck, and at times he would play a number of these horns at once, harmonizing with himself, or sustain a note for lengthy durations by using [[circular breathing]]. He used the multiple horns to play true chords, essentially functioning as a one-man saxophone section. Kirk insisted that he was only trying to emulate the sounds he heard in his head. Even while playing two or three saxophones at once, the music was intricate, powerful jazz with a strong feel for the blues.<ref name=Giddins/>\n\nKirk was also an influential flute player, including [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]]. According to Giddins, Kirk was the first major jazz innovator on flute after [[Eric Dolphy]] (who died in 1964).<ref name=Giddins/> Kirk employed several techniques, including singing or humming into the flute at the same time as playing. Another was to play the standard transverse flute at the same time as a [[nose flute]].\n\nHe played a variety of other instruments, including whistles; often kept a gong within reach; the [[clarinet]], [[harmonica]], [[English horn]], and was a competent [[trumpeter]].<ref>See his version of \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" on ''[[The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color]]'' (1975) in which he introduces the theme on trumpet before switching to saxophones for the remainder of the song.</ref> He utilized unique approaches, such as playing a trumpet with a saxophone mouthpiece.\n\nHe also made use of non-musical devices, such as alarm clocks, sirens, or a section of common garden hose (dubbed \"the black mystery pipes\"). From the early 1970s, his studio recordings used tape-manipulated ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' and primitive electronic sounds before such things became commonplace.<ref name=Giddins/>\n{{Listen\n| type         = music\n| title        = Flute\n| filename     = Rahsaan flute clip.ogg\n| description  = Rahsaan simultaneously playing flute and singing, punctuated with a siren whistle.\n| filename2    = Rahsaan blackmysterypipes.ogg\n| title2       = Black mystery pipes\n| description2 = Rahsaan playing black mystery pipes.\n| title3       = Saxophones\n| filename3    = Rahsaan multiplesax.ogg\n| description3 = Rahsaan simultaneously playing multiple saxophones. \n}}\n\n''[[The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color]]'' was a unique album in jazz and popular music recorded annals. It was a two-LP set, with Side 4 apparently \"blank\", the label not indicating any content. However, once word of \"the secret message\" got around among Rahsaan's fans, one would find that about 12 minutes into Side 4 appeared the first of two telephone answering machine messages recorded by Kirk, the second following soon thereafter (but separated by more blank grooves). The surprise impact of these segments appearing on \"blank\" Side 4 was lost on the CD reissue of this album.\n\nHe gleaned information on what was happening in the world via radio and TV. His later recordings often incorporated his spoken commentaries on current events, including [[Richard Nixon]]'s involvement in the [[Watergate scandal]]. The ''3-Sided Dream'' album was a \"concept album\" which incorporated \"found\" or environmental sounds and [[tape loops]], tapes being played backwards, etc. Snippets of [[Billie Holiday]] singing are also heard briefly. The album even confronts the rise of influence of computers in society, as Rahsaan threatens to pull the plug on the machine trying to tell him what to do.\n\nIn the album ''[[Other Folks' Music]]'' the spoken words of [[Paul Robeson]], another outspoken black artist, can be briefly heard.\n\n==Material loss==\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Rahsaan Roland Kirk among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n* [[Ian Anderson]], leader and flautist of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] recorded a version of Kirk's \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" on their first album ''[[This Was]]'' (1968).

Anderson learned Kirk\u2019s vocalizing style on the flute and Anderson's flute playing became the signature element of Jethro Tull's sound. Kirk and Anderson took the flute's refined upper crust classical nature and commonized it. Anderson got to know Kirk at the 1969 [[Newport Jazz Festival]] where they both performed the same night. Anderson said of Kirk \"There\u2019s something about these colourful shamans. They can tease us, but we go along with it, because we know they\u2019re touched by genius, but at the same time there\u2019s a little bit of the snake oil for sale.\u201d<ref name=\"jazztimes.com\">{{cite web |last1=Himes |first1=Geoffrey |title=Rahsaan Roland Kirk: The Cult of Kirk |url=https://jazztimes.com/features/rahsaan-roland-kirk-the-cult-of-kirk/ |website=jazztimes |accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Jeff Coffin]], the saxophonist in [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] and the Flecktones was heavily influenced by Kirk's music and says he learned through Kirk that it's OK to experiment with an instrument.

He was renowned for his onstage vitality, during which virtuoso improvisation was accompanied by comic banter, political ranting, and the ability to play several instruments simultaneously.\n\n== Life ==\n\nKirk was born Ronald Theodore Kirk<ref name=\"Grove\" /> in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], where he lived in a neighborhood known as [[Flytown]]. He became blind at two years old, which he said was a result of improper medical treatment. As a teenager, Kirk studied at the [[Ohio State School for the Blind]]. By age fifteen he was on the road playing rhythm and blues on weekends with Boyd Moore's band. According to saxophonist [[Hank Crawford]], \"He would be like this 14 year-old blind kid playing two horns at once. They would bring him out and he would tear the joint up.\" Hank heard him during this period and said he was unbelievable. He remarked, \"Now they had him doing all kinds of goofy stuff but he was playing the two horns and he was playing the shit out of them. He was an original from the beginning.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Kirk felt compelled by a dream to transpose two letters in his first name to make '\"Roland\".<ref name=Heining>[https://www.allaboutjazz.com/roland-kirk-here-comes-the-whistleman-roland-kirk-by-duncan-heining.php Roland Kirk: Here Comes The Whistleman], ''[[All About Jazz]]'', Duncan Heining, October 19, 2016.

During his concerts, between songs he often talked about topical issues, including [[African-American history]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. His monologues were often laced with satire and absurdist humor. According to comedian [[Jay Leno]], when Leno toured with Kirk as Kirk's opening act, Kirk would introduce him by saying, \"I want to introduce a young brother who knows the black experience and knows all about the white devils .... Please welcome Jay Leno!\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCaXb0Fi4HEC&lpg=PT132&ots=rO85nbAGBv&dq=leno%20%22rahsaan%20roland%20kirk%22&pg=PT132#v=onepage&q=leno%20%22rahsaan%20roland%20kirk%22&f=false|title=Satiristas: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs & Vulgarians|last=Provenza|first=Paul|author2=Dan Dion|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=0061859346|page=s368}}</ref>{{rp|109}}\n\nIn 1975, Kirk suffered a major stroke which led to partial paralysis of one side of his body. He continued to perform and record, modifying his instruments to enable him to play with one arm. At a live performance at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in London he even managed to play two instruments, and carried on to tour internationally and to appear on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/26e696f79975401f8b8677dd8b766e88|title=Newcastle Jazz Festival|work=Genome Radio Times 1923-2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe died from a second stroke in 1977, the morning after performing in the Frangipani Room of the [[Indiana University]] Student Union in [[Bloomington, Indiana]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=22 December 1977|title=Recalling Jazzman Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Dead At 41|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=53|issue=14|pages=14\u201315|issn=0021-5996}}</ref>\n\n== Instruments and techniques ==\n[[File:19720100 RolandKirk KT 06.jpg|thumb|left|19720100 RolandKirk KT 06|Kirk in 1972]]\n\nKirk's musical career spans from 1955 until his death in 1977. He preferred to lead his own bands and rarely performed as a sideman, although he did record with arranger [[Quincy Jones]], drummer [[Roy Haynes]] and worked with bassist [[Charles Mingus]]. One of his best-known recorded performances is the lead flute and solo on Jones' \"[[Soul Bossa Nova]]\", a 1964 hit song repopularized in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' films.<ref>Jones 1964</ref>{{better source|date=December 2018}}<ref>McLeod et al. 1997</ref>{{better source|date=December 2018}}\n\nKirk's multi-instrumentality was credited as having a substantial musical conception. This inclusivity included blues music, a love of stride piano and early jazz, and an appreciation for pop tunes. But his vision was much wider than most of his contemporaries. According to producer Joel Dorn, he was also hugely knowledgeable about classical music. Pieces by [[Saint-Saens]], [[Hindemith]], [[Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvorak]] and [[Villa-Lobos]] would all feature on his albums over the years, alongside standards, pop songs and original compositions. Rahsaan's influences went beyond jazz and consequentially, he preferred the term 'Black Classical Music.'<ref name=\"Heining\" />\n\nHis playing was generally rooted in [[soul jazz]] or [[hard bop]], but Kirk's knowledge of jazz history allowed him to draw from many elements of the music's past, from [[ragtime]] to [[Swing (genre)|swing]] and [[free jazz]]. Kirk also absorbed [[classical music|classical]] influences, and his artistry reflected elements of [[pop music]] by composers such as [[Smokey Robinson]] and [[Burt Bacharach]], as well as [[Duke Ellington]], [[John Coltrane]] and other jazz musicians. The live album ''[[Bright Moments (Rahsaan Roland Kirk album)|Bright Moments]]'' (1973) is an example of one of his shows.\n\nKirk played and collected many musical instruments, mainly multiple [[saxophone]]s, [[clarinet]]s and [[flute]]s. His primary saxophones were a standard [[tenor saxophone]], [[stritch (saxophone)|stritch]] (a straight alto sax lacking the instrument's conventional upturned bell), and a [[manzello]] (a modified [[saxello]] soprano sax, with a larger, upturned bell). A number of his instruments were exotic or homemade. Kirk modified instruments himself to accommodate his simultaneous playing technique.<ref>\"With one instrument functioning as a drone and keywork modification to the other two, Kirk was able to play in three part harmony with himself.\" Stephen Cottrell (2012). The Saxophone, Yale University Press p. 289</ref> Critic [[Gary Giddins]] wrote that Kirk's tenor playing alone was enough to bring him \"renown\".<ref name=Giddins/>\n\nUsually, he appeared on stage with all three horns hanging around his neck, and at times he would play a number of these horns at once, harmonizing with himself, or sustain a note for lengthy durations by using [[circular breathing]]. He used the multiple horns to play true chords, essentially functioning as a one-man saxophone section. Kirk insisted that he was only trying to emulate the sounds he heard in his head. Even while playing two or three saxophones at once, the music was intricate, powerful jazz with a strong feel for the blues.<ref name=Giddins/>\n\nKirk was also an influential flute player, including [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]]. According to Giddins, Kirk was the first major jazz innovator on flute after [[Eric Dolphy]] (who died in 1964).<ref name=Giddins/> Kirk employed several techniques, including singing or humming into the flute at the same time as playing. Another was to play the standard transverse flute at the same time as a [[nose flute]].\n\nHe played a variety of other instruments, including whistles; often kept a gong within reach; the [[clarinet]], [[harmonica]], [[English horn]], and was a competent [[trumpeter]].<ref>See his version of \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" on ''[[The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color]]'' (1975) in which he introduces the theme on trumpet before switching to saxophones for the remainder of the song.</ref> He utilized unique approaches, such as playing a trumpet with a saxophone mouthpiece.\n\nHe also used many non-musical devices, such as alarm clocks, sirens, or a section of common garden hose (dubbed \"the black mystery pipes\"). From the early 1970s, his studio recordings used tape-manipulated ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' and primitive electronic sounds before such things became commonplace.<ref name=Giddins/>\n{{Listen\n| type         = music\n| title        = Flute\n| filename     = Rahsaan flute clip.ogg\n| description  = Rahsaan simultaneously playing flute and singing, punctuated with a siren whistle.\n| filename2    = Rahsaan blackmysterypipes.ogg\n| title2       = Black mystery pipes\n| description2 = Rahsaan playing black mystery pipes.\n| title3       = Saxophones\n| filename3    = Rahsaan multiplesax.ogg\n| description3 = Rahsaan simultaneously playing multiple saxophones. \n}}\n\n''[[The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color]]'' was a unique album in jazz and popular music recorded annals. It was a two-LP set, with Side 4 apparently \"blank\", the label not indicating any content. However, once word of \"the secret message\" got around among Rahsaan's fans, one would find that about 12 minutes into Side 4 appeared the first of two telephone answering machine messages recorded by Kirk, the second following soon thereafter (but separated by more blank grooves). The surprise impact of these segments appearing on \"blank\" Side 4 was lost on the CD reissue of this album.\n\nHe gleaned information on what was happening in the world via radio and TV. His later recordings often incorporated his spoken commentaries on current events, including [[Richard Nixon]]'s involvement in the [[Watergate scandal]]. The ''3-Sided Dream'' album was a \"concept album\" which incorporated \"found\" or environmental sounds and [[tape loops]], tapes being played backwards, etc. Snippets of [[Billie Holiday]] singing are also heard briefly. The album even confronts the rise of influence of computers in society, as Rahsaan threatens to pull the plug on the machine trying to tell him what to do.\n\nIn the album ''[[Other Folks' Music]]'' the spoken words of [[Paul Robeson]], another outspoken black artist, can be briefly heard.\n\n==Material loss==\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Rahsaan Roland Kirk among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n* [[Ian Anderson]], leader and flautist of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] recorded a version of Kirk's \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" on their first album ''[[This Was]]'' (1968).

Anderson learned Kirk\u2019s vocalizing style on the flute and Anderson's flute playing became the signature element of Jethro Tull's sound. Kirk and Anderson took the flute's refined upper crust classical nature and commonized it. Anderson got to know Kirk at the 1969 [[Newport Jazz Festival]] where they both performed the same night. Anderson said of Kirk \"There\u2019s something about these colourful shamans. They can tease us, but we go along with it, because we know they\u2019re touched by genius, but at the same time there\u2019s a little bit of the snake oil for sale.\u201d<ref name=\"jazztimes.com\">{{cite web |last1=Himes |first1=Geoffrey |title=Rahsaan Roland Kirk: The Cult of Kirk |url=https://jazztimes.com/features/rahsaan-roland-kirk-the-cult-of-kirk/ |website=jazztimes |accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Jeff Coffin]], the saxophonist in [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] and the Flecktones was heavily influenced by Kirk's music and says he learned through Kirk that it's OK to experiment with an instrument.

One of these pathways, known as [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch signaling]], is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal [[immune system]] function. Studies suggest that mutations in the NCSTN, PSEN1, or PSENEN gene impair Notch signaling in hair follicles.

Hurley separated patients into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of [[Wound healing|cicatrization]] and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for [[clinical trials]] in the past and is a useful basis to approach [[therapy]] for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley's staging system, which is simple and relies on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] extent of the diseased [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] the patient has. Hurley's three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are:<ref>Hurley HJ. Axillary hyperhidrosis, apocrine bromhidrosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and familial benign pemphigus: surgical approach.

Characteristics\n|-\n| I\n| Solitary or multiple isolated abscess formation without scarring or sinus tracts  (A few minor sites with rare inflammation; may be mistaken for [[Acne vulgaris|acne]].)\n|-\n| II\n| Recurrent abscesses, single or multiple widely separated [[lesions]], with sinus tract formation.  (Frequent [[inflammation]] restrict movement and may require minor [[surgery]] such as [[incision and drainage]].)\n|-\n| III\n| Diffuse or broad involvement across a regional area with multiple interconnected sinus tracts and abscesses  ([[Inflammation]] of sites to the size of golf balls, or sometimes baseballs; scarring develops, including [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] tracts of infection \u2013 see [[fistula]].  Obviously, patients at this stage may be unable to function.)\n|}\n\n==== Sartorius staging system ====\n\nThe Sartorius staging system is more sophisticated than Hurley's. Sartorius ''et al.'' suggested that the Hurley system is not sophisticated enough to assess treatment effects in clinical trials during research. This classification allows for better dynamic monitoring of the disease severity in individual patients. The elements of this staging system are:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sartorius K, Lapins J, Emtestam L, Jemec GB | title = Suggestions for uniform outcome variables when reporting treatment effects in hidradenitis suppurativa | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 149 | issue = 1 | pages = 211\u20133 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12890229 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05390.x }}</ref>\n\n* [[Anatomic]] regions involved (axilla, groin gluteal, or other region or inframammary region left or right)\n* Number and types of [[lesions]] involved (abscesses, [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], [[fistulas]] [actually sinuses], scars, points for lesions of all regions involved)\n* The distance between lesions, in particular the longest distance between two relevant lesions (i.e., nodules and fistulas in each region or size if only one lesion present)\n* The presence of normal skin in between lesions (i.e., are all lesions clearly separated by normal skin?)\n\nPoints are accumulated in each of the above categories, and added to give both a regional and total score.

One of his colleagues also located in Paris, named Verneuil, coined the term ''hidrosad\u00e9nite phlegmoneuse'' about 15 years later. This name for the disease reflects the former [[pathogenetic]] model of acne inversa, which is considered [[inflammation]] of sweat glands as the primary cause of hidradenitis suppurativa. In 1922, Schiefferdecker suspected a pathogenic association between acne inversa and apocrine sweat glands. In 1956 Pillsbury postulated follicular occlusion as the cause of acne inversa, which they grouped together with acne conglobata and perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens (dissecting cellulitis of the scalp) as the \"acne triad\". Plewig and Kligman added another element to their acne triad, [[pilonidal sinus]]. Plewig ''et al.'' noted that this new \"acne tetrad\" includes all the elements found in the original \"acne triad\", in addition to a fourth element, pilonidal sinus. In 1989, Plewig and Steger introduced the term \"acne inversa\", indicating a follicular source of the disease and replacing older terms such as \"Verneuil disease\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One of these pathways, known as [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch signaling]], is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal [[immune system]] function. Studies suggest that mutations in the NCSTN, PSEN1, or PSENEN gene impair Notch signaling in hair follicles.

Hurley separated patients into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of [[Wound healing|cicatrization]] and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for [[clinical trials]] in the past and is a useful basis to approach [[therapy]] for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley's staging system, which is simple and relies on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] extent of the diseased [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] the patient has. Hurley's three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are:<ref>Hurley HJ. Axillary hyperhidrosis, apocrine bromhidrosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and familial benign pemphigus: surgical approach.

(Frequent [[inflammation]] restrict movement and may require minor [[surgery]] such as [[incision and drainage]].)\n|-\n| III\n| Diffuse or broad involvement across a regional area with multiple interconnected sinus tracts and abscesses  ([[Inflammation]] of sites to the size of golf balls, or sometimes baseballs; scarring develops, including [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] tracts of infection \u2013 see [[fistula]].  Obviously, patients at this stage may be unable to function.)\n|}\n\n==== Sartorius staging system ====\n\nThe Sartorius staging system is more sophisticated than Hurley's. Sartorius ''et al.'' suggested that the Hurley system is not sophisticated enough to assess treatment effects in clinical trials during research. This classification allows for better dynamic monitoring of the disease severity in individual patients. The elements of this staging system are:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sartorius K, Lapins J, Emtestam L, Jemec GB | title = Suggestions for uniform outcome variables when reporting treatment effects in hidradenitis suppurativa | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 149 | issue = 1 | pages = 211\u20133 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12890229 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05390.x }}</ref>\n\n* [[Anatomic]] regions involved (axilla, groin gluteal, or other region or inframammary region left or right)\n* Number and types of [[lesions]] involved (abscesses, [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], [[fistulas]] [actually sinuses], scars, points for lesions of all regions involved)\n* The distance between lesions, in particular the longest distance between two relevant lesions (i.e., nodules and fistulas in each region or size if only one lesion present)\n* The presence of normal skin in between lesions (i.e., are all lesions clearly separated by normal skin?)\n\nPoints are accumulated in each of the above categories, and added to give both a regional and total score.

One of his colleagues also located in Paris, named Verneuil, coined the term ''hidrosad\u00e9nite phlegmoneuse'' about 15 years later. This name for the disease reflects the former [[pathogenetic]] model of acne inversa, which is considered [[inflammation]] of sweat glands as the primary cause of hidradenitis suppurativa. In 1922, Schiefferdecker suspected a pathogenic association between acne inversa and apocrine sweat glands. In 1956 Pillsbury postulated follicular occlusion as the cause of acne inversa, which they grouped together with acne conglobata and perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens (dissecting cellulitis of the scalp) as the \"acne triad\". Plewig and Kligman added another element to their acne triad, [[pilonidal sinus]]. Plewig ''et al.'' noted that this new \"acne tetrad\" includes all the elements found in the original \"acne triad\", in addition to a fourth element, pilonidal sinus. In 1989, Plewig and Steger introduced the term \"acne inversa\", indicating a follicular source of the disease and replacing older terms such as \"Verneuil disease\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
