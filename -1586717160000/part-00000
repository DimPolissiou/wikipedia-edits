The steamship owner [[Henry Bell (engineer)|Henry Bell]] proposed building a canal from the Broomielaw to Glasgow Green with a quay terminal at the Green; this proposal was publicly condemned and never implemented. Large coal deposits were discovered under the Green, after borings performed in 1821 and 1822. Although the City's Superintendent of Work recommended mining, the town council voted against it.  However, later in 1858, when the city was looking to offset the cost of purchasing land for parks in other areas of the city, the council approved a plan to mine the Green. However, before the plan could be implemented, it met with large scale public opposition and was dropped, only for it to be resurrected in 1869 and 1888, each time failing to result in any mining.<ref name=\"GlasgowGuide\" />\n\n[[File:DoultonFountain-2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The Doulton Fountain]]\n[[Image:AM Jame Watt stone, Glasgow Green.JPG|thumb|right|Stone commemorating James Watt's inspiration.]]\nFrom 25 December 1745 to 3 January 1746, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie's]] army camped in the privately owned ''Flesher's Haugh'' (which would become a part of Glasgow Green in 1792), while Charlie demanded that the city equip his army with fresh clothing and footwear.<ref name=\"streetNamesGlasgow\" />\n\nIn 1765, [[James Watt]], while wandering aimlessly across the Green, conceived the idea of the separate condenser for the steam engine.<ref name=\"GlasgowGuide\" />  This invention is credited by some with starting the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n===19th century===\nTo alleviate economic depression in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Town Council of Glasgow employed 324 jobless workers to remodel Glasgow Green. The [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] movement for parliamentary reform grew, and in 1816 some 40,000 people attended a meeting on the Green to support demands for more representative government and an end to the [[Corn Laws]] which kept food prices high. In the spring of 1820 the Green was one of the meeting places for conspirators in what became the \"[[Radical War]]\", with strikers carrying out military drill on the Green before their brief rebellion was crushed.

The [[Chartism]] movement that grew in response to the Reform Act, later resulted in what is known as the ''Chartist Riot'' of 1848.  [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s [[Reform Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]], which increased the electorate to 230,606 (1868), brought further meetings to the Green.<ref name=\"GlasgowGuide\" />\n\nThe park was used as a meeting place by the women's [[suffragette]] movement from the early 1870s to the late 1910s.

Clydesdale ARC moved from the south side of the river to Glasgow Green in 1901.

On 29 June 1916, [[David Lloyd George]] was invited to receive the [[Freedom of the City]], which led to mass protests on the Green. In May 1917, workers marched through Glasgow to the Green in support of [[Russia]]'s [[February Revolution]]. Another result of World War I was increased migration to the city of munitions workers. The resulting rent increases led to protests on the Green in 1920.\n\nOver the years there have been many live music events on Glasgow Green. [[Michael Jackson]] performed there on 18 August 1992 during his ''[[Dangerous World Tour]]'' in front of 65,000 people, his only live show in [[Scotland]].

After repeated design proposals had been rejected by the city council, [[James Templeton & Co]] employed the architect [[William Leiper]], who designed a facade inspired by the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]]. On 1 November 1889, the factory facade collapsed due to insecure fixings and 29 women were killed in adjacent weaving sheds. The story is carved in a section of stone beneath the base of Templeton Gate, installed during refurbishment work to the area in 2005. A fire in the factory in 1900 resulted in more deaths.  The building was extended in the 1930s and in 1984 became the Templeton Business Centre. In 2005, the 1930s extension was demolished to make way for 143 new flats, part of a \u00a322 million regeneration project which saw the owners, [[Scottish Enterprise]], sell the Templeton Carpet Factory for \u00a36.7 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/sedotcom_home/news-se/news-fullarticle.htm?articleid=87807 |title=Sale of Glasgow landmark signals start of major redevelopment project |author=David Cannon |date=26 November 2004 |publisher=Scottish Enterprise |accessdate=27 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118203559/http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/sedotcom_home/news-se/news-fullarticle.htm?articleid=87807 |archivedate=18 January 2007 }}</ref>\n[[File:Glasgow Humane Society lifeboat station .jpg|thumb|Glasgow Humane Society lifeboat station & pontoon]]\n[[Image:AM William Collins fountain, Glasgow Green, at sunset.JPG|thumb|William Collins fountain in Glasgow Green]]\n\n===Fountains===\nIn 1881 a fountain was erected in the park to commemorate [[William Collins (Lord Provost)|Sir William Collins]], a figure in the [[temperance movement]] who served as Glasgow's [[Lord Provost]] between 1877 and 1880.<ref name=\"GlasgowGuide\" /> In 1992, the fountain was moved to stand behind the McLennan Arch.\n\nThe Doulton Fountain, given by Sir [[Henry Doulton]] to Glasgow as part of the [[International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry|International Exhibition of 1888]], was moved to the Green in 1890.<ref name=\"GlasgowGuide\" />  Designed by architect Arthur E. Pearce, the {{convert|46|ft|m|sing=on}} tall fountain was built by the [[Royal Doulton]] company to commemorate [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] reign.  It featured a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} basin, with a slightly larger than life-size statue of Queen Victoria, surrounded by four life-size statues of water-carriers representing [[Australasia]], [[Canada]], [[India]] and South Africa. A lightning strike in 1891 destroyed the statue of Victoria, and rather than let the city replace the statue with an urn, Doulton paid for a second hand-made statue to be produced. In the 1960s the fountain was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair with the water supply being turned off. However, in 2002 a \u00a32 million restoration programme was started that restored the fountain to its original condition. {{As of|2004}}, the fountain has been placed in a new location, in front of the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]].

This also creates the unusual system of two distinct ecosystems existing side by side, with the Clyde on the west side of the weir being saltwater, while it is fresh water on the east side (the park side).
