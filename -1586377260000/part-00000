In 2011, Nordic Games established a second office, Nordic Games GmbH, in [[Vienna]], Austria, and soon shifted its publishing operations to the new office.\n\nIn August 2016, Nordic Games, together with its Viennese office, was renamed [[THQ Nordic]], using the \"[[THQ]]\" [[trademark]] that it had acquired in 2014, and in November 2016, the company became a [[public company]] listed on [[Nasdaq First North]]. Throughout 2018, THQ Nordic acquired Koch Media Holding (parent of [[Koch Media]]) and Coffee Stain Holding (parent of [[Coffee Stain Studios]]), both of which operate independently under THQ Nordic, complementary to THQ Nordic GmbH.\n\nTo avoid confusion with THQ Nordic GmbH and to clarify its position as a holding company, THQ Nordic AB was renamed Embracer Group in September 2019, while THQ Nordic retained its name.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The original Nordic Games (1990s\u20132004) ===\nAt an early age, Swedish [[entrepreneur]] Lars Wingefors began successfully selling a diverse range of products, including Christmas magazines and plastic bags, and when he was 13 years old, he founded LW Comics, a company that sold second-hand [[comic books]].<ref name=\"Entrepren\u00f6r\">{{cite

The company was established under the name Nordic Games in December 2008, forming the [[video game publishing]] subsidiary of game retailer Game Outlet Europe. Co-founders include [[chief executive officer]] and Game Outlet Europe founder Lars Wingefors, Pelle Lundborg, and Nik Blower. In 2011, Nordic Games established a second office, Nordic Games GmbH, in [[Vienna]], Austria, and soon shifted its publishing operations to the new office.\n\nIn August 2016, Nordic Games, together with its Viennese office, was renamed [[THQ Nordic]], using the \"[[THQ]]\" [[trademark]] that it had acquired in 2014, and in November 2016, the company became a [[public company]] listed on [[Nasdaq First North]]. Throughout 2018, THQ Nordic acquired Koch Media Holding (parent of [[Koch Media]]) and Coffee Stain Holding (parent of [[Coffee Stain Studios]]), both of which operate independently under THQ Nordic, complementary to THQ Nordic GmbH.\n\nTo avoid confusion with THQ Nordic GmbH and to clarify its position as a holding company, THQ Nordic AB was renamed Embracer Group in September 2019, while THQ Nordic retained its name.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The original Nordic Games (1990s\u20132004) ===\nAt an early age, Swedish [[entrepreneur]] Lars Wingefors began successfully selling a diverse range of products, including Christmas magazines and plastic bags, and when he was 13 years old, he founded LW Comics, a company that sold second-hand [[comic books]].<ref name=\"Entrepren\u00f6r\">{{cite

As a member of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], he was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[East Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|East Tyrone]] from 1906 to 1910 at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. He joined the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, then on the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 enlisted for service in the [[British Army]], with which he was killed in action on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] in the Autumn of 1916. He was a much admired old comrade of [[James Joyce]],<ref>Joyce and Company By David Pierce (London:2006) p152</ref> who considered him to be his best friend in Ireland,<ref>Conor, Volume I: A Biography of Conor Cruise O'Brien: Volume I ..., Volume 2 By Donald Harman Akenson (Canada:1994) p49</ref> as well as the likes of [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] and [[Robert Wilson Lynd]].\n\nHe was one of the leading figures of the generation who at the turn of the twentieth century gave new intellectual life to Irish party politics, and to the constitutional movement towards All-Ireland Home Rule. A gifted speaker with an incisive mind and devastating wit, his death was regarded as a great loss to Ireland's political and intellectual life.<ref>''A Dictionary of Irish History since 1800'', D. J. Hickey & J. E. Doherty , Gill & MacMillan (1980)</ref>\n\nAs [[G. K.

One of his brothers was the industrial pioneer, [[Laurence Kettle]].\n\nAndrew Kettle influenced his son considerably through his political activities, having been involved from an early age in the constitutional movement to achieve [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule]]. Andrew joined [[Michael Davitt]] in the foundation of the Irish Land League and was one of the signatories of the \"No Rent Manifesto\". He had adhered to [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]] in the 1890 crisis, and stood for election as a nationalist candidate on several occasions.<ref>''[[Cork Examiner]]'', 25 September 1916: from [[Andrew Kettle]]'s obituary ([[Andrew Kettle|text in full in article on the latter]])</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThomas was raised in comfortable rural surroundings. Like his brothers he was educated at the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers' O'Connell School]] at Richmond Street, Dublin, where he excelled. In 1894 he went to study with the Jesuits at [[Clongowes Wood College]] in [[County Kildare]], known as a wit and a good debater. He enjoyed athletics, cricket and cycling and attained honours in English and French when leaving.[[File:Thomas M. Kettle as a student at Clongowes Wood College.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas M. Kettle as a student at Clongowes Wood College]]\n\nEntering [[University College Dublin]] in 1897, he was regarded as a charismatic student. Surrounded by ambitious and politically minded young men he quickly established himself as a leading student politician and a brilliant scholar. He was elected to the prestigious position of auditor of the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]], 1898\u20131899. His friends and contemporaries at UCD included [[Hugh Kennedy]], [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] and [[James Joyce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/j/Joyce_JA/notes/People/notes1.htm|title=James Joyce: Notes (6) - PeSkeleton bibliography in \"Shakespeare and Company\" > Appendix - as attachedople in Joyce [II]: Contemps. et al|website=Ricorso.net|accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nTom Kettle distributed pro-[[Boer]] leaflets during the early months of the [[South Africa]]n [[Second Boer War]], and protested against the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] production of [[W.B. Yeats|Yeats]]' ''[[The Countess Cathleen]]'' in 1899 over its irreligious story of an unlikely kind-hearted aristocrat who sells her soul to save her tenants. Due to illness he interrupted his studies in 1900, his health always being fragile. He went abroad to renew his spirits by travelling on the continent, improving his German and French. Returning to Dublin he renewed his studies, and in 1902 took a BA in mental and moral science. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Journalism==\nHe then read law after admission to the [[King's Inns|Irish Law bar]] in 1903, qualifying as a [[barrister]] in 1905. He practiced sporadically, devoting most of his time to political journalism. He maintained his contacts to University College and his fellow students, participating in debates, contributing to and becoming editor of the college newspaper. He helped to found the Cui Bono Club, a discussion group for recent graduates.\n\nA vocal supporter of the [[Home Rule]]-seeking [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), Kettle strengthened his links with the constitutional movement by co-founding and becoming president of the Young Ireland Branch of the [[United Irish League]] in 1904.  He attracted the attention of the Irish Party leader [[John Redmond]]. Kettle declined the offer to stand for a parliamentary seat, instead edited a newspaper, ''The Nationist'', an unconventional weekly journal. The paper pursued an extreme pro-Irish Party line, at the same time reflecting Kettle's liberal and often controversial views on a wide range of topics, education, women's rights, the [[Celtic Revival|Irish Literary Revival]]. He resigned his editorship in 1905 on the grounds of a controversy about an allegedly anti-clerical article.\n\n==Parliamentarian==\nAfter the death in 1906 of [[Patrick Doogan]], the MP for [[East Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|East Tyrone]], Kettle accepted the candidature for the vacant parliamentary seat at [[1906 East Tyrone by-election|the resulting by-election]]. He won the seat by a narrow majority of 18 votes, becoming one of the few young men to gain admission to the aging Irish Party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], during the first two decades of the twentieth century.\n\nLauded as a future party leader, in late 1906 he went to America, participating in a number of propaganda and fund-raising meetings. In the House of Commons at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] he was renowned as an amusing and often caustic speaker, as a staunch supporter of the Irish Party and its constitutional path to [[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]], also engaging in debates for the provision of higher education for Irish [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]s and on Ireland's economic condition.\n\nHe was deeply steeped in European culture. Kettle's ideal was an Ireland identified with the life of Europe. In ''\"Ireland\"'' he wrote,\"My only programme for Ireland consists in equal parts of Home Rule and the Ten Commandments. My only counsel to Ireland is, that to become deeply Irish, she must become European.\"<ref>''The Ways of War'', Memoir p.4, Mary (Sheehy) Kettle,  T. M. Kettle.</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\n[[File:Thomas Michael Kettle.jpg|thumb|Thomas Michael Kettle]]In 1908 he was the first Professor of National Economics at [[University College Dublin]], a constituent college of the new National University of Ireland. One of its liveliest spirits and increasingly busy and in demand as a speaker, he had difficulty combining academic work with his work as an MP. He was a popular professor and his genuine interest in economics reflected in a number of publications concerning financial issues. He was friends with [[Thomas MacDonagh]], and wrote for his magazine ''The Irish Review''. In 1911, he helped to establish the Legal & Economic Society of the university along with his fellow professor [[J.G. Swift MacNeill]]. In September 1909 he married Mary Sheehy, a fellow graduate who had been the muse of the adolescent James Joyce and is the model for the lead female character in Joyce's story [[Araby (short story)|Araby]] from his collection [[Dubliners]], as well as Miss Ivors in his story [[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]] from the same collection.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bD6Lstgd2CIC&pg=PA307&lpg=PA307&dq=%22mary+sheehy%22+araby#v=onepage&q=%22mary+sheehy%22+araby&f=false|title=Joyce, Bakhtin, and Popular Literature: Chronicles of Disorder|first=R.

Even though out of parliament he remained an active IPP member publishing a number of essays reiterating his support for attaining Home Rule by constitutional means. He enthusiastically greeted the 1912 [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]], likewise the removal of the veto power of the [[House of Lords|Lords]], this veto being the last obstacle to Home Rule. On the other hand, he brusquely dismissed [[Irish Unionist Party|Unionist]] fears of the bill's possible effects, giving the cause of Home Rule prevalence before all other considerations. On January 12, 1912, he gave a talk to the National Liberal Club's Political and Economic Circle.\n\n==1913-1914==\nDuring the 1913 [[Dublin Lockout|Dublin strike and lockout]], unlike other contemporary upper-class commentators, Kettle supported the locked out workers and published a series of articles which revealed the terrible living and working conditions of Dublin's poor, and was involved in the formation of a peace committee which endeavoured to negotiate a settlement between workers and employers.\n\nIn 1913 Kettle also became involved with the [[paramilitary]] [[Irish Volunteers]], a new Irish Nationalist [[militia]] that formed in response to the creation in the north of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] by [[Edward Carson]] to oppose the creation of an all-Ireland government based in Dublin via the passage in the British Parliament in London of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]]. In July 1914 he left Dublin and travelled to [[Belgium]] on behalf of the Irish Volunteers seeking to purchase rifles and ammunition for the organization's armoury.<ref>Profile of Kettle, 'Voices of World War 1' series, [[BBC]] website (2019). https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2sPPfFnV46bMVPj7ShDY0pV/tom-kettle</ref> Whilst he was in Belgium [[World War 1]] broke out, and, finding this more interesting than militia arms procurement, he became an on the scene [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'', reporting on the opening moves of the armies of the [[II Reich]] as they marched Westwards. Travelling throughout [[Flanders]] in August and September 1914, he became increasingly alarmed by the punitive measures that he witnessed being implemented against the Belgian civilian population by the [[Imperial German Army]] against even the lightest civil resistance to the passage of its troop columns moving through that country heading into France.<ref>''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' (1999) (2001) John Horne and Alan Kramer of [[Dublin University|D.U.]], [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-10791-9}}. <br> Detailed researched account of German atrocities perpetrated on the Belgian and French civilian population in autumn 1914.<br> Winner of the Fraenkel Prize for Contemporary History in 2000</ref> Kettle perceived at this moment a threat to Europe's liberty from the nature of the II Reich, and began dispatching war reports from the [[Brussels]] warning against the dire threat to Europe from [[Prussia]]n militarism, depicting the conflict as \"A war of Civilization vs Barbarianism\".<ref>''The Ways of War'', \"Why Ireland fought\" p. 72, T. M. Kettle.</ref>\n\n==World War 1==\nWith [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland having become embroiled in the Great War]] Kettle returned to Dublin. On arrival back home he sided with the [[National Volunteers]] in a split within the [[Irish Volunteers]] nationalist militia's ranks between those for whom Irish independence was all, and were increasingly eying the possibility an armed confrontation with the British Government (with the threat of an armed insurrection against Irish Nationalism from Ulster having abated with the [[Ulster Volunteers]] having enlisted en masse into the British Army to fight in World War 1), and those who followed [[John Redmond|John Redmond's]] constitutional lead in accepting the [[Government of the United Kingdom]]'s public undertaking of a restoration of self-government to Ireland in its domestic affairs, temporarily deferred until the war's end, and who were also concerned about matters beyond Ireland's shores with Europe's future in the 20th Century now being decided.<ref>'Thomas Michael Kettle: An enduring legacy', 'Irish Times', 18 May 2016. https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/thomas-michael-kettle-an-enduring-legacy-1.2640866</ref>\n\nIn consequence Kettle volunteered for active service with the 7th Battalion of the [[Leinster Regiment]],<ref>Bromyard News and Record, 28 January 1915</ref> but was refused on the grounds of fragile health. He subsequently received a commission into the [[British Army]] with the rank of [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]], restricted to garrison service at home.\n\nHe applied to be an [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] candidate for a by-election in [[East Galway (UK Parliament constituency)|East Galway]], and though not selected his support for the party did not abate, continuing to advocate both home rule and voluntary enlistment with the British Arms, maintaining that Irishmen had a moral duty to join the [[Allies of World War I|allied stand]] against the displayed tyranny on the European continent of the II Reich. He asserted that \"Having broken like an armed burglar into Belgium, Germany was thereby guilty of a systematic campaign of murder, pillage, outrage, and destruction, planned and ordered by her military and intellectual leaders.\"<ref>''The Ways of War'' \"Why Ireland fought\" p. 69, T. M. Kettle</ref>\n\nBy 1916 Kettle had published more than ten books and pamphlets, contributed numerous articles to journals and newspapers on Irish politics, literary reviews, poetry and essays, philosophical treatises and translations from German and French. Although at times melancholy at the war's immense escalating intensity across Europe, consuming ever more men and causing destruction to its nations, he continued to apply to be sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on active service, until, with his health somewhat improved, he received a commission into the 9th Battalion of the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]], amidst the [[16th (Irish) Division]], which in early 1916 he went to France with, serving alongside [[Emmet Dalton]], a 19 year old [[subaltern]], whose family Kettle had known and frequented the Dublin home of pre-war.<ref>'Emmet Dalton Remembers', (1978) [[RTE]] television documentary. https://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1011-ireland-and-the-great-war/1016-easter-rising/315378-emmet-dalton-remembers/</ref><ref>[http://www.turtlebunbury.com Turtle Bunbury], ''The Glorious Madness, Tales of The Irish and The Great War'', Tom Kettle and Emmet Dalton; <br> Mad Guns and Invisible Wands, p.105, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 12 (2014) {{ISBN|978 0717 16234 5}}</ref>\n\nThe conditions in the trenches of the Western Front broke his health again, and he returned to Dublin shortly after the failure of the abortive [[Easter Rising|Easter Revolution]] on sick leave, seeing the wreckage of the city's centre caused by the fighting that had occurred there.

On leaving Ireland on 14 July 1916 he predicted that the Easter Revolutionaries of 1916 would be lionized as patriots in the near future of Ireland's history, whilst those who had fought with the British Arms in World War 1 would be condemned. Kettle was angered by actions of the Revolutionary faction that had staged the failed revolt, feeling that they were marring Constitutional Nationalism's long worked for strategy of the rebirth of a sovereign Irish state finding its place amidst the nations in a civilized fashion, with good spirit amidst its neighbours of the [[British Isles]].<ref>The Enigma of Tom Kettle by John Benignus Lyons</ref>\n[[File:Thomas M. Kettle memorial in St. Stephen's Green park, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Thomas Kettle Memorial]]\nIt was as an Irish soldier in a war in the defence of European civilisation that he entered the war. He was deeply steeped in Europe's cultures. Kettle's ambition for Ireland in the 20th century was a land and culture with the European continent as its polestar. He wrote: \"My only programme for Ireland consists in equal parts of Home Rule and the Ten Commandments.

As a member of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], he was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[East Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|East Tyrone]] from 1906 to 1910 at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. He joined the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, then on the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 enlisted for service in the [[British Army]], with which he was killed in action on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] in the Autumn of 1916. He was a much admired old comrade of [[James Joyce]],<ref>Joyce and Company By David Pierce (London:2006) p152</ref> who considered him to be his best friend in Ireland,<ref>Conor, Volume I: A Biography of Conor Cruise O'Brien: Volume I ..., Volume 2 By Donald Harman Akenson (Canada:1994) p49</ref> as well as the likes of [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] and [[Robert Wilson Lynd]].\n\nHe was one of the leading figures of the generation who at the turn of the twentieth century gave new intellectual life to Irish party politics, and to the constitutional movement towards All-Ireland Home Rule. A gifted speaker with an incisive mind and devastating wit, his death was regarded as a great loss to Ireland's political and intellectual life.<ref>''A Dictionary of Irish History since 1800'', D.

One of his brothers was the industrial pioneer, [[Laurence Kettle]].\n\nAndrew Kettle influenced his son considerably through his political activities, having been involved from an early age in the constitutional movement to achieve [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule]]. Andrew joined [[Michael Davitt]] in the foundation of the Irish Land League and was one of the signatories of the \"No Rent Manifesto\". He had adhered to [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]] in the 1890 crisis, and stood for election as a nationalist candidate on several occasions.<ref>''[[Cork Examiner]]'', 25 September 1916: from [[Andrew Kettle]]'s obituary ([[Andrew Kettle|text in full in article on the latter]])</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThomas was raised in comfortable rural surroundings. Like his brothers he was educated at the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers' O'Connell School]] at Richmond Street, Dublin, where he excelled. In 1894 he went to study with the Jesuits at [[Clongowes Wood College]] in [[County Kildare]], known as a wit and a good debater. He enjoyed athletics, cricket and cycling and attained honours in English and French when leaving.[[File:Thomas M. Kettle as a student at Clongowes Wood College.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas M. Kettle as a student at Clongowes Wood College]]\n\nEntering [[University College Dublin]] in 1897, he was regarded as a charismatic student. Surrounded by ambitious and politically minded young men he quickly established himself as a leading student politician and a brilliant scholar. He was elected to the prestigious position of auditor of the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]], 1898-1899. His friends and contemporaries at UCD included [[Hugh Kennedy]], [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] and [[James Joyce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/j/Joyce_JA/notes/People/notes1.htm|title=James Joyce: Notes (6) - PeSkeleton bibliography in \"Shakespeare and Company\" > Appendix - as attachedople in Joyce [II]: Contemps. et al|website=Ricorso.net|accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nTom Kettle distributed pro-[[Boer]] leaflets during the early months of the [[South Africa]]n [[Second Boer War]], and protested against the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] production of [[W.B. Yeats|Yeats]]' ''[[The Countess Cathleen]]'' in 1899 over its irreligious story of an unlikely kind-hearted aristocrat who sells her soul to save her tenants. Due to illness he interrupted his studies in 1900, his health always being fragile. He went abroad to renew his spirits by travelling on the continent, improving his German and French. Returning to Dublin he renewed his studies, and in 1902 took a BA in mental and moral science. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Journalism==\nHe then read law after admission to the [[King's Inns|Irish Law bar]] in 1903, qualifying as a [[barrister]] in 1905. He practiced sporadically, devoting most of his time to political journalism. He maintained his contacts to University College and his fellow students, participating in debates, contributing to and becoming editor of the college newspaper. He helped to found the Cui Bono Club, a discussion group for recent graduates.\n\nA vocal supporter of the [[Home Rule]]-seeking [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), Kettle strengthened his links with the constitutional movement by co-founding and becoming president of the Young Ireland Branch of the [[United Irish League]] in 1904.  He attracted the attention of the Irish Party leader [[John Redmond]]. Kettle declined the offer to stand for a parliamentary seat, instead edited a newspaper, ''The Nationist'', an unconventional weekly journal. The paper pursued an extreme pro-Irish Party line, at the same time reflecting Kettle\u2019s liberal and often controversial views on a wide range of topics, education, women\u2019s rights, the [[Celtic Revival|Irish Literary Revival]]. He resigned his editorship in 1905 on the grounds of a controversy about an allegedly anti-clerical article.\n\n==Parliamentarian==\nAfter the death in 1906 of [[Patrick Doogan]], the MP for [[East Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|East Tyrone]], Kettle accepted the candidature for the vacant parliamentary seat at [[1906 East Tyrone by-election|the resulting by-election]]. He won the seat by a narrow majority of 18 votes, becoming one of the few young men to gain admission to the aging Irish Party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], during the first two decades of the twentieth century.\n\nLauded as a future party leader, in late 1906 he went to America, participating in a number of propaganda and fund-raising meetings. In the House of Commons at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] he was renowned as an amusing and often caustic speaker, as a staunch supporter of the Irish Party and its constitutional path to [[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]], also engaging in debates for the provision of higher education for Irish [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]s and on Ireland's economic condition.\n\nHe was deeply steeped in European culture. Kettle's ideal was an Ireland identified with the life of Europe. In ''\"Ireland\"'' he wrote,\"My only programme for Ireland consists in equal parts of Home Rule and the Ten Commandments. My only counsel to Ireland is, that to become deeply Irish, she must become European.\"<ref>''The Ways of War'', Memoir p.4, Mary (Sheehy) Kettle,  T. M. Kettle.</ref>\n\n==Academic career==\n[[File:Thomas Michael Kettle.jpg|thumb|Thomas Michael Kettle]]In 1908 he was the first Professor of National Economics at [[University College Dublin]], a constituent college of the new National University of Ireland. One of its liveliest spirits and increasingly busy and in demand as a speaker, he had difficulty combining academic work with his work as an MP. He was a popular professor and his genuine interest in economics reflected in a number of publications concerning financial issues. He was friends with [[Thomas MacDonagh]], and wrote for his magazine ''The Irish Review''. In 1911, he helped to establish the Legal & Economic Society of the university along with his fellow professor [[J.G. Swift MacNeill]]. In September 1909 he married Mary Sheehy, a fellow graduate who had been the muse of the adolescent James Joyce and is the model for the lead female character in Joyce's story [[Araby (short story)|Araby]] from his collection [[Dubliners]], as well as Miss Ivors in his story [[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]] from the same collection.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bD6Lstgd2CIC&pg=PA307&lpg=PA307&dq=%22mary+sheehy%22+araby#v=onepage&q=%22mary+sheehy%22+araby&f=false|title=Joyce, Bakhtin, and Popular Literature: Chronicles of Disorder|first=R.

Even though out of parliament he remained an active IPP member publishing a number of essays reiterating his support for attaining Home Rule by constitutional means. He enthusiastically greeted the 1912 [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]], likewise the removal of the veto power of the [[House of Lords|Lords]], this veto being the last obstacle to Home Rule. On the other hand, he brusquely dismissed [[Irish Unionist Party|Unionist]] fears of the bill\u2019s possible effects, giving the cause of Home Rule prevalence before all other considerations. On January 12, 1912, he gave a talk to the National Liberal Club's Political and Economic Circle.\n\n==1913-1914==\nDuring the 1913 [[Dublin Lockout|Dublin strike and lockout]], unlike other contemporary upper-class commentators, Kettle supported the locked out workers and published a series of articles which revealed the terrible living and working conditions of Dublin\u2019s poor, and was involved in the formation of a peace committee which endeavoured to negotiate a settlement between workers and employers.\n\nIn 1913 Kettle also became involved with the [[paramilitary]] [[Irish Volunteers]], a new Irish Nationalist [[militia]] that formed in response to the creation in the north of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] by [[Edward Carson]] to oppose the creation of an all-Ireland government based in Dublin via the passage in the British Parliament in London of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]]. In July 1914 he left Dublin and travelled to [[Belgium]] on behalf of the Irish Volunteers seeking to purchase rifles and ammunition for the organization's armoury.<ref>Profile of Kettle, 'Voices of World War 1' series, [[BBC]] website (2019). https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2sPPfFnV46bMVPj7ShDY0pV/tom-kettle</ref> Whilst he was in Belgium [[World War 1]] broke out, and, finding this more interesting than militia arms procurement, he became an on the scene [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'', reporting on the opening moves of the armies of the [[II Reich]] as they marched Westwards. Travelling throughout [[Flanders]] in August and September 1914, he became increasingly alarmed by the punitive measures that he witnessed being implemented against the Belgian civilian population by the [[Imperial German Army]] against even the lightest civil resistance to the passage of its troop columns moving through that country heading into France.<ref>''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' (1999) (2001) John Horne and Alan Kramer of [[Dublin University|D.U.]], [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-10791-9}}. <br> Detailed researched account of German atrocities perpetrated on the Belgian and French civilian population in autumn 1914.<br> Winner of the Fraenkel Prize for Contemporary History in 2000</ref> Kettle perceived at this moment a threat to Europe's liberty from the nature of the II Reich, and began dispatching war reports from the [[Brussels]] warning against the dire threat to Europe from [[Prussia]]n militarism, depicting the conflict as \"A war of Civilization vs Barbarianism\".<ref>''The Ways of War'', \"Why Ireland fought\" p. 72, T.

On arrival back home he sided with the [[National Volunteers]] in a split within the [[Irish Volunteers]] nationalist militia's ranks between those for whom Irish independence was all, and were increasingly eying the possibility an armed confrontation with the British Government (with the threat of an armed insurrection against Irish Nationalism from Ulster having abated with the [[Ulster Volunteers]] having enlisted en masse into the British Army to fight in World War 1), and those who followed [[John Redmond|John Redmond's]] constitutional lead in accepting the [[Government of the United Kingdom]]'s public undertaking of a restoration of self-government to Ireland in its domestic affairs, temporarily deferred until the war's end, and who were also concerned about matters beyond Ireland's shores with Europe's future in the 20th Century now being decided.<ref>'Thomas Michael Kettle: An enduring legacy', 'Irish Times', 18 May 2016. https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/thomas-michael-kettle-an-enduring-legacy-1.2640866</ref>\n\nIn consequence Kettle volunteered for active service with the 7th Battalion of the [[Leinster Regiment]],<ref>Bromyard News and Record, 28 January 1915</ref> but was refused on the grounds of fragile health. He subsequently received a commission into the [[British Army]] with the rank of [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]], restricted to garrison service at home.\n\nHe applied to be an [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] candidate for a by-election in [[East Galway (UK Parliament constituency)|East Galway]], and though not selected his support for the party did not abate, continuing to advocate both home rule and voluntary enlistment with the British Arms, maintaining that Irishmen had a moral duty to join the [[Allies of World War I|allied stand]] against the displayed tyranny on the European continent of the II Reich. He asserted that \"Having broken like an armed burglar into Belgium, Germany was thereby guilty of a systematic campaign of murder, pillage, outrage, and destruction, planned and ordered by her military and intellectual leaders.\"<ref>''The Ways of War'' \"Why Ireland fought\" p. 69, T. M. Kettle</ref>\n\nBy 1916 Kettle had published more than ten books and pamphlets, contributed numerous articles to journals and newspapers on Irish politics, literary reviews, poetry and essays, philosophical treatises and translations from German and French. Although at times melancholy at the war's immense escalating intensity across Europe, consuming ever more men and causing destruction to its nations, he continued to apply to be sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on active service, until, with his health somewhat improved, he received a commission into the 9th Battalion of the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]], amidst the [[16th (Irish) Division]], which in early 1916 he went to France with, serving alongside [[Emmet Dalton]], a 19 year old [[subaltern]], whose family Kettle had known and frequented the Dublin home of pre-war.<ref>'Emmet Dalton Remembers', (1978) [[RTE]] television documentary. https://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1011-ireland-and-the-great-war/1016-easter-rising/315378-emmet-dalton-remembers/</ref><ref>[http://www.turtlebunbury.com Turtle Bunbury], ''The Glorious Madness, Tales of The Irish and The Great War'', Tom Kettle and Emmet Dalton; <br> Mad Guns and Invisible Wands, p.105, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 12 (2014) {{ISBN|978 0717 16234 5}}</ref>\n\nThe conditions in the trenches of the Western Front broke his health again, and he returned to Dublin shortly after the failure of the abortive [[Easter Rising|Easter Revolution]] on sick leave, seeing the wreckage of the city's centre caused by the fighting that had occurred there. He was also beginning to rely too heavily on alcohol in this period as a psychological palliative to the stress of military active service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishdemocrat.co.uk/book-reviews/thomas-kettle/|title=Thomas Kettle (Life and Times)|author=David Granville|website=Irishdemocrat.co.uk|accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref> Whilst in Dublin he rejected offers of a permanent staff position, and returned to rejoin the Battalion in the line. On leaving Ireland on 14 July 1916 he predicted that the Easter Revolutionaries of 1916 would be lionized as patriots in the near future of Ireland's history, whilst those who had fought with the British Arms in World War 1 would be condemned. Kettle was angered by actions of the Revolutionary faction that had staged the failed revolt, feeling that they were marring Constitutional Nationalism's long worked for strategy of the rebirth of a sovereign Irish state finding its place amidst the nations in a civilized fashion, with good spirit amidst its neighbours of the [[British Isles]].<ref>The Enigma of Tom Kettle by John Benignus Lyons</ref>\n[[File:Thomas M. Kettle memorial in St. Stephen's Green park, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Thomas Kettle Memorial]]\nIt was as an Irish soldier in a war in the defence of European civilisation that he entered the war. He was deeply steeped in Europe's cultures. Kettle\u2019s ambition for Ireland in the 20th century was a land and culture with the European continent as its polestar. He wrote: \"My only programme for Ireland consists in equal parts of Home Rule and the Ten Commandments. My only counsel to Ireland is, that to become deeply Irish, she must become European\";<ref>''The Ways of War'' Memoir, pp. 3, 4, Mary (Sheehy) Kettle</ref> and later, \"Used with the wisdom that is sown in tears and blood, this tragedy of Europe may be and must be the prologue to the two reconciliations of which all statesmen have dreamed, the reconciliation of Protestant Ulster with Ireland, and the reconciliation of Ireland with Great Britain.\"<ref>''The Ways of War'' \"Why Ireland fought\" p. 71, T. M. Kettle</ref>\n\nIn a letter, sent to his friend [[Joseph Devlin]] from France shortly before his death, Kettle wrote: \"I hope to come back. If not, I believe that to sleep here in the France that I have loved is no harsh fate, and that so passing out into silence, I shall help towards the Irish settlement. Give my love to my colleagues \u2013 the Irish people have no need of it.\"<ref>''The Ways of War''  Memoir p. 34, Mary (Sheehy) Kettle</ref>\n\n==Death==\nKettle was killed in action with 'B' Company of the 9th Battalion of the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] in an attack on German lines on 9 September 1916, near the village of [[Battle of Ginchy|Ginchy]] during the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme Offensive]] in France.

He best known as a long-serving and controversial [[Home Secretary]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s Second Government from 1924 to 1929. He gained a reputation for strict [[authoritarianism]], opposing Communism and clamping down on nightclubs and what he saw as indecent literature. He also played an important role in the fight against the introduction of the Church of England [[Book of Common Prayer (1928)|Revised Prayer Book]], and in lowering the voting age for women from 30 to 21.\n\n==Early life and career==\n===Background and early life===\nWilliam Hicks, as he was initially called, was born in Canonbury, London on 23 June 1865.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\">Matthew 2004, p38</ref> He was the eldest of four sons and two daughters of Henry Hicks, of Plaistow Hall, [[Kent]], and his wife Harriett, daughter of William Watts. Hicks was a prosperous merchant and senior evangelical Anglican layman<ref>{{cite book |title=The Protestant Face of Anglicanism |author=Paul Zahl |publisher=Wm. B.

Her father was also a Manchester evangelical Tory. They were married on 12 June 1895. In 1896 he added his wife's name \"Joynson\" to his surname.<ref>[[#Blythe|Blythe]], p. 23</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n===Early attempts to enter Parliament===\nHe joined the Conservative Party (at that time part of the Unionist coalition, which name it retained until 1925) and was selected as a Conservative Parliamentary candidate in 1898. He unsuccessfully contested seats in [[Manchester]] in the general elections of [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900]] and [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]], losing to [[Winston Churchill]]. On the latter occasion, he made [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] speeches. At the time, there was an influx of Russian Jews fleeing from [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]], which had caused [[Arthur Balfour]]'s government to pass the [[Aliens Act 1905]]).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n===Motoring expert===\nJoynson-Hicks was an early authority on transport law, particularly motoring law. In 1906 he published \"The Law of Heavy and Light Mechanical Traction on Highways\". He was beginning to acquire a reputation as an evangelical lawyer with a perhaps paradoxical interest in the latest technology: motor cars (of which he owned several), telephones and aircraft.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nIn 1907 he became Chairman of the Motor Union, and presided over the merger with [[The Automobile Association]] in 1911, serving as chairman of the merged body until 1922.<ref name = \"Taylor29-30\"/><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/> One of his first actions was to assert the legality of AA patrols warning motorists of police [[speed trap]]s.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nHe was also President of the Lancashire Commercial Motor Users\u2019 Association of the National [[Threshing machine|Threshing Machine]] Owners\u2019 Association, and of the National [[Traction engine|Traction Engine]] Association.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nHe was also Treasurer of the [[Zenana Bible and Medical Mission]] and a member of the finance committee of the [[YMCA]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n==1908 by-election==\nJoynson-Hicks was elected to Parliament in a [[by-election]] in 1908, when [[Winston Churchill]] was obliged to submit to re-election in [[Manchester North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester North West]] after his appointment as [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]], as the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1908]] required newly appointed [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] ministers to [[Ministerial by-election|re-contest their seats]]. Cabinet ministers were normally returned unopposed, but as Churchill had [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from the Conservatives to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, the Conservatives were disinclined to allow him an uncontested return.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n[[Ronald Blythe]] in \"The Salutary Tale of Jix\" in ''The Age of Illusion'' (1963) called it \"the most brilliant, entertaining and hilarious electoral fight of the century\". Joynson-Hicks' nickname \"Jix\" dates from this by-election.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/> The election was notable for both the attacks of the [[Suffragette]] movement on Churchill, over his refusal to support legislation that would give women the vote, and [[Jew]]ish hostility to Joynson-Hicks over his support for the controversial [[Aliens Act 1905|Aliens Act]] which aimed to restrict Jewish immigration.<ref name = \"Addison1993\">[[Paul Addison]], ''Churchill on the Home Front 1900\u20131955'' (2nd ed., London 1993) p. 64</ref> Joynson-Hicks called Labour leader [[Keir Hardie]] \"a leprous traitor\" who wanted to sweep away the [[Ten Commandments]]. This prompted [[H G Wells]] to send an open letter to Labour sympathisers in Manchester,<ref>although an [[Social Democratic Federation|SDF]] candidate obtained a modest vote at the by-election, there was no official Labour Party candidate at this or any previous election for the seat; Labour supporters were therefore encouraged to vote Liberal in accordance with the [[Gladstone-MacDonald pact]]</ref> saying that Joynson-Hicks \"represents absolutely the worst element in British political life \u2026 an entirely undistinguished man \u2026 and an obscure and ineffectual nobody\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks defeated Churchill. This provoked a strong reaction across the country with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' running the front-page headline \"Winston Churchill is OUT! OUT! OUT!\" (Churchill shortly returned to Parliament as MP for [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]]).<ref name = \"Addison1993\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks gained personal notoriety in the immediate aftermath of this election for an address to his Jewish hosts at a dinner given by the [[Maccabaeans|Maccabean Society]], during which he said \"he had beaten them all thoroughly and soundly and was no longer their servant.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=W.

Cesarani cautioned that \"although he may have been nicknamed \"[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] Minor\", Jix was no fascist.\"<ref>David Cesarani, \"Joynson-Hicks and the Radical Right in England after the First World War\" in Tony Kushner and Kenneth Lunn (eds.) ''[[Traditions of Intolerance|Traditions of Intolerance: Historical Perspectives on Fascism and Race Discourse in Britain]]'' (Manchester 1989) pp.&nbsp;118\u2013139, p. 134</ref> Other work has disputed the notion that Joynson-Hicks was an anti-Semite, most notably a major article by [[W. D. Rubinstein|W.D. Rubinstein]] which asserted that as Home Secretary Joynson-Hicks would later allow more Jews to be [[naturalised]] than any other holder of that office.<ref>Rubinstein \"Recent Anglo-Jewish Historiography\", ''Australian Journal of Jewish Studies'' 7 (1993) part one in 7:1 pp.&nbsp;41\u201370, part two in 7:2 pp.&nbsp;24\u201345</ref> Whether or not it was justified, the notion that Joynson-Hicks was an anti-Semite played a large part in his portrayal as a narrow-minded and intolerant man, most obviously in the work of Ronald Blythe.<ref>[[#Blythe|Blythe]], p. 27</ref>\n\n==Early Parliamentary career==\nJoynson-Hicks lost his seat in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]]. He contested [[Sunderland (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland]] in the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|second general election in December that year]], but was again defeated. He was returned unopposed for [[Brentford (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentford]] at a [[1911 Brentford by-election|by-election in March 1911]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nOn 12 May 1915, he presented a petition to the Commons demanding the internment of enemy aliens of military age and the withdrawal from coastal areas of all enemy aliens.<ref>Meeting the Enemy by Richard van Emden</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], he formed a [[Pals battalion]] within the [[Middlesex Regiment]], the \"[[The Football Battalion|Football Battalion]].\" He acquired a reputation as a well-informed backbencher, an expert on aircraft and motors, badgering ministers about matters of aircraft design and production and methods of attacking [[Zeppelin]]s. In 1916 he published a pamphlet ''The Command of the Air'' in which he advocated indiscriminate bombing of civilians in German cities, including Berlin. However, he was not offered a government post.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\">Matthew 2004, p39</ref>\n\nIn [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], his old constituency having been abolished, he became MP for [[Twickenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Twickenham]], holding the seat until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1929.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nFor his war work, he was created a [[Baronet]], of [[Holmbury]] in the [[Surrey|County of Surrey]], in 1919.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 31587 |date= 7 October 1919 |page=12418 |city= London }}</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n==The Lloyd George Coalition==\nIn 1919-20 he went on an extended visit to the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[India]], which changed his political fortunes. At the time, there was considerable unrest in India and a rapid growth in the Home Rule movement, something Joynson-Hicks opposed due to the great economic importance of the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]] to Britain. He at one time had commented \"I know it is frequently said at missionary meetings that we conquered India to raise the level of the Indians. That is cant. We hold it as the finest outlet for British goods in general, and for Lancashire cotton goods in particular.\"<ref>Quoted in [[#Blythe|Blythe]], pp.&nbsp;27\u201328</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nHe emerged as a strong supporter of General [[Reginald Dyer]] over the [[Amritsar Massacre]], and nearly forced the resignation of the [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Edwin Montagu]], over the motion of censure the government put down concerning Dyer's actions.<ref>Cesarani p. 123 (he wrongly credits this campaign with toppling Montagu, who in fact stayed in office until the Lloyd George coalition fell in 1922)</ref> This episode established his reputation as one of the \"die-hards\" on the [[right-wing]] of the party, and he emerged as a strong critic of the party's participation in a [[coalition]] government with the Liberal [[David Lloyd George]].\n\nAs part of this campaign, he led an abortive attempt to block [[Austen Chamberlain]]'s nomination as leader of the Unionist party on [[Bonar Law]]'s retirement, putting forward [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]] instead with the express aim of \"splitting the coalition\".<ref>[[Max Aitken]], ''Decline and Fall of Lloyd George: and great was the fall thereof'' (London 1963) p. 21</ref>\n\n==Entering government==\nJoynson-Hicks played a small role in the fall of Lloyd George Coalition, which he had so disliked, in October 1922. The refusal of many leading Conservatives, who had been supporters of the Coalition, to serve in [[Bonar Law]]'s new government opened up promotion prospects. Joynson-Hicks was appointed [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]] (a junior minister, effectively deputy to the [[President of the Board of Trade]]). In the fifteen-month Conservative administration of first [[Bonar Law]] and then [[Stanley Baldwin]], Joynson-Hicks was rapidly promoted. In March 1923, he became [[Paymaster-General]] then [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], filling positions left vacant by the promotion of [[Neville Chamberlain]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nWhen [[Stanley Baldwin]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in May 1923, he initially also retained his previous position of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] whilst searching for a permanent successor. To relieve the burden of this position, he promoted Joynson-Hicks to [[Secretary to the Treasury|Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] and included him in the Cabinet.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nIn that role, Joynson-Hicks was responsible for making the ''[[Hansard]]'' statement, on 19 July 1923, that the [[Inland Revenue]] would not prosecute a defaulting taxpayer who made a full confession and paid the outstanding tax, interest and penalties. Joynson-Hicks had hopes of eventually becoming Chancellor himself, but instead Neville Chamberlain was appointed to the post in August 1923. Once more, Joynson-Hicks filled the gap left by Chamberlain's promotion, serving as [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]]. He became a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] in 1923.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 32809 |date= 27 March 1923 |page=2303 |city= London }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[hung parliament]], amounting to a Unionist defeat in the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|general election of December 1923]], Joynson-Hicks became a key figure in various intra-party attempts to oust Baldwin. At one time, the possibility of his becoming leader himself was discussed, but it seems to have been quickly discarded. He was involved in a plot to persuade [[Arthur Balfour]] that should the King seek his advice on whom to appoint Prime Minister, Balfour would advise him to appoint Austen Chamberlain or [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] Prime Minister instead of Labour leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. The plot failed when Balfour refused to countenance such a move and the Liberals publicly announced they would support MacDonald, causing the government to fall in January 1924.<ref>[[Maurice Cowling]], ''The Impact of Labour 1920\u20131924: The Beginning of Modern British Politics'' (Cambridge 1971) pp.&nbsp;332\u2013333, 384</ref>\n\n==Home Secretary==\n[[File:Wm Joynson-Hicks cigarette card.jpg|thumb|Cigarette card, 1926.]]\n\nThe Conservatives returned to power in November 1924 and Joynson-Hicks was appointed as [[Home Secretary]]. [[Francis Thompson (historian)|Francis Thompson]] described him as \"the most prudish, puritanical and protestant Home Secretary of the twentieth century\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/> Promotion appears to have gone to his head somewhat and he allowed himself to be touted as a prospective party leader, a possibility which [[Leo Amery]] dismissed as \"amazing\" (October 1925).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n===Public morals===\nJoynson-Hicks was portrayed as a reactionary for his attempts to crack down on [[night club]]s and other aspects of the \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\". He was also heavily implicated in the banning of [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s lesbian novel, ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928) in which he took a personal interest.<ref>[[Diana Souhami]], ''The Trials of Radclyffe Hall'' (London 1999) pp.&nbsp;180\u2013181: a more recent but unfortunately not widely available account of these actions may be found in Huw Clayton, \"A Frisky, Tiresome Colt?\" Sir William Joynson-Hicks, the Home Office and the \"Roaring Twenties\" in London, 1924\u20131929\" Aberystwyth University PhD thesis (2009)</ref>\n\nHe wanted to stem what he called \"the flood of filth coming across the Channel\". He clamped down on the work of [[D. H. Lawrence]] (he helped to force the publication of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' in an expurgated version), as well as on books on [[contraception|birth control]] and the translation of ''[[The Decameron]]''. He ordered the raiding of nightclubs, where a great deal of after-hours drinking took place, with many members of fashionable society being arrested. The nightclub owner [[Kate Meyrick]] was in and out of prison at least three times, her release parties being causes for big champagne celebrations. All of this was satirised in [[A. P. Herbert|A.P. Herbert]]\u2019s one act play ''The Two Gentlemen of Soho'' (1927).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n===General Strike and subversion===\nIn 1925, he ordered a show trial of [[Harry Pollitt]] and a dozen other leading communists, using the [[Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797]].<ref>The ODNB article for his Cabinet colleague [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Douglas Hogg]], Attorney-General at the time, by John Ramsden, states that Hogg was the real driving force behind this action. See [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Hogg's biography]] for details.</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\">Matthew 2004, p40</ref> During the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]], he was a leading organiser of the systems that maintained supplies and law and order, although there is some evidence that left to himself he would have pursued a more hawkish policy \u2013 most notably, his repeated appeals for more volunteer constables and his attempt to close down the ''[[Daily Herald (United Kingdom)|Daily Herald]]''.<ref>Anne Perkins, ''A Very British Strike: 3\u201312 May 1926'' (London 2006) pp. 160, 180, 138\u20139</ref>\n\nHaving been a hardliner during the General Strike he remained a staunch anti-communist thereafter, although the left appear to have warmed a little to him over the Prayer Book controversy. Against the wishes of Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain he ordered a police raid on the Soviet trade agency [[All Russian Co-operative Society|ARCOS]] in 1927, apparently actually hoping to rupture Anglo-Soviet relations. He was popular with the police and on his retirement a portrait of him was erected in [[Scotland Yard]], paid for by police subscription.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\">Matthew 2004, p40</ref>\n\n===Revised Prayer Book===\n[[File:Felixstowe StAndrew plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque at St Andrew's parish church, [[Felixstowe]], Suffolk, commemorating the defeat of the [[1928 Prayer Book]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]]]\nIn 1927 Joynson-Hicks turned his fire on the  [[Book of Common Prayer (1928)|proposed revision]] of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. The law required Parliament to approve such revisions, normally regarded as a formality.<ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\">[[Ross McKibbin]], ''Classes and Cultures: England 1918\u20131951'' (Oxford 1998) pp.&nbsp;277\u2013278</ref> Joynson-Hicks had been President of the evangelical National Church League since 1921, and he went against Baldwin\u2019s wishes in opposing the Revised Prayer Book.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nWhen the Prayer Book came before the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Joynson-Hicks argued strongly against its adoption as he felt it strayed far from the [[Protestant]] principles of the [[Church of England]]. He likened the Revised Prayer Book to \"papistry\", as he believed that the [[Reserved sacrament|reservation of sacrament]] implied a belief in [[transubstantiation]]. The debate on the Prayer Book is regarded as one of the most eloquent ever seen in the Commons, and resulted in the rejection of the revised Prayer Book in 1927.<ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\"/><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/> His allies were an alliance of ultra-Protestant Tories and nonconformist Liberals and Labour, and some of them likened him to [[John Hampden]] or [[Oliver Cromwell]]. It was said that no such occasion had been seen since the anti-Catholic agitation of [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851|1850-1]] or, some said, since the late seventeenth century crises over [[Exclusion Crisis|Exclusion]] or [[Titus Oates]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nA further revised version (the \"Deposited Book\") was submitted in 1928 but rejected again.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, pp39-40\">Matthew 2004, pp39-40</ref><ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\"/>\n\nMany leading Church of England figures came to feel that [[disestablishment]] would become necessary to guard the Church against this sort of political interference. Joynson-Hicks' booklet ''The Prayer Book Crisis'' correctly forecast that the bishops would back off from demanding disestablishment, for fear of losing their state-provided salaries and endowments.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, pp39-40\"/> However, the National Assembly of the Church of England then declared an emergency, and this was argued as a pretext for the use of the 1928 Prayer Book in many churches for decades afterwards, an act of questionable legality.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, pp39-40\"/><ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\"/>\n\n===Votes for young women===\nOff the cuff and without Cabinet discussion, in a debate on a private member's bill on 20 February 1925, Joynson-Hicks pledged equal voting rights for women (clarifying a pronouncement of Baldwin's in the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 General Election]]).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks' 1933 biographer wrote that the claim that Joynson-Hicks' parliamentary pledge to [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Lady Astor]] in 1925 had committed the party to giving votes to young women was an invention of Winston Churchill that has entered popular mythology but has no basis in fact.<ref name = \"Taylor pp282-285\">[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp.&nbsp;282\u2013285</ref> However, Francis Thompson (2004) wrote that the Baldwin Government would probably not have taken action without Joynson-Hicks' pledge.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks personally moved the Second Reading of the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]] and was also responsible for piloting it through Parliament. He made a strong speech in support of the Bill, which lowered the voting age for women from 30 to 21 (the same age as men at the time), and which was blamed in part for the Conservatives' unexpected electoral defeat the following year, which the right of the party attributed to newly enfranchised young women (referred to derogatorily as \"flappers\") voting for the opposition Labour party.<ref name = \"Taylor pp282-285\"/><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\n===Reforms===\nThroughout his tenure at the Home Office, Joynson-Hicks was involved in the reform of the penal system \u2013 in particular, the [[Borstal]]s and the introduction of a legal requirement for all courts to have a [[probation officer]]. He made a point of visiting all the prisons in the country, and was often dismayed by what he found there.<ref>[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp.&nbsp;186\u2013189</ref> He made a concerted effort to improve the conditions of the prisons under his jurisdiction, and earned a compliment from persistent offender and night-club owner Kate Meyrick, who noted in her memoirs that prisons had improved considerably thanks to his efforts.<ref>Kate Meyrick, ''Secrets of the 43'' (2nd ed., Dublin 1994) p. 80</ref>\n\nJoynson-Hicks sided with Churchill over the General Strike and India, but parted company with him on the topic of greyhound racing, which Joynson-Hicks believed served a useful social function in getting poor people out of the pubs. He also thought that Churchill's view that totalisers were permissible for horse-racing but not for greyhounds smacked of one law for the rich and another for the poor.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nHe became something of a hero to shop workers because of the Shops (Hours of Closing) Act 1928, which banned working after 8pm and required employers to grant a half day holiday each week. He also repealed a regulation to allow chocolates to be sold in the ''first'' interval of theatre performances as well as the second.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nIn August 1928, [[Lord Beaverbrook]] thought Joynson-Hicks the only possible successor to Baldwin. However, he was a figure of fun to many of the public and most of his colleagues thought the idea of him as Prime Minister, in FML Thompson's view, \"ridiculous\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/> He was praised in the popular press and ridiculed in the upmarket weeklies. He insisted that he did not favour full censorship, and in his 1929 pamphlet ''Do We Need A Censor?'' he recorded that he had ordered the police to stamp out indecency in Hyde Park so that it would be safe for \"a man to take his daughter for a walk\" there.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nAs the time for a new general election loomed, Baldwin contemplated reshuffling his Cabinet to move Churchill from the Exchequer to the India Office, and asking all ministers older than himself (Baldwin was born in 1867) to step down, with the exception of Sir Austen Chamberlain. Joynson-Hicks would have been one of those asked to retire from the Cabinet if the Conservatives had been re-elected.<ref>Jenkins 1987, p89</ref>\n\nThe Conservatives unexpectedly lost power at the general election in May [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]. A month after the election Joynson-Hicks was raised to the peerage as the '''Viscount Brentford''', of [[Newick]] in the [[Sussex|County of Sussex]] in the [[1929 Dissolution Honours|Dissolution Honours]] (necessitating a [[1929 Twickenham by-election|by-election]] at which the Conservatives narrowly held his old seat).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 33515 |date= 9 July 1926 |page=4539 |city= London }}</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nLord Brentford remained a senior figure in the Conservative Party, but due to his declining health he was not invited to join the [[UK National Government|National Government]] at its formation in August 1931. As late as October 1931 Lord Beaverbrook urged him to set up a Conservative Shadow Cabinet, as an alternative to the National Government. The National Government was reconstructed in November 1931, but again he was not offered a return to office.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n==Family==\nLord Brentford married Grace Lynn, only daughter of Richard Hampson Joynson, JP, of [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]] [[Cheshire]], on 12 June 1895 in [[St. Margaret's Church, Westminster]]. They had two sons and one daughter.<ref>Matthew 2004, pp38-40</ref>\n\nJoynson-Hicks died at Newick Park, Sussex, on 8 June 1932, aged 66.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/> His wealth at death was \u00a367,661 5s 7d (around \u00a34m at 2016 prices).<ref>[http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound]</ref><ref>Matthew 2004, pp37-40</ref>\n\nHis widow the Viscountess Brentford died in January 1952.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/> He was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard. His youngest son, the Hon. [[Lancelot Joynson-Hicks, 3rd Viscount Brentford|Lancelot]] (who succeeded in the viscountcy in 1958), was also a Conservative politician.\n\n==Reputation==\nJoynson-Hicks' Victorian top hat and frock coat made him seem an old-fashioned figure, but he came to be regarded with a certain affection by the public. Bridgeman wrote of him \"There is something of the comedian in him, which is not intentional but inevitably apparent, which makes it hard to take him as seriously as one might\". Churchill wrote of him \"The worst that can be said about him is that he runs the risk of being most humorous when he wishes to be most serious\". After his death Leo Amery wrote that \"he was a very likeable fellow\" whilst Stanley Baldwin observed \"he may have said many foolish things but he rarely did one\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nAlthough Joynson-Hicks was Home Secretary, a notoriously difficult office to hold, for some four and a half years, he is frequently overlooked by both historians and politicians. His length of tenure was exceeded in the twentieth century only by [[Chuter Ede]], [[R. A. Butler]] and [[Herbert Morrison]],<ref>List available in David Butler and Gareth Butler, ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000'' (revised eighth edition Basingstoke 2005) p. 56</ref> yet he was not included in a list of long-serving Home Secretaries presented to [[Jack Straw]] in 2001 on his departure from the Home Office.<ref>[[Matthew d'Ancona]], \"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3623930/Mr-Blair-is-now-at-best-a-politician-in-remission.html Mr Blair is now, at best, a politician in remission],\" ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' (Opinion Section) 26 March 2006: article on Telegraph website</ref> He is also virtually the only major politician of the 1920s not to have been accorded a recent biography.\n\nFor many years detailed discussion of Joynson-Hicks' life and career was hampered by the inaccessibility of his papers, which were kept by the Brentford family. This meant the discourse on his life was shaped by the official biography of 1933 by H. A. Taylor, and by material published by his contemporaries \u2013 much of it published by people who hated him. As a result, public discourse has been shaped by material that portrayed him in an unflattering light. Ronald Blythe's biographical chapter in ''The Age of Illusion'' is perhaps the apogee of this tendency. Huw Clayton, a former pupil of W. D. Rubinstein, commented that \"to refer to ''The Age of Illusion'' as Irvingesque would be to overstate the case, yet I managed to get even one of Blythe's admirers to admit that the chapter on Joynson-Hicks (where he somehow worked the word \"[[paederast]]\" into the debate) was an unfair caricature of the man\".<ref>[[#Blythe|Blythe]], p. 35</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s the current Viscount lent his grandfather's papers to an MPhil student at the [[University of Westminster]], Jonathon Hopkins,<ref>Cameron Hazlehurst et al. (eds) ''A Guide to the Papers of British Cabinet Ministers 1900\u20131964'' (London 1997) p. 185</ref> who prepared a catalogue of them and wrote a short biography of Joynson-Hicks as part of his thesis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://doctorhuw.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/william-joynson-hicks/ |title=William Joynson-Hicks \u00ab Doctor Huw |publisher=Doctorhuw.wordpress.com |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref> In 2007, a number of these papers were deposited with the East Sussex Record Office in Lewes (which transferred to [[The Keep, Brighton|The Keep]] in Brighton in 2013) where they are available to the public.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/accessions/2007/07returns/07ac179.htm National Register of Archives: Accessions to Repositories 2007: East Sussex Record Office]. nationalarchives.gov.uk</ref> Huw Clayton, whose PhD thesis concerned Joynson-Hicks' moral policies at the Home Office, has announced that he plans to write a new biography of Joynson-Hicks with the aid of these sources.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> An article on Joynson-Hicks, written by Clayton, has since appeared in the ''Journal of Historical Biography''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Huw Clayton|title=The Life and Career of William Joynson-Hicks 1865\u20131932: A Reassessment|url=https://www.ufv.ca/jhb/Volume_8/Volume_8_Clayton.pdf|journal=The Journal of Historical Biography|volume=8|pages=1\u201332|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Arms==\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image = Brentford Achievement.png\n|escutcheon = Gules on a fess wavy between three fleurs-de-lis Or a portcullis Sable all within a bordure of the second.\n|crest = A stag\u2019s head Proper gorged with a  collar Or thereon five roses Gules and charged in the neck with a fleur-de-lis Gold.\n|supporters = On either side a stag Proper gorged with a collar Or thereon five roses Gules and charged on the neck with a fleur-de-lis Gold.\n|motto = Cassis Tutissima Virtus <ref>{{cite book|title=Burke's Peerage |date=1939}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|ref=Blythe|author=Blythe, Ronald|title=The Age of Illusion: England in the Twenties and Thirties 1919\u20131940|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofillusioneng0000blyt|url-access=registration|place=London|year= 1963|chapter= Ch. 2 \"The Salutary Tale of Jix\"}}\n* {{cite book|last = Jenkins|first = Roy| authorlink = Roy Jenkins| year = 1987| title = Baldwin| location = Bloomsbury Press| publisher = HarperCollins| isbn = 978-0002175869|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book|last = Matthew (editor)|first = Colin| authorlink = Colin Matthew| year = 2004| title = Dictionary of National Biography|volume = 27| location = Oxford| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0198614111|ref = harv}}, essay on Joynson-Hicks written by FML Thompson\n*{{cite book|ref=Taylor|author=Taylor, H.

He best known as a long-serving and controversial [[Home Secretary]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s Second Government from 1924 to 1929. He gained a reputation for strict [[authoritarianism]], opposing Communism and clamping down on nightclubs and what he saw as indecent literature. He also played an important role in the fight against the introduction of the Church of England [[Book of Common Prayer (1928)|Revised Prayer Book]], and in lowering the voting age for women from 30 to 21.\n\n==Early life and career==\n===Background and early life===\nWilliam Hicks, as he was initially called, was born in Canonbury, London on 23 June 1865.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\">Matthew 2004, p38</ref> He was the eldest of four sons and two daughters of Henry Hicks, of Plaistow Hall, [[Kent]], and his wife Harriett, daughter of William Watts. Hicks was a prosperous merchant and senior evangelical Anglican layman<ref>{{cite book |title=The Protestant Face of Anglicanism |author=Paul Zahl |publisher=Wm. B.

Her father was also a Manchester evangelical Tory. They were married on 12 June 1895. In 1896 he added his wife's name \"Joynson\" to his surname.<ref>[[#Blythe|Blythe]], p. 23</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n===Early attempts to enter Parliament===\nHe joined the Conservative Party (at that time part of the Unionist coalition, which name it retained until 1925) and was selected as a Conservative Parliamentary candidate in 1898. He unsuccessfully contested seats in [[Manchester]] in the general elections of [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900]] and [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]], losing to [[Winston Churchill]]. On the latter occasion, he made [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] speeches. At the time, there was an influx of Russian Jews fleeing from [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]], which had caused [[Arthur Balfour]]'s government to pass the [[Aliens Act 1905]]).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n===Motoring expert===\nJoynson-Hicks was an early authority on transport law, particularly motoring law. In 1906 he published \"The Law of Heavy and Light Mechanical Traction on Highways\". He was beginning to acquire a reputation as an evangelical lawyer with a perhaps paradoxical interest in the latest technology: motor cars (of which he owned several), telephones and aircraft.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nIn 1907 he became Chairman of the Motor Union, and presided over the merger with [[The Automobile Association]] in 1911, serving as chairman of the merged body until 1922.<ref name = \"Taylor29-30\"/><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/> One of his first actions was to assert the legality of AA patrols warning motorists of police [[speed trap]]s.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nHe was also President of the Lancashire Commercial Motor Users\u2019 Association of the National [[Threshing machine|Threshing Machine]] Owners\u2019 Association, and of the National [[Traction engine|Traction Engine]] Association.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nHe was also Treasurer of the [[Zenana Bible and Medical Mission]] and a member of the finance committee of the [[YMCA]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n==1908 by-election==\nJoynson-Hicks was elected to Parliament in a [[by-election]] in 1908, when [[Winston Churchill]] was obliged to submit to re-election in [[Manchester North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester North West]] after his appointment as [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]], as the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1908]] required newly appointed [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] ministers to [[Ministerial by-election|re-contest their seats]]. Cabinet ministers were normally returned unopposed, but as Churchill had [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from the Conservatives to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, the Conservatives were disinclined to allow him an uncontested return.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\n[[Ronald Blythe]] in \"The Salutary Tale of Jix\" in ''The Age of Illusion'' (1963) called it \"the most brilliant, entertaining and hilarious electoral fight of the century\". Joynson-Hicks' nickname \"Jix\" dates from this by-election.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/> The election was notable for both the attacks of the [[Suffragette]] movement on Churchill, over his refusal to support legislation that would give women the vote, and [[Jew]]ish hostility to Joynson-Hicks over his support for the controversial [[Aliens Act 1905|Aliens Act]] which aimed to restrict Jewish immigration.<ref name = \"Addison1993\">[[Paul Addison]], ''Churchill on the Home Front 1900\u20131955'' (2nd ed., London 1993) p. 64</ref> Joynson-Hicks called Labour leader [[Keir Hardie]] \"a leprous traitor\" who wanted to sweep away the [[Ten Commandments]]. This prompted [[H G Wells]] to send an open letter to Labour sympathisers in Manchester,<ref>although an [[Social Democratic Federation|SDF]] candidate obtained a modest vote at the by-election, there was no official Labour Party candidate at this or any previous election for the seat; Labour supporters were therefore encouraged to vote Liberal in accordance with the [[Gladstone-MacDonald pact]]</ref> saying that Joynson-Hicks \"represents absolutely the worst element in British political life \u2026 an entirely undistinguished man \u2026 and an obscure and ineffectual nobody\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks defeated Churchill. This provoked a strong reaction across the country with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' running the front page headline \"Winston Churchill is OUT! OUT! OUT!\" (Churchill shortly returned to Parliament as MP for [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]]).<ref name = \"Addison1993\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks gained personal notoriety in the immediate aftermath of this election for an address to his Jewish hosts at a dinner given by the [[Maccabaeans|Maccabean Society]], during which he said \"he had beaten them all thoroughly and soundly and was no longer their servant.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=W.

He contested [[Sunderland (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland]] in the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|second general election in December that year]], but was again defeated. He was returned unopposed for [[Brentford (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentford]] at a [[1911 Brentford by-election|by-election in March 1911]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nOn 12 May 1915, he presented a petition to the Commons demanding the internment of enemy aliens of military age and the withdrawal from coastal areas of all enemy aliens.<ref>Meeting the Enemy by Richard van Emden</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], he formed a [[Pals battalion]] within the [[Middlesex Regiment]], the \"[[The Football Battalion|Football Battalion]].\" He acquired a reputation as a well-informed backbencher, an expert on aircraft and motors, badgering ministers about matters of aircraft design and production and methods of attacking [[Zeppelin]]s. In 1916 he published a pamphlet ''The Command of the Air'' in which he advocated indiscriminate bombing of civilians in German cities, including Berlin. However, he was not offered a government post.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\">Matthew 2004, p39</ref>\n\nIn [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], his old constituency having been abolished, he became MP for [[Twickenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Twickenham]], holding the seat until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1929.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/>\n\nFor his war work, he was created a [[Baronet]], of [[Holmbury]] in the [[Surrey|County of Surrey]], in 1919.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 31587 |date= 7 October 1919 |page=12418 |city= London }}</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n==The Lloyd George Coalition==\nIn 1919-20 he went on an extended visit to the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[India]], which changed his political fortunes. At the time, there was considerable unrest in India and a rapid growth in the Home Rule movement, something Joynson-Hicks opposed due to the great economic importance of the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]] to Britain. He at one time had commented \"I know it is frequently said at missionary meetings that we conquered India to raise the level of the Indians. That is cant. We hold it as the finest outlet for British goods in general, and for Lancashire cotton goods in particular.\"<ref>Quoted in [[#Blythe|Blythe]], pp.&nbsp;27\u201328</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nHe emerged as a strong supporter of General [[Reginald Dyer]] over the [[Amritsar Massacre]], and nearly forced the resignation of the [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Edwin Montagu]], over the motion of censure the government put down concerning Dyer's actions.<ref>Cesarani p. 123 (he wrongly credits this campaign with toppling Montagu, who in fact stayed in office until the Lloyd George coalition fell in 1922)</ref> This episode established his reputation as one of the \"die-hards\" on the [[right-wing]] of the party, and he emerged as a strong critic of the party's participation in a [[coalition]] government with the Liberal [[David Lloyd George]].\n\nAs part of this campaign, he led an abortive attempt to block [[Austen Chamberlain]]'s nomination as leader of the Unionist party on [[Bonar Law]]'s retirement, putting forward [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]] instead with the express aim of \"splitting the coalition\".<ref>[[Max Aitken]], ''Decline and Fall of Lloyd George: and great was the fall thereof'' (London 1963) p. 21</ref>\n\n==Entering government==\nJoynson-Hicks played a small role in the fall of Lloyd George Coalition, which he had so disliked, in October 1922. The refusal of many leading Conservatives, who had been supporters of the Coalition, to serve in [[Bonar Law]]'s new government opened up promotion prospects. Joynson-Hicks was appointed [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]] (a junior minister, effectively deputy to the [[President of the Board of Trade]]). In the fifteen-month Conservative administration of first [[Bonar Law]] and then [[Stanley Baldwin]], Joynson-Hicks was rapidly promoted. In March 1923, he became [[Paymaster-General]] then [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], filling positions left vacant by the promotion of [[Neville Chamberlain]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nWhen [[Stanley Baldwin]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in May 1923, he initially also retained his previous position of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] whilst searching for a permanent successor. To relieve the burden of this position, he promoted Joynson-Hicks to [[Secretary to the Treasury|Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] and included him in the Cabinet.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nIn that role, Joynson-Hicks was responsible for making the ''[[Hansard]]'' statement, on 19 July 1923, that the [[Inland Revenue]] would not prosecute a defaulting taxpayer who made a full confession and paid the outstanding tax, interest and penalties. Joynson-Hicks had hopes of eventually becoming Chancellor himself, but instead Neville Chamberlain was appointed to the post in August 1923. Once more, Joynson-Hicks filled the gap left by Chamberlain's promotion, serving as [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]]. He became a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] in 1923.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 32809 |date= 27 March 1923 |page=2303 |city= London }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[hung parliament]], amounting to a Unionist defeat in the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|general election of December 1923]], Joynson-Hicks became a key figure in various intra-party attempts to oust Baldwin. At one time, the possibility of his becoming leader himself was discussed, but it seems to have been quickly discarded. He was involved in a plot to persuade [[Arthur Balfour]] that should the King seek his advice on whom to appoint Prime Minister, Balfour would advise him to appoint Austen Chamberlain or [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] Prime Minister instead of Labour leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. The plot failed when Balfour refused to countenance such a move and the Liberals publicly announced they would support MacDonald, causing the government to fall in January 1924.<ref>[[Maurice Cowling]], ''The Impact of Labour 1920\u20131924: The Beginning of Modern British Politics'' (Cambridge 1971) pp.&nbsp;332\u2013333, 384</ref>\n\n==Home Secretary==\n[[File:Wm Joynson-Hicks cigarette card.jpg|thumb|Cigarette card, 1926.]]\n\nThe Conservatives returned to power in November 1924 and Joynson-Hicks was appointed as [[Home Secretary]]. [[Francis Thompson (historian)|Francis Thompson]] described him as \"the most prudish, puritanical and protestant Home Secretary of the twentieth century\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/> Promotion appears to have gone to his head somewhat and he allowed himself to be touted as a prospective party leader, a possibility which [[Leo Amery]] dismissed as \"amazing\" (October 1925).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n===Public morals===\nJoynson-Hicks was portrayed as a reactionary for his attempts to crack down on [[night club]]s and other aspects of the \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\". He was also heavily implicated in the banning of [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s lesbian novel, ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928) in which he took a personal interest.<ref>[[Diana Souhami]], ''The Trials of Radclyffe Hall'' (London 1999) pp.&nbsp;180\u2013181: a more recent but unfortunately not widely available account of these actions may be found in Huw Clayton, \"A Frisky, Tiresome Colt?\" Sir William Joynson-Hicks, the Home Office and the \"Roaring Twenties\" in London, 1924\u20131929\" Aberystwyth University PhD thesis (2009)</ref>\n\nHe wanted to stem what he called \"the flood of filth coming across the Channel\". He clamped down on the work of [[D. H. Lawrence]] (he helped to force the publication of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' in an expurgated version), as well as on books on [[contraception|birth control]] and the translation of ''[[The Decameron]]''. He ordered the raiding of nightclubs, where a great deal of after-hours drinking took place, with many members of fashionable society being arrested. The nightclub owner [[Kate Meyrick]] was in and out of prison at least three times, her release parties being causes for big champagne celebrations. All of this was satirised in [[A. P. Herbert|A.P. Herbert]]\u2019s one act play ''The Two Gentlemen of Soho'' (1927).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n===General Strike and subversion===\nIn 1925, he ordered a show trial of [[Harry Pollitt]] and a dozen other leading communists, using the [[Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797]].<ref>The ODNB article for his Cabinet colleague [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Douglas Hogg]], Attorney-General at the time, by John Ramsden, states that Hogg was the real driving force behind this action. See [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Hogg's biography]] for details.</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\">Matthew 2004, p40</ref> During the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]], he was a leading organiser of the systems that maintained supplies and law and order, although there is some evidence that left to himself he would have pursued a more hawkish policy \u2013 most notably, his repeated appeals for more volunteer constables and his attempt to close down the ''[[Daily Herald (United Kingdom)|Daily Herald]]''.<ref>Anne Perkins, ''A Very British Strike: 3\u201312 May 1926'' (London 2006) pp. 160, 180, 138\u20139</ref>\n\nHaving been a hardliner during the General Strike he remained a staunch anti-communist thereafter, although the left appear to have warmed a little to him over the Prayer Book controversy. Against the wishes of Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain he ordered a police raid on the Soviet trade agency [[All Russian Co-operative Society|ARCOS]] in 1927, apparently actually hoping to rupture Anglo-Soviet relations. He was popular with the police and on his retirement a portrait of him was erected in [[Scotland Yard]], paid for by police subscription.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\">Matthew 2004, p40</ref>\n\n===Revised Prayer Book===\n[[File:Felixstowe StAndrew plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque at St Andrew's parish church, [[Felixstowe]], Suffolk, commemorating the defeat of the [[1928 Prayer Book]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]]]\nIn 1927 Joynson-Hicks turned his fire on the  [[Book of Common Prayer (1928)|proposed revision]] of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. The law required Parliament to approve such revisions, normally regarded as a formality.<ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\">[[Ross McKibbin]], ''Classes and Cultures: England 1918\u20131951'' (Oxford 1998) pp.&nbsp;277\u2013278</ref> Joynson-Hicks had been President of the evangelical National Church League since 1921, and he went against Baldwin\u2019s wishes in opposing the Revised Prayer Book.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nWhen the Prayer Book came before the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Joynson-Hicks argued strongly against its adoption as he felt it strayed far from the [[Protestant]] principles of the [[Church of England]]. He likened the Revised Prayer Book to \"papistry\", as he believed that the [[Reserved sacrament|reservation of sacrament]] implied a belief in [[transubstantiation]]. The debate on the Prayer Book is regarded as one of the most eloquent ever seen in the Commons, and resulted in the rejection of the revised Prayer Book in 1927.<ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\"/><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/> His allies were an alliance of ultra-protestant Tories and nonconformist Liberals and Labour, and some of them likened him to [[John Hampden]] or [[Oliver Cromwell]]. It was said that no such occasion had been seen since the anti-Catholic agitation of [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851|1850-1]] or, some said, since the late seventeenth century crises over [[Exclusion Crisis|Exclusion]] or [[Titus Oates]].<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\nA further revised version (the \"Deposited Book\") was submitted in 1928 but rejected again.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, pp39-40\">Matthew 2004, pp39-40</ref><ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\"/>\n\nMany leading Church of England figures came to feel that [[disestablishment]] would become necessary to guard the Church against this sort of political interference. Joynson-Hicks' booklet ''The Prayer Book Crisis'' correctly forecast that the bishops would back off from demanding disestablishment, for fear of losing their state-provided salaries and endowments.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, pp39-40\"/> However, the National Assembly of the Church of England then declared an emergency, and this was argued as a pretext for the use of the 1928 Prayer Book in many churches for decades afterwards, an act of questionable legality.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, pp39-40\"/><ref name = \"McKibbin 1988, pp277-278\"/>\n\n===Votes for young women===\nOff the cuff and without Cabinet discussion, in a debate on a private member\u2019s bill on 20 February 1925, Joynson-Hicks pledged equal voting rights for women (clarifying a pronouncement of Baldwin\u2019s in the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 General Election]]).<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks' 1933 biographer wrote that the claim that Joynson-Hicks' parliamentary pledge to [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Lady Astor]] in 1925 had committed the party to giving votes to young women was an invention of Winston Churchill that has entered popular mythology but has no basis in fact.<ref name = \"Taylor pp282-285\">[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp.&nbsp;282\u2013285</ref> However, Francis Thompson (2004) wrote that the Baldwin Government would probably not have taken action without Joynson-Hicks' pledge.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nJoynson-Hicks personally moved the Second Reading of the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928]] and was also responsible for piloting it through Parliament. He made a strong speech in support of the Bill, which lowered the voting age for women from 30 to 21 (the same age as men at the time), and which was blamed in part for the Conservatives' unexpected electoral defeat the following year, which the right of the party attributed to newly enfranchised young women (referred to derogatorily as \"flappers\") voting for the opposition Labour party.<ref name = \"Taylor pp282-285\"/><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\n===Reforms===\nThroughout his tenure at the Home Office, Joynson-Hicks was involved in the reform of the penal system \u2013 in particular, the [[Borstal]]s and the introduction of a legal requirement for all courts to have a [[probation officer]]. He made a point of visiting all the prisons in the country, and was often dismayed by what he found there.<ref>[[#Taylor|Taylor]], pp.&nbsp;186\u2013189</ref> He made a concerted effort to improve the conditions of the prisons under his jurisdiction, and earned a compliment from persistent offender and night-club owner Kate Meyrick, who noted in her memoirs that prisons had improved considerably thanks to his efforts.<ref>Kate Meyrick, ''Secrets of the 43'' (2nd ed., Dublin 1994) p. 80</ref>\n\nJoynson-Hicks sided with Churchill over the General Strike and India, but parted company with him on the topic of greyhound racing, which Joynson-Hicks believed served a useful social function in getting poor people out of the pubs. He also thought that Churchill's view that totalisers were permissible for horse-racing but not for greyhounds smacked of one law for the rich and another for the poor.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nHe became something of a hero to shop workers because of the Shops (Hours of Closing) Act 1928, which banned working after 8pm and required employers to grant a half day holiday each week. He also repealed a regulation to allow chocolates to be sold in the ''first'' interval of theatre performances as well as the second.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nIn August 1928, [[Lord Beaverbrook]] thought Joynson-Hicks the only possible successor to Baldwin. However, he was a figure of fun to many of the public and most of his colleagues thought the idea of him as Prime Minister, in FML Thompson's view, \"ridiculous\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/> He was praised in the popular press and ridiculed in the upmarket weeklies. He insisted that he did not favour full censorship, and in his 1929 pamphlet ''Do We Need A Censor?'' he recorded that he had ordered the police to stamp out indecency in Hyde Park so that it would be safe for \"a man to take his daughter for a walk\" there.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nAs the time for a new general election loomed, Baldwin contemplated reshuffling his Cabinet to move Churchill from the Exchequer to the India Office, and asking all ministers older than himself (Baldwin was born in 1867) to step down, with the exception of Sir Austen Chamberlain. Joynson-Hicks would have been one of those asked to retire from the Cabinet if the Conservatives had been re-elected.<ref>Jenkins 1987, p89</ref>\n\nThe Conservatives unexpectedly lost power at the general election in May [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]. A month after the election Joynson-Hicks was raised to the peerage as the '''Viscount Brentford''', of [[Newick]] in the [[Sussex|County of Sussex]] in the [[1929 Dissolution Honours|Dissolution Honours]] (necessitating a [[1929 Twickenham by-election|by-election]] at which the Conservatives narrowly held his old seat).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 33515 |date= 9 July 1926 |page=4539 |city= London }}</ref><ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nLord Brentford remained a senior figure in the Conservative Party, but due to his declining health he was not invited to join the [[UK National Government|National Government]] at its formation in August 1931. As late as October 1931 Lord Beaverbrook urged him to set up a Conservative Shadow Cabinet, as an alternative to the National Government. The National Government was reconstructed in November 1931, but again he was not offered a return to office.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p39\"/>\n\n==Family==\nLord Brentford married Grace Lynn, only daughter of Richard Hampson Joynson, JP, of [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]] [[Cheshire]], on 12 June 1895 in [[St. Margaret's Church, Westminster]]. They had two sons and one daughter.<ref>Matthew 2004, pp38-40</ref>\n\nJoynson-Hicks died at Newick Park, Sussex, on 8 June 1932, aged 66.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/> His wealth at death was \u00a367,661 5s 7d (around \u00a34m at 2016 prices).<ref>[http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound]</ref><ref>Matthew 2004, pp37-40</ref>\n\nHis widow the Viscountess Brentford died in January 1952.<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p38\"/> He was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard. His youngest son, the Hon. [[Lancelot Joynson-Hicks, 3rd Viscount Brentford|Lancelot]] (who succeeded in the viscountcy in 1958), was also a Conservative politician.\n\n==Reputation==\nJoynson-Hicks' Victorian top hat and frock coat made him seem an old-fashioned figure, but he came to be regarded with a certain affection by the public. Bridgeman wrote of him \"There is something of the comedian in him, which is not intentional but inevitably apparent, which makes it hard to take him as seriously as one might\". Churchill wrote of him \"The worst that can be said about him is that he runs the risk of being most humorous when he wishes to be most serious\". After his death Leo Amery wrote that \"he was a very likeable fellow\" whilst Stanley Baldwin observed \"he may have said many foolish things but he rarely did one\".<ref name = \"Matthew 2004, p40\"/>\n\nAlthough Joynson-Hicks was Home Secretary, a notoriously difficult office to hold, for some four and a half years, he is frequently overlooked by both historians and politicians. His length of tenure was exceeded in the twentieth century only by [[Chuter Ede]], [[R. A. Butler]] and [[Herbert Morrison]],<ref>List available in David Butler and Gareth Butler, ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000'' (revised eighth edition Basingstoke 2005) p. 56</ref> yet he was not included in a list of long-serving Home Secretaries presented to [[Jack Straw]] in 2001 on his departure from the Home Office.<ref>[[Matthew d'Ancona]], \"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3623930/Mr-Blair-is-now-at-best-a-politician-in-remission.html Mr Blair is now, at best, a politician in remission],\" ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' (Opinion Section) 26 March 2006: article on Telegraph website</ref> He is also virtually the only major politician of the 1920s not to have been accorded a recent biography.\n\nFor many years detailed discussion of Joynson-Hicks' life and career was hampered by the inaccessibility of his papers, which were kept by the Brentford family. This meant the discourse on his life was shaped by the official biography of 1933 by H. A. Taylor, and by material published by his contemporaries \u2013 much of it published by people who hated him. As a result, public discourse has been shaped by material that portrayed him in an unflattering light. Ronald Blythe's biographical chapter in ''The Age of Illusion'' is perhaps the apogee of this tendency. Huw Clayton, a former pupil of W. D.

He participated in Jewish welfare societies and other associations. In 1911, he laid the foundation stone of a synagogue at [[Southend]].<ref>''The Times'', 11 August 1911 p2</ref> He also took a leading role in the financing and organisation of the Soup Kitchen for the Jewish Poor.<ref>''The Times'', 18 October 1913 p4</ref>\nIn 1919 he was a prominent member of the organisation dedicated to the creation of a Jewish [[War Memorial]] to take the form of a fund of one million pounds for the endowment of Jewish religious education and the possible erection of a college for Jewish learning at [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]].<ref>''The Times'', 10 June 1919 p21</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1882, Henry established the firm of C S Henry & Co. of London, metal merchants and copper importers<ref>Bentley Brinkerhoff Gilbert, ''David Lloyd George, a political life\u2013Volume I, The Architect of Change''; B T Batsford, 1987 p322</ref> of which he became managing director.<ref name=\"Commons p77\">''The Times House of Commons, 1910;'' Politico's Publishing, 2004 p77</ref> The undertaking was converted into a [[Limited Liability Company]] in 1902.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> The venture was clearly a great success as by 1915 he was being described as a millionaire,<ref name=\"P Taylor p74\">[[A J P Taylor]] (ed.), ''Lloyd George: A Diary by Frances Stevenson''; Hutchinson, 1971 p74</ref> and [[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]] a biographer of [[David Lloyd George]], wrote of Henry that he was a [[self-made man]] who had made a fortune in South Africa.<ref>[[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, his Life and Times''; Hutchinson, 1954 p134</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] he undertook a number of missions for the government accomplishing important work in the United States of America and [[Sweden]]. At his own expense he equipped a private home for wounded soldiers in [[Berkshire]] and promoted the welfare of British troops in other ways.<ref name=\"The Times, 29 December 1919 p5\"/> Henry also had interests in journalism. He was to become one of the proprietors of the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' and later founded the newspaper the ''[[Jewish Guardian]]''. Many prominent Jews opposed the establishment of a Jewish state, fearing this would lead to their co-religionists losing the citizenship of those countries where they and their forebears had long lived and prospered.<ref>Frank Owen, ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, his Life and Times''; Hutchinson, 1954 p427</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Chelmsford===\n\nAt the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1900]], Henry was selected to fight the [[Chelmsford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelmsford Division]] of [[Essex]] for the Liberal Party. At the time he was associated with the Liberal Imperialists,<ref>''The Times'', 29 September 1900 p10</ref> a centrist faction within the Liberal Party in the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] periods. The Liberal Imperialists were in favour of a more positive attitude towards the development of the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperialism]], ending the primacy of the party's commitment to [[Irish Home Rule]]. In domestic affairs they advocated the concept of 'national efficiency'.<ref>Iain Sharpe, Entry on Liberal Imperialists in ''Dictionary of Liberal Thought'', Politico's, 2007 pp. 214\u2013216.</ref> However Chelmsford was a safe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] seat, the previous member having been returned unopposed in [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895]] and Henry's opponent was elected with a majority of 3,129 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 9 October 1900 p8</ref>\n\n===Shropshire MP===\n\nBy 1905 it had become known that [[Sir Alexander Brown, 1st Baronet|Sir A H Brown]], the [[Liberal Unionist]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for the [[Wellington (Shropshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Wellington Division]] of [[Shropshire]] wished to stand down at the next election.<ref>''The Times'', 18 January 1905 p4</ref> Henry was selected to stand in the constituency at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].<ref>''The Times'', 5 December 1905 p9</ref> His opponent, [[Hildebrand Harmsworth]], had the benefit of the public support of Liberal Unionist leader, [[Joseph Chamberlain]],<ref>''The Times'', 26 January 1906 p3</ref> but Henry secured the support of David Lloyd George to speak in Wellington on his behalf.<ref>Frank Owen, ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, his Life and Times''; Hutchinson, 1954 p146</ref> Henry won the seat with a majority of 1,692 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 26 January 1906 p10</ref>\nHenry held his seat in a straight fight against the Unionists in [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]] with a slightly reduced majority of 1,189 votes;<ref name=\"Commons p77\"/> and again in [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910]] this time by a majority of 1,118.<ref>''The Times House of Commons, 1911;'' Politico's Publishing, 2004 p85</ref> The constituency was abolished for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and Henry switched his candidacy to the newly created seat of [[The Wrekin (historic UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]] when he was returned unopposed as a supporter of the [[Coalition government 1916-1922|Coalition government]].<ref>''The Times House of Commons, 1919;'' Politico's Publishing, 2004 p60</ref>\n\n===Henry and Lloyd George===\n\nBoth Henry's personal and political lives were intertwined with that of [[David Lloyd George]]. When Lloyd George formed his coalition government with the Conservatives in December 1916, Henry was one of those Liberals who stayed on the government side<ref>''The Times'', 13 December 1916 p11</ref> and he was generally identified as a strong supporter of the new prime minister.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party,1914\u20131935;'' Cornell University Press, 1966 pp86, 104 & 114</ref> But there was more than just political affinity between Henry and Lloyd George. Henry and his wife had been close to Lloyd George since at least the time of the death of his daughter Mair in 1907. Henry hosted a trip to Germany for Lloyd George in 1908<ref name=\"Christine Woodland p237\"/> to allow Lloyd George, then recently appointed as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], to study the invalidity insurance and contributory [[old age pensions]] which had been introduced there by [[Otto von Bismarck]] twenty-five years before.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Lloyd George|year=1975|publisher=Barrie & Jenkins Ltd|location=London|isbn=0214200493|page=206|chapter=The People's David, 1905-1910}}</ref> They also travelled together abroad socially to Nice and Monte Carlo<ref>Don Cregier, ''Bounder from Wales: Lloyd George\u2019s Career before the First World War;'' University of Missouri Press, 1976 p142</ref> and other European destinations.<ref>''The Times'', 25 February 1913 p9</ref><ref>''The Times'', 3 January 1914 p7</ref>\nThe American Lady Henry had pretensions to be one of London's great political hostesses and Lloyd George often attended her functions in London and at their home at [[Henley-on-Thames]], sometimes taking his son Richard with him.<ref name=\"Ffion Hague p229\">[[Ffion Hague]], ''The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George\u2019s Life; 1919;'' Harper Press, 2008 p229</ref> Lloyd George also attended Henry family occasions at Henry's London home at Carlton Gardens.<ref>''The Times'', 16 July 1914 p11</ref> It is not known for certain if Lloyd George and Julia Henry had an affair, although one of Lloyd George's biographers states that they did, adding that it was not serious on Lloyd George's part.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George War Leader 1916\u20131918;'' Penguin Books, 2002 p79</ref> However they certainly flirted together and corresponded privately with each other. [[Richard Lloyd George, 2nd Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor|Richard Lloyd George]] apparently thought his father could be in love with the \u201cdark, tall and very attractive Lady J.\u201d <ref>Richard Lloyd George, ''Lloyd George''; Frederick Muller Ltd, 1960 pp107-108</ref> and that they were having an affair.<ref name=\"Ffion Hague p229\"/> Even [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] was concerned that there had been a lot of gossip about Lady Julia and Lloyd George and this may have delayed her husband's getting his [[knighthood]].<ref>Cameron Hazlehurst and Christine Woodland (eds.), ''A Liberal Chronicle: Journals and Papers of J A Pease, 1908\u20131910''; Historians Press, 1994 p102</ref> [[Frances Stevenson]] certainly believed that Lloyd George had not only been close to Lady Henry but that Lady Henry herself was clearly in love with him, describing her as 'quite mad' about him.<ref name=\"P Taylor p74\"/> After Frances Stevenson started working for Lloyd George in 1911 and he began to become attracted to her, Lloyd George determined to stop any dalliance with Julia Henry. She was distressed by what she saw as a public snub and fled back to America, writing to her husband that she never wanted to be alone with Lloyd George again. It seems unlikely that Henry himself was aware of anything going on from Lloyd George's side. If anything he seems to have thought it was all in his wife's mind and believed she was exaggerating their relationship. It is also clear that Lady Henry's hurt feelings had a lot to do with the damage Lloyd George's rejection could do to her reputation as a political hostess.<ref>Ffion Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George\u2019s Life; 1919;'' Harper Press, 2008 p230-231</ref>\nSome reconciliation was affected in 1915 when Lloyd George visited the Henrys to show sympathy on the loss of their son in battle even though he was reluctant to do so because of the awkwardness arising from his previous relationship with Lady Henry and the strength of Julia Henry's feelings for him.<ref name=\"P Taylor p74\"/> Lloyd George also visited Henry when he was ill and dying in 1919, despite Lady Henry's making a scene and her trying to use his visits to her advantage with other members of the social set.<ref>Ffion Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George\u2019s Life; 1919;'' Harper Press, 2008 p232</ref> However the final breach with Lady Julia came the year after Henry's death in recriminations over Lloyd George's alleged misuse of \u00a320,000 donated by American friends of the Henrys for British war charities.<ref>Cameron Hazlehurst and Christine Woodland (eds.), ''A Liberal Chronicle: Journals and Papers of J A Pease, 1908\u20131910''; Historians Press, 1994 p238</ref>\n\n===Political orientation===\nHenry appears to have stayed on the right of the Liberal Party throughout his political career. He was a member of the Council of the [[British Empire League]].<ref>''The Times'', 28 November 1912 p8</ref> On one of the main policy questions of the day, he was opposed to the idea of [[Women's suffrage|votes for women]] being a member of the [[National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage]].<ref>''The Times'', 21 January 1913 p6</ref> When the Bill making women eligible for election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was going through the House of Commons in 1918, Henry moved an amendment to ensure they should not be able to stand for Parliament until they had reached the age of 30 years, the same age as voting eligibility.<ref>''The Times'', 6 November 1918 p8</ref> He also favoured [[conscription]], campaigning for it before its formal introduction during the war, being a signatory to the National Service Manifesto published in August 1915.<ref>''The Times'', 17 August 1915 p7</ref>\n\n==Honours and appointments==\nIn the New Years Honours list for 1911, Henry became a [[baronet]] with the creation of the [[Henry Baronets|Henry Baronetcy]], of Parkwood in the County of [[Berkshire]].<ref>''The Times'', 2 January 1911 p10</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28509 |date=30 June 1911|page=4833}}</ref> He also served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Berkshire.<ref>''The Times'', 11 April 1914 p5</ref>\nDuring the War, Henry was appointed to a number of important committees as he was identified as a loyal and sound occupant of the Coalition Liberal benches. He was a member of [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]]'s committee on After-War Trade, which was charged with looking at the possible introduction of the [[metric system]] to replace [[Coins of the pound sterling|Britain's existing coinage]], [[Avoirdupois|weights and measures]].<ref>''The Times'', 1 May 1917 p7</ref> He also sat on the [[Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy]], chaired by [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]].<ref>''The Times'', 26 May 1917 p7</ref> In July 1917, Henry was appointed to sit on the House of Commons [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] on Finance, chaired by [[Herbert Samuel]].<ref>''The Times'', 26 July 1917 p6</ref> In 1918, Henry was chosen by the [[Minister of Munitions]] to chair a committee of inquiry into the staffing and conditions at the headquarters of the Ministry of Munitions and to suggest economies or improvements.<ref>''The Times'', 24 April 1918 p3</ref> Henry was also sometime president of the British Section of the Inter-Allied Parliamentary Committee.<ref>''The Times'', 21 October 1918 p5</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHenry died, aged fifty-nine, at his London home, 5 Carlton Gardens, SW1, on 27 December 1919.

In 1911, he laid the foundation stone of a synagogue at [[Southend]].<ref>''The Times'', 11 August 1911 p2</ref> He also took a leading role in the financing and organisation of the Soup Kitchen for the Jewish Poor.<ref>''The Times'', 18 October 1913 p4</ref>\nIn 1919 he was a prominent member of the organisation dedicated to the creation of a Jewish [[War Memorial]] to take the form of a fund of one million pounds for the endowment of Jewish religious education and the possible erection of a college for Jewish learning at [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]].<ref>''The Times'', 10 June 1919 p21</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1882, Henry established the firm of C S Henry & Co. of London, metal merchants and copper importers<ref>Bentley Brinkerhoff Gilbert, ''David Lloyd George, a political life\u2013Volume I, The Architect of Change''; B T Batsford, 1987 p322</ref> of which he became managing director.<ref name=\"Commons p77\">''The Times House of Commons, 1910;'' Politico's Publishing, 2004 p77</ref> The undertaking was converted into a [[Limited Liability Company]] in 1902.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> The venture was clearly a great success as by 1915 he was being described as a millionaire,<ref name=\"P Taylor p74\">[[A J P Taylor]] (ed.), ''Lloyd George: A Diary by Frances Stevenson''; Hutchinson, 1971 p74</ref> and [[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]] a biographer of [[David Lloyd George]], wrote of Henry that he was a [[self-made man]] who had made a fortune in South Africa.<ref>[[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, his Life and Times''; Hutchinson, 1954 p134</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] he undertook a number of missions for the government accomplishing important work in the United States of America and [[Sweden]]. At his own expense he equipped a private home for wounded soldiers in [[Berkshire]] and promoted the welfare of British troops in other ways.<ref name=\"The Times, 29 December 1919 p5\"/> Henry also had interests in journalism. He was to become one of the proprietors of the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' and later founded the newspaper the ''[[Jewish Guardian]]''. Many prominent Jews opposed the establishment of a Jewish state, fearing this would lead to their co-religionists losing the citizenship of those countries where they and their forebears had long lived and prospered.<ref>Frank Owen, ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, his Life and Times''; Hutchinson, 1954 p427</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Chelmsford===\n\nAt the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1900]], Henry was selected to fight the [[Chelmsford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelmsford Division]] of [[Essex]] for the Liberal Party. At the time he was associated with the Liberal Imperialists,<ref>''The Times'', 29 September 1900 p10</ref> a centrist faction within the Liberal Party in the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] periods. The Liberal Imperialists were in favour of a more positive attitude towards the development of the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperialism]], ending the primacy of the party's commitment to [[Irish Home Rule]]. In domestic affairs they advocated the concept of 'national efficiency'.<ref>Iain Sharpe, Entry on Liberal Imperialists in ''Dictionary of Liberal Thought'', Politico's, 2007 pp. 214\u2013216.</ref> However Chelmsford was a safe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] seat, the previous member having been returned unopposed in [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895]] and Henry's opponent was elected with a majority of 3,129 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 9 October 1900 p8</ref>\n\n===Shropshire MP===\n\nBy 1905 it had become known that [[Sir Alexander Brown, 1st Baronet|Sir A H Brown]], the [[Liberal Unionist]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for the [[Wellington (Shropshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Wellington Division]] of [[Shropshire]] wished to stand down at the next election.<ref>''The Times'', 18 January 1905 p4</ref> Henry was selected to stand in the constituency at the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].<ref>''The Times'', 5 December 1905 p9</ref> His opponent, [[Hildebrand Harmsworth]], had the benefit of the public support of Liberal Unionist leader, [[Joseph Chamberlain]],<ref>''The Times'', 26 January 1906 p3</ref> but Henry secured the support of David Lloyd George to speak in Wellington on his behalf.<ref>Frank Owen, ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, his Life and Times''; Hutchinson, 1954 p146</ref> Henry won the seat with a majority of 1,692 votes.<ref>''The Times'', 26 January 1906 p10</ref>\nHenry held his seat in a straight fight against the Unionists in [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]] with a slightly reduced majority of 1,189 votes;<ref name=\"Commons p77\"/> and again in [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910]] this time by a majority of 1,118.<ref>''The Times House of Commons, 1911;'' Politico's Publishing, 2004 p85</ref> The constituency was abolished for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] and Henry switched his candidacy to the newly created seat of [[The Wrekin (historic UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]] when he was returned unopposed as a supporter of the [[Coalition government 1916-1922|Coalition government]].<ref>''The Times House of Commons, 1919;'' Politico's Publishing, 2004 p60</ref>\n\n===Henry and Lloyd George===\n\nBoth Henry's personal and political lives were intertwined with that of [[David Lloyd George]]. When Lloyd George formed his coalition government with the Conservatives in December 1916, Henry was one of those Liberals who stayed on the government side<ref>''The Times'', 13 December 1916 p11</ref> and he was generally identified as a strong supporter of the new prime minister.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party,1914\u20131935;'' Cornell University Press, 1966 pp86, 104 & 114</ref> But there was more than just political affinity between Henry and Lloyd George. Henry and his wife had been close to Lloyd George since at least the time of the death of his daughter Mair in 1907. Henry hosted a trip to Germany for Lloyd George in 1908<ref name=\"Christine Woodland p237\"/> to allow Lloyd George, then recently appointed as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], to study the invalidity insurance and contributory [[old age pensions]] which had been introduced there by [[Otto von Bismarck]] twenty-five years before.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Peter|title=Lloyd George|year=1975|publisher=Barrie & Jenkins Ltd|location=London|isbn=0214200493|page=206|chapter=The People's David, 1905-1910}}</ref> They also travelled together abroad socially to Nice and Monte Carlo<ref>Don Cregier, ''Bounder from Wales: Lloyd George\u2019s Career before the First World War;'' University of Missouri Press, 1976 p142</ref> and other European destinations.<ref>''The Times'', 25 February 1913 p9</ref><ref>''The Times'', 3 January 1914 p7</ref>\nThe American Lady Henry had pretensions to be one of London's great political hostesses and Lloyd George often attended her functions in London and at their home at [[Henley-on-Thames]], sometimes taking his son Richard with him.<ref name=\"Ffion Hague p229\">[[Ffion Hague]], ''The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George\u2019s Life; 1919;'' Harper Press, 2008 p229</ref> Lloyd George also attended Henry family occasions at Henry\u2019s London home at Carlton Gardens.<ref>''The Times'', 16 July 1914 p11</ref> It is not known for certain if Lloyd George and Julia Henry had an affair, although one of Lloyd George\u2019s biographers states that they did, adding that it was not serious on Lloyd George's part.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George War Leader 1916\u20131918;'' Penguin Books, 2002 p79</ref> However they certainly flirted together and corresponded privately with each other. [[Richard Lloyd George, 2nd Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor|Richard Lloyd George]] apparently thought his father could be in love with the \u201cdark, tall and very attractive Lady J.\u201d <ref>Richard Lloyd George, ''Lloyd George''; Frederick Muller Ltd, 1960 pp107-108</ref> and that they were having an affair.<ref name=\"Ffion Hague p229\"/> Even [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] was concerned that there had been a lot of gossip about Lady Julia and Lloyd George and this may have delayed her husband's getting his [[knighthood]].<ref>Cameron Hazlehurst and Christine Woodland (eds.), ''A Liberal Chronicle: Journals and Papers of J A Pease, 1908\u20131910''; Historians Press, 1994 p102</ref> [[Frances Stevenson]] certainly believed that Lloyd George had not only been close to Lady Henry but that Lady Henry herself was clearly in love with him, describing her as 'quite mad' about him.<ref name=\"P Taylor p74\"/> After Frances Stevenson started working for Lloyd George in 1911 and he began to become attracted to her, Lloyd George determined to stop any dalliance with Julia Henry. She was distressed by what she saw as a public snub and fled back to America, writing to her husband that she never wanted to be alone with Lloyd George again. It seems unlikely that Henry himself was aware of anything going on from Lloyd George's side. If anything he seems to have thought it was all in his wife's mind and believed she was exaggerating their relationship. It is also clear that Lady Henry's hurt feelings had a lot to do with the damage Lloyd George's rejection could do to her reputation as a political hostess.<ref>Ffion Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George\u2019s Life; 1919;'' Harper Press, 2008 p230-231</ref>\nSome reconciliation was affected in 1915 when Lloyd George visited the Henrys to show sympathy on the loss of their son in battle even though he was reluctant to do so because of the awkwardness arising from his previous relationship with Lady Henry and the strength of Julia Henry\u2019s feelings for him.<ref name=\"P Taylor p74\"/> Lloyd George also visited Henry when he was ill and dying in 1919, despite Lady Henry\u2019s making a scene and her trying to use his visits to her advantage with other members of the social set.<ref>Ffion Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George\u2019s Life; 1919;'' Harper Press, 2008 p232</ref> However the final breach with Lady Julia came the year after Henry\u2019s death in recriminations over Lloyd George\u2019s alleged misuse of \u00a320,000 donated by American friends of the Henrys for British war charities.<ref>Cameron Hazlehurst and Christine Woodland (eds.), ''A Liberal Chronicle: Journals and Papers of J A Pease, 1908\u20131910''; Historians Press, 1994 p238</ref>\n\n===Political orientation===\nHenry appears to have stayed on the right of the Liberal Party throughout his political career. He was a member of the Council of the [[British Empire League]].<ref>''The Times'', 28 November 1912 p8</ref> On one of the main policy questions of the day, he was opposed to the idea of [[Women's suffrage|votes for women]] being a member of the [[National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage]].<ref>''The Times'', 21 January 1913 p6</ref> When the Bill making women eligible for election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was going through the House of Commons in 1918, Henry moved an amendment to ensure they should not be able to stand for Parliament until they had reached the age of 30 years, the same age as voting eligibility.<ref>''The Times'', 6 November 1918 p8</ref> He also favoured [[conscription]], campaigning for it before its formal introduction during the war, being a signatory to the National Service Manifesto published in August 1915.<ref>''The Times'', 17 August 1915 p7</ref>\n\n==Honours and appointments==\nIn the New Years Honours list for 1911, Henry became a [[baronet]] with the creation of the [[Henry Baronets|Henry Baronetcy]], of Parkwood in the County of [[Berkshire]].<ref>''The Times'', 2 January 1911 p10</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28509 |date=30 June 1911|page=4833}}</ref> He also served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Berkshire.<ref>''The Times'', 11 April 1914 p5</ref>\nDuring the War, Henry was appointed to a number of important committees as he was identified as a loyal and sound occupant of the Coalition Liberal benches. He was a member of [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]]'s committee on After-War Trade, which was charged with looking at the possible introduction of the [[metric system]] to replace [[Coins of the pound sterling|Britain's existing coinage]], [[Avoirdupois|weights and measures]].<ref>''The Times'', 1 May 1917 p7</ref> He also sat on the [[Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy]], chaired by [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]].<ref>''The Times'', 26 May 1917 p7</ref> In July 1917, Henry was appointed to sit on the House of Commons [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] on Finance, chaired by [[Herbert Samuel]].<ref>''The Times'', 26 July 1917 p6</ref> In 1918, Henry was chosen by the [[Minister of Munitions]] to chair a committee of inquiry into the staffing and conditions at the headquarters of the Ministry of Munitions and to suggest economies or improvements.<ref>''The Times'', 24 April 1918 p3</ref> Henry was also sometime president of the British Section of the Inter-Allied Parliamentary Committee.<ref>''The Times'', 21 October 1918 p5</ref>\n\n==Death==\nHenry died, aged fifty-nine, at his London home, 5 Carlton Gardens, SW1, on 27 December 1919. He had been ill for several months.<ref name=\"The Times, 29 December 1919 p5\"/> His son having predeceased him, he had no heir and the Parkwood baronetcy became extinct.
