Pandavas agree to the plan that Draupadi will always be the chief consort of all brothers and always the empress. She will be in personal union with one brother every year and may bear him a child. Anyone of the other 4, who interrupts them during a private time within that one year, must go on a 11-month prilgrimage.<ref name=\"Panchali\"/> She mothers five sons from each of the Pandavas, regaining her virginity after every year.<ref name=Draupadi/> \n\nA well-known incident surrounding her is that of Duryodhana who falls down in a pool of water accidentally during Rajasuya Yajna, and is laughed at by Bhima, Arjuna, Madra twins and servants. In modern adaptations, this insult is attributed to Draupadi alone, but the scene in Vyasa Mahabharata is different.<ref>https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02046.htm</ref>\nWhen the eldest Pandava [[Yudhishthira]] loses her to Kauravas in a game of dice, [[Dushasana]] tries to disrobe her in the royal court.

While in exile in the forest, her second husband [[Bhima]] rescued her from various demons and [[Jayadratha]], who abducted her.<ref name=\"Panchali\"/> She also instructed Krishna's queen [[Satyabhama]] on the duties of a wife. In the 13th year of exile, Draupadi and her husbands spent life incognito in [[Virata]]'s court.

Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and separated from a mother. Though all of kanyas are described as mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element is the theme of loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society.  A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.\n\nThe Mahari dance tradition equates the panchakanya with the [[mahabhuta|five elements]]. Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari represent water, fire, earth, wind and ether respectively. In similar analogy, writer [[Vimla Patil]] associates Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari with wind, fire, earth, ether and water respectively.\n\n==Assessment & Remembrance==\n\n[[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote a collection of poems titled ''Pancha Kanya'' with themes of episodes from mythology of panchakanya.<ref name=\"George1992\">{{cite book|author=K.

Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and separated from a mother. Though all of kanyas are described as mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element is the theme of loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society.  A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.\n\nThe Mahari dance tradition equates the panchakanya with the [[mahabhuta|five elements]]. Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari represent water, fire, earth, wind and ether respectively. In similar analogy, writer [[Vimla Patil]] associates Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari with wind, fire, earth, ether and water respectively.\n\n==Assessment & Remembrance==\n\n[[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote a collection of poems titled ''Pancha Kanya'' with themes of episodes from mythology of panchakanya.<ref name=\"George1992\">{{cite book|author=K.

(later rebranded '''SGI''', historically known as '''Silicon Graphics Computer Systems''' or '''SGCS''') was an American [[high-performance computing]] manufacturer, producing [[computer hardware]] and [[software]]. Founded in [[Mountain View, California]] in November 1981 by [[James H. Clark|Jim Clark]], its initial market was [[3D graphics]] [[computer workstation]]s, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.\n\nEarly systems were based on the [[Geometry Engine]] that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at [[Stanford University]], and were derived from Clark's broader background in [[computer graphics]]. The Geometry Engine was the first [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) implementation of a ''[[geometry pipeline]]'', specialized hardware that accelerated the \"inner-loop\" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market.\n\nSilicon Graphics reincorporated as a [[Delaware corporation]] in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity [[Wintel]] machines began to erode SGI's stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to other platforms is a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] platforms to the [[Intel Itanium]], as well as introducing their own [[Linux]]-based [[Intel IA-32]] based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a [[supercomputer]] vendor, a move that also failed.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, SGI filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems, a deal finalized on May 11, 2009, with Rackable assuming the name [[Silicon Graphics International]]. The remains of Silicon Graphics, Inc. became Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Silicon Graphics logo.png|thumb|Silicon Graphics logo with distinctive 3-D box \"bug\"]]\n[[File:SGI LOGO.jpg|thumb]]\n{{Expand section|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[James H.

The porting of [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] further eroded the low end of SGI's product line.\n\nIn response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price [[Ed McCracken]] was fired and SGI brought in [[Richard Belluzzo]] to replace him. Under Belluzzo's leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = Microsoft man's shadow over bankrupt SGI\n  |author= Andrew Orlowski\n  |author-link = Andrew Orlowski\n  |date  = May 9, 2006\n  |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/09/sgi_chapter11_analysis/\n  |work=[[The Register]]\n  |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne such initiative was trying to sell workstations running Windows NT called [[SGI Visual Workstation|Visual Workstations]] in addition to workstations running [[IRIX]], the company's version of UNIX. This put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of Dell, making it more difficult to justify a price premium. The product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later.\n\nSGI's premature announcement of its migration from MIPS to Itanium and its abortive ventures into IA-32 architecture systems (the [[SGI Visual Workstation|Visual Workstation]] line, the ex-Intergraph Zx10 range and the SGI 1000-series Linux servers) damaged SGI's credibility in the market.\n\nIn 1999, in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company, Silicon Graphics Inc. changed its corporate identity to \"SGI\", although its legal name was unchanged.\n\nAt the same time, SGI announced a new logo consisting of only the letters \"sgi\" in a proprietary font called \"SGI\", created by branding and design consulting firm [[Landor Associates]], in collaboration with designer Joe Stitzlein. SGI continued to use the \"Silicon Graphics\" name for its workstation product line, and later re-adopted the cube logo for some workstation models.\n\nIn November 2005, SGI announced that it had been delisted from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange. SGI's [[market capitalization]] dwindled from a peak of over seven [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] dollars in 1995 to just $120 million at the time of delisting. In February 2006, SGI noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title = SGI's Future Could Include Bankruptcy, Sale|url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1925129,00.asp|work = ExtremeTech|date = February 10, 2006|accessdate = November 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Re-emergence===\nIn mid-2005, SGI hired Alix Partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit. SGI announced it was postponing its scheduled annual December stockholders meeting until March 2006. It proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn January 2006, SGI hired Dennis McKenna as its new CEO and chairman of the board of directors. Mr. McKenna succeeded [[Robert Bishop (manager)|Robert Bishop]], who remained vice chairman of the board of directors.\n\nOn May 8, 2006, SGI announced that it had filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection for itself and U.S. subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by $250 million.<ref>Patrick Fitzgerald.

The later IRIS 2000 and 3000 models developed into full [[UNIX]] [[workstation]]s.\n\n====IRIS 1000 series====\nThe first entries in the 1000 series (models 1000 and 1200, introduced in 1984) were graphics terminals, peripherals to be connected to a general-purpose computer such as a [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX]], to provide graphical [[raster graphics|raster display]] abilities. They used 8&nbsp;MHz Motorola 68000 CPUs with {{nowrap|768 kB}} of RAM and had no [[disk drive]]s. They booted over the network (via an [[Excelan]] EXOS/101 Ethernet card) from their controlling computer. They used the \"PM1\" CPU board, which was a variant of the board that was used in [[Stanford University]]'s [[SUN workstation]] and later in the [[Sun-1]] workstation from [[Sun Microsystems]]. The graphics system was composed of the GF1 [[frame buffer]], the UC3 \"Update Controller\", DC3 \"Display Controller\", and the BP2 bitplane. The 1000-series machines were designed around the [[Multibus]] standard.\n\nLater 1000-series machines, the 1400 and 1500, ran at 10&nbsp;MHz and had 1.5 MB of RAM. The 1400 had a 73 MB [[ST-506]] disk drive, while the 1500 had a 474 MB SMD-based disk drive with a [[Xylogics]] 450 disk controller. They may have used the PM2 CPU and PM2M1 RAM board from the 2000 series. The usual monitor for the 1000 series ran at 30&nbsp;Hz [[interlaced]]. Six beta-test units of the 1400 workstation were produced, and the first production unit (SGI's first commercial computer) was shipped to Carnegie-Mellon University's Electronic Imaging Laboratory in 1984.\n\n====IRIS 2000 and 3000 series====\n[[File:SGI-geometry-engine-chip.jpg|thumb|Geometry Engine chip from an IRIS 3120]]\n\nSGI rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line \u2014 the IRIS 2000 series, first released in August 1985.<ref>{{cite web| title = Iris 2000 Systems| publisher = SGIstuff.net| author = Gerhard Lenerz| url = http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/systems/iris2000.html| accessdate = January 4, 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120218035434/http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/systems/iris2000.html| archive-date = February 18, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> SGI began using the [[UNIX System V]] [[operating system]]. There were five models in two product ranges, the 2000/2200/2300/2400/2500 range which used [[Motorola 68010|68010 CPUs]] (the PM2 CPU module), and the later \"Turbo\" systems, the 2300T, 2400T and 2500T, which had [[Motorola 68020|68020s]] (the IP2 CPU module). All used the Excelan EXOS/201 Ethernet card, the same graphics hardware (GF2 Frame Buffer, UC4 Update Controller, DC4 Display Controller, BP3 Bitplane). Their main differences were the CPU, RAM, and [[Weitek]] [[Math coprocessor|Floating Point Accelerator]] boards, disk controllers and disk drives (both [[ST-506]] and [[Storage Module Device|SMD]] were available). These could be upgraded, for example from a 2400 to a 2400T. The 2500 and 2500T had a larger chassis, a standard 6' 19\" EIA rack with space at the bottom for two SMD disk drives weighing approximately {{nowrap|68 kg}} each.<ref>http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/sgi/iris/IRIS_FAQ.txt</ref> The non-Turbo models used the [[Multibus]] for the CPU to communicate with the floating point accelerator, while the Turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this. 60&nbsp;Hz monitors were used for the 2000 series.\n\nThe height of the machines using Motorola CPUs was reached with the IRIS 3000 series (models 3010/3020/3030 and 3110/3115/3120/3130, the 30s both being full-size rack machines). They used the same graphics subsystem and Ethernet as the 2000s, but could also use up to 12 \"geometry engines\", the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators. The standard monitor was a 19\" 60&nbsp;Hz non-interlaced unit with a tilt/swivel base; 19\" 30&nbsp;Hz interlaced and a 15\" 60&nbsp;Hz non-interlaced (with tilt/swivel base) were also available.\n\nThe IRIS 3130 and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time, being complete [[UNIX]] workstations. The 3130 was powerful enough to support a complete 3D animation and rendering package without mainframe support. With large capacity hard drives by standards of the day (two 300 MB drives), streaming tape and Ethernet, it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation.\n\nThe line was formally discontinued in November 1989, with about 3500 systems shipped of all 2000 and 3000 models combined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silicon Graphics IRIS 2000/3000 FAQ|author=Jonathan Levine|url=http://www.sgistuff.net/mirrors/irisfaq/index.php |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===RISC era===\nWith the introduction of the IRIS 4D series, SGI switched to [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] microprocessors. These machines were more powerful and came with powerful on-board floating-point capability. As 3D graphics became more popular in television and film during this time, these systems were responsible for establishing much of SGI's reputation.\n\nSGI produced a broad range of MIPS-based workstations and servers during the 1990s, running SGI's version of UNIX System V, now called [[IRIX]]. These included the massive Onyx visualization systems, the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to 64 processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution, fully realized 3D graphics.\n\nIn October 1991, MIPS announced the first commercially available [[64-bit]] microprocessor, the [[R4000]]. SGI used the R4000 in its [[SGI Crimson|Crimson]] workstation. IRIX 6.2 was the first fully 64-bit IRIX release, including 64-bit pointers.\n\nTo secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors (the 64-bit [[R4000]]), SGI acquired the company in 1992<ref>PC Magazine. \"[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=SGI&i=51221,00.asp SGI].\" Retrieved September 19, 2011.</ref> for $333 million<ref name=CHM>Computer History Museum. \"[http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/story/219 Silicon Graphics Professional IRIS 4D/50GT].\" Retrieved September 19, 2011.</ref><ref>Cate Corcoran (March 16, 1992), MIPS, Silicon merger could kill ACE/ARC, ''InfoWorld'', pp. 1 and 107.

The deal was signed in early 1993, and it was later made public in August of that year.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Outsiders|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|pages=61\u201362}}</ref> The console itself was later released in 1996. The RCP was developed by SGI's Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer [[Wei Yen|Dr. Wei Yen]].

Development of new MIPS microprocessors stopped, and the existing [[R12000]] design was extended multiple times until 2003 to provide existing customers more time to migrate to Itanium.\n\nIn August 2006, SGI announced the end of production for MIPS/IRIX systems,<ref>\n[http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html End of General Availability for MIPS IRIX Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307153053/http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html |date=March 7, 2008 }} at sgi.com</ref> and by the end of the year MIPS/IRIX products were no longer generally available from SGI.\n\n===IRIS GL and OpenGL===\nUntil the second generation Onyx [[RealityEngine|Reality Engine]] machines, SGI offered access to its high performance 3D graphics subsystems through a proprietary [[Application programming interface|API]] known as ''IRIS Graphics Language'' ([[IRIS GL]]). As more features were added over the years, IRIS GL became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use. In 1992, SGI decided to clean up and reform IRIS GL and made the bold move of allowing the resulting [[OpenGL]] API to be cheaply licensed by SGI's competitors, and set up an industry-wide consortium to maintain the OpenGL standard (the OpenGL Architecture Review Board).\n\nThis meant that for the first time, fast, efficient, cross-platform graphics programs could be written. To this day, OpenGL remains the only real-time 3D graphics standard to be portable across a variety of operating systems. OpenGL-ES even runs on many types of cell phones. Its main competitor ([[Direct3D]] from Microsoft) runs only on [[Microsoft Windows]]-based machines and some consoles.\n\n===ACE Consortium===\n{{main|Advanced Computing Environment}}\n\nSGI was part of the Advanced Computing Environment initiative, formed in the early 1990s with 20 other companies, including [[Compaq]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[MIPS Computer Systems]], [[Groupe Bull]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[NEC Corporation|NEC]], [[NeTpower]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Santa Cruz Operation]]. Its intent was to introduce workstations based on the [[MIPS architecture]] and able to run [[Windows NT]] and [[SCO UNIX]]. The group produced the [[Advanced RISC Computing]] (ARC) specification, but began to unravel little more than a year after its formation.\n\n===Entertainment industry===\nFor eight consecutive years (1995\u20132002), all films nominated for an Academy Award for Distinguished Achievement in Visual Effects were created on Silicon Graphics computer systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/news/video_sgi_sweeps_academy|title=News, Features, Reviews, Forums and Resources for the Professional Content Creator - Creative Planet Network|website=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}</ref> the technology was also used in commercials for [[Energizer Holdings|Energizer]], [[Benson & Hedges]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Pepsi]], [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[McDonald's]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Canada Dry]], [[Post Consumer Brands|Honey Comb]], [[Gatorade]], [[The Hershey Company|Reese's]], [[Pillsbury Doughboy]], \"Bud Bowl\", \"Scrubbing Bubbles\", [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[Dodge]], [[United Airlines]], and [[DHL Express|DHL]].\n\nAn [[SGI Crimson]] system with the [[fsn (file manager)|fsn]]<ref>[http://www.siliconbunny.com/fsn-the-irix-3d-file-system-tool-from-jurassic-park/ FSN \u2014 File System Navigator] at siliconbunny.com</ref> [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] file system navigator appeared in the 1993 movie ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgistuff.net/funstuff/hollywood/jpark.html|title=sgistuff.net|author=Gerhard Lenerz|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the movie ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', protagonists can be seen using an SGI laptop computer; however, the unit shown was not an actual working computer, but rather a fake laptop shell built around an SGI Corona LCD flat screen display.<ref>[http://www.bftr.com/Pages/projects/twister.html Banned From the Ranch Entertainment&nbsp;\u2014 Twister] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820193238/http://www.bftr.com/Pages/projects/twister.html |date=August 20, 2008 }} at bftr.com.</ref>\n\nThe 1995 film ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]'' also features an SGI laptop computer being used by Dr. Ross ([[Laura Linney]]) to communicate via satellite to TraviCom HQ.<ref>[http://www.siliconbunny.com/silicon-graphics-laptops/ SGI Laptops] at siliconbunny.com</ref>\n\nThe purple, lowercased \"'''sgi'''\" logo can be seen at the beginning of the opening credits of the [[HBO]] series [[Silicon Valley (TV series)|''Silicon Valley'']], before being taken down and replaced by the [[Google]] logo as the intro graphics progress. Google leased the former SGI buildings in 2003 for their headquarters in Mountain View, CA until they purchased the buildings outright in 2006.\n\nOnce inexpensive PCs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were SGI's core business, SGI shifted its focus to high performance servers for [[digital video]] and the Web. Many SGI graphics engineers left to work at other computer graphics companies such as [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] and [[Nvidia]], contributing to the PC 3D graphics revolution.\n\n===Free software===\nSGI was a promoter of [[free software]],{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} supporting several projects such as [[Linux (kernel)|Linux]] and [[Samba software|Samba]], and opening some of its own previously proprietary code such as the [[XFS]] filesystem and the [[Open64]] compiler.\n\nSGI was also important in its contribution to the C++ [[Standard Template Library]] (STL) with many useful extensions in the [[MIT License|MIT-like licensed]] SGI STL implementation. The extension keeps being carried by the direct descendant [[STLport]] and GNU's libstdc++.<ref>{{cite web |title=SGI Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide |url=https://www.boost.org/sgi/stl/index.html |accessdate=9 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Acquisition of Alias, Wavefront, Cray and Intergraph===\nIn 1995, SGI purchased Alias Research, [[Kroyer Films]], and [[Wavefront Technologies]] in a deal totaling approximately $500 million and merged the companies into Alias|Wavefront. In June 2004 SGI sold the business, later renamed to [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias/Wavefront]], to the private equity investment firm [[Accel-KKR]] for $57.1 million. In October 2005, [[Autodesk]] announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alias for $182 million in cash.\n\nIn February 1996, SGI purchased the well-known [[supercomputer]] manufacturer [[Cray Research]] for $740 million,<ref>David Einstein, [https://www.forbes.com/2000/03/03/mu4.html Could SGI Be A Takeover Target?] Forbes, March 2000.\n</ref> and began to use marketing names such as \"CrayLink\" for (SGI-developed) technology integrated into the SGI server line. Three months later, it sold the [[Cray Business Systems Division]], responsible for the [[CS6400]] SPARC/Solaris server, to [[Sun Microsystems]] for an undisclosed amount (acknowledged later by a Sun executive to be \"significantly less than $100 million\").<ref>{{cite press release\n  |title= Sun Microsystems announces intent to purchase Cray Business Systems Division\n  |publisher= Sun Microsystems\n  |date= May 17, 1996\n  |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sun+Microsystems+Announces+Intent+to+Purchase+Cray+Business+Systems...-a018293601\n  |accessdate= March 20, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | author1 = Lisa DiCarlo \n | title = Sun's Purchase Of Cray's Unix Server Business\n | url = https://www.forbes.com/2002/05/06/0506sun.html#67fc068a6a5e\n | work = [[Forbes]]\n | date = 2002-05-06\n | accessdate = 2019-01-24\n | quote = \n}}</ref> Many of the [[Cray T3E]] engineers designed and developed the [[SGI Altix]] and [[NUMAlink]] technology.

Sharon | last=Baker | title=Cray is making a name for itself in the world of supercomputers | date=November 17, 2002}}</ref> SGI also distributed its remaining interest in MIPS Technologies through a spin-off effective June 20, 2000.\n\nIn September 2000, SGI acquired the Zx10 series of Windows workstations and servers from [[Intergraph|Intergraph Computer Systems]] (for a rumored $100 million), and rebadged them as SGI systems. The product line was discontinued in June 2001.\n\n===SGI Visual Workstations===\nAnother attempt by SGI in the late 1990s to introduce its own family of Intel-based workstations running [[Windows NT]] or [[Red Hat Linux]] (see also [[SGI Visual Workstation]]) proved to be a financial disaster, and shook customer confidence in SGI's commitment to its own MIPS-based line.\n\n===Switch to Itanium===\nIn 1998, SGI announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own MIPS processors, but the upcoming \"super-chip\" from [[Intel]], code-named \"Merced\" and later called [[Itanium]]. Funding for its own high-end processors was reduced, and it was planned that the [[R10000]] would be the last MIPS mainstream processor. [[MIPS Technologies]] would focus entirely on the embedded market, where it was having some success, and SGI would no longer have to fund development of a CPU that, since the failure of [[Advanced RISC Computing|ARC]], found use only in their own machines. This plan quickly went awry. As early as 1999 it was clear the Itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected. As the production delays increased, MIPS' existing R10000-based machines grew increasingly uncompetitive. Eventually it was forced to introduce faster MIPS processors, the [[R10000#R12000|R12000]], [[R10000#R14000|R14000]] and [[R10000#R16000|R16000]], which were used in a series of models from 2002 through 2006.\n\nSGI's first Itanium-based system was the short-lived SGI 750 workstation, launched in 2001. SGI's MIPS-based systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the [[Itanium 2]]-based [[SGI Altix|Altix]] servers and [[SGI Prism|Prism]] workstations some time later. Unlike the MIPS systems, which ran [[IRIX]], the Itanium systems used [[SuSE Linux|SuSE Linux Enterprise Server]] with SGI enhancements as their [[operating system]]. SGI used [[Transitive Corporation]]'s [[QuickTransit]] software to allow their old MIPS/IRIX applications to run (in emulation) on the new Itanium/Linux platform.\n\nIn the server market the Itanium 2-based Altix eventually replaced the MIPS-based Origin product line. In the workstation market, the switch to Itanium was not completed before SGI exited the market.\n\nThe Altix was the most powerful computer in the world in 2006, assuming that a \"computer\" is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system. The Altix had 512 Itanium processors running under a single instance of [[Linux]]. A cluster of 20 machines was then the eighth-fastest [[supercomputer]]. All faster supercomputers were clusters, but none have as many [[FLOPS]] per machine. However, more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable. SGI acknowledged this and in 2007 moved away from the \"massive [[Non-Uniform Memory Access|NUMA]]\" model to clusters.\n\n===Switch to Xeon===\nAlthough SGI continued to market Itanium-based machines, its more recent machines were based on the Intel [[Xeon]] processor. The first Altix XE systems were relatively low-end machines, but by December 2006 the XE systems were more capable than the Itanium machines by some measures (e.g., power consumption in FLOPS/W, density in FLOPS/m<sup>3</sup>, cost/FLOPS). The XE1200 and XE1300 servers used a cluster architecture. This was a departure from the pure NUMA architectures of the earlier Itanium and MIPS servers.\n\nIn June 2007, SGI announced the Altix ICE 8200, a blade-based Xeon system with up to 512 Xeon cores per rack.<ref>{{cite press release| title = SGI Unveils Ultra-Dense SGI Altix ICE Blade Platform Purpose-Built for High-Performance Computing| publisher = SGI| date = June 26, 2006| url = http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2007/june/altix_ice.html| accessdate = November 26, 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022072329/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2007/june/altix_ice.html| archivedate = October 22, 2007}}</ref> An Altix ICE 8200 installed at New Mexico Computing Applications Center (with 14336 processors) ranked at number 3 on the [[TOP500]] list of November 2007.\n\n==User base and core market==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nConventional wisdom holds that SGI's core market has traditionally been [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] visual effects studios. In fact, SGI's largest [[revenue]] has always been generated by government and defense applications, energy, and scientific and technical computing.<ref>Silicon Graphics [http://www.sgi.com/company_info/federal/sewp.html \"SGI SEWP Contracts\"] Retrieved November 11, 2011.</ref> In one case Silicon Graphics' largest single sale ever was to the [[United States Postal Service]]. SGI's servers powered an [[artificial intelligence]] program to mechanically read, tag and sort the mail (hand-written and block) at a number of USPS's key mail centers. The rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]], and the availability of diverse professional software for them, effectively pushed SGI out of the visual effects industry in all but the most [[niche market]]s.\n\n==High-end server market==\nSGI continued to enhance its line of servers (including some [[supercomputer]]s) based on the [[SN architecture]]. SN, for Scalable Node, is a technology developed by SGI in the mid-1990s that uses [[Non-Uniform Memory Access#Cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA)|cache-coherent non-uniform memory access]] (cc-NUMA). In an SN system, processors, memory, and a bus- and memory-controller are coupled together into an entity called a node, usually on a single [[circuit board]]. Nodes are connected by a high-speed interconnect called [[NUMAlink]] (originally marketed as [[CrayLink]]). There is no [[internal bus]], and instead access between processors, memory, and [[I/O]] devices is done through a [[switched fabric]] of links and [[router (computing)|router]]s.\n\nThanks to the cache coherence of the [[distributed shared memory]], SN systems scale along several axes at once: as CPU count increases, so does memory capacity, I/O capacity, and system [[bisection bandwidth]]. This allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single [[Operating system|OS]] image using standard [[shared-memory synchronization]] methods. This makes an SN system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustained-to-peak performance than non-cache-coherent systems like conventional [[cluster computing|clusters]] or [[massively parallel computer]]s which require applications code to be written (or re-written) to do explicit [[message-passing]] communication between their nodes.\n\nThe first SN system, known as SN-0, was released in 1996 under the product name [[SGI Origin 2000|Origin 2000]]. Based on the MIPS [[R10000]] processor, it scaled from 2 to 128 processors and a smaller version, the [[SGI Origin 200|Origin 200]] (SN-00), scaled from 1 to 4. Later enhancements enabled systems of as large as 512 processors.\n\nThe second generation system, originally called SN-1 but later SN-MIPS, was released in July 2000, as the [[Origin 3000]]. It scaled from 4 to 512 processors, and 1,024-processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers. A smaller, less scalable implementation followed, called Origin 300.\n\nIn November 2002, SGI announced a repackaging of its SN system, under the name Origin 3900. It quadrupled the processor area density of the SN-MIPS system, from 32 up to 128 processors per rack while moving to a \"[[fat tree]]\" interconnect topology.\n\nIn January 2003, SGI announced a variant of the SN platform called the [[Altix|Altix 3000]] (internally called SN-IA). It used [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] 2 processors and ran the [[Linux]] operating system kernel. At the time it was released, it was the world's most scalable Linux-based computer, supporting up to 64 processors in a single system node.<ref>[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6440 Scaling Linux to New Heights: the SGI Altix 3000 System] Linux Journal, January 2003</ref> Nodes could be connected using the same [[NUMAlink]] technology to form what SGI predictably termed \"superclusters\".\n\nIn February 2004, SGI announced general support for 128 processor nodes to be followed by 256 and 512 processor versions that year.\n\nIn April 2004, SGI announced the sale of its Alias software business for approximately $57 million.<ref>{{cite press release\n  |url = http://www.sgi.com/newsroom/press_releases/2004/april/alias.html\n  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071205072024/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2004/april/alias.html\n  |archivedate = December 5, 2007\n  |title = Silicon Graphics Sells Alias Software Business\n  |accessdate = March 29, 2011\n  |date = April 15, 2004\n  |publisher = Silicon Graphics\n  |quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, SGI built the supercomputer [[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]], which broke the world record for computer speed, for the [[NASA Ames]] Research Center.

(A week later, [[IBM]]'s upgraded [[Blue Gene]]/L clocked in at 70.7 teraflops).\n\nIn July 2006, SGI announced an SGI Altix 4700 system with 1,024 processors and 4 [[terabyte|TB]] of memory running a

(later rebranded '''SGI''', historically known as '''Silicon Graphics Computer Systems''' or '''SGCS''') was an American [[high-performance computing]] manufacturer, producing [[computer hardware]] and [[software]]. Founded in [[Mountain View, California]] in November 1981 by [[James H. Clark|Jim Clark]], its initial market was [[3D graphics]] [[computer workstation]]s, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.\n\nEarly systems were based on the [[Geometry Engine]] that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at [[Stanford University]], and were derived from Clark's broader background in [[computer graphics]]. The Geometry Engine was the first [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) implementation of a ''[[geometry pipeline]]'', specialized hardware that accelerated the \"inner-loop\" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market.\n\nSilicon Graphics reincorporated as a [[Delaware corporation]] in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity [[Wintel]] machines began to erode SGI's stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to other platforms is a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] platforms to the [[Intel Itanium]], as well as introducing their own [[Linux]]-based [[Intel IA-32]] based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a [[supercomputer]] vendor, a move that also failed.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, SGI filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems, a deal finalized on May 11, 2009, with Rackable assuming the name [[Silicon Graphics International]]. The remains of Silicon Graphics, Inc. became Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Silicon Graphics logo.png|thumb|Silicon Graphics logo with distinctive 3-D box \"bug\"]]\n[[File:SGI LOGO.jpg|thumb]]\n{{Expand section|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[James H.

The porting of [[Maya (software)|Maya]] to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] further eroded the low end of SGI's product line.\n\nIn response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price [[Ed McCracken]] was fired and SGI brought in [[Richard Belluzzo]] to replace him. Under Belluzzo's leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = Microsoft man's shadow over bankrupt SGI\n  |author= Andrew Orlowski\n  |author-link = Andrew Orlowski\n  |date  = May 9, 2006\n  |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/09/sgi_chapter11_analysis/\n  |work=[[The Register]]\n  |accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne such initiative was trying to sell workstations running Windows NT called [[SGI Visual Workstation|Visual Workstations]] in addition to workstations running [[IRIX]], the company's version of UNIX. This put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of Dell, making it more difficult to justify a price premium. The product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later.\n\nSGI's premature announcement of its migration from MIPS to Itanium and its abortive ventures into IA-32 architecture systems (the [[SGI Visual Workstation|Visual Workstation]] line, the ex-Intergraph Zx10 range and the SGI 1000-series Linux servers) damaged SGI's credibility in the market.\n\nIn 1999, in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company, Silicon Graphics Inc. changed its corporate identity to \"SGI\", although its legal name was unchanged.\n\nAt the same time, SGI announced a new logo consisting of only the letters \"sgi\" in a proprietary font called \"SGI\", created by branding and design consulting firm [[Landor Associates]], in collaboration with designer Joe Stitzlein. SGI continued to use the \"Silicon Graphics\" name for its workstation product line, and later re-adopted the cube logo for some workstation models.\n\nIn November 2005, SGI announced that it had been delisted from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange. SGI's [[market capitalization]] dwindled from a peak of over seven [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] dollars in 1995 to just $120 million at the time of delisting. In February 2006, SGI noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title = SGI's Future Could Include Bankruptcy, Sale|url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1925129,00.asp|work = ExtremeTech|date = February 10, 2006|accessdate = November 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Re-emergence===\nIn mid-2005, SGI hired Alix Partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit. SGI announced it was postponing its scheduled annual December stockholders meeting until March 2006. It proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn January 2006, SGI hired Dennis McKenna as its new CEO and chairman of the board of directors. Mr. McKenna succeeded [[Robert Bishop (manager)|Robert Bishop]], who remained vice chairman of the board of directors.\n\nOn May 8, 2006, SGI announced that it had filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection for itself and U.S. subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by $250 million.<ref>Patrick Fitzgerald.

They may have used the PM2 CPU and PM2M1 RAM board from the 2000 series. The usual monitor for the 1000 series ran at 30&nbsp;Hz [[interlaced]]. Six beta-test units of the 1400 workstation were produced, and the first production unit (SGI's first commercial computer) was shipped to Carnegie-Mellon University's Electronic Imaging Laboratory in 1984.\n\n====IRIS 2000 and 3000 series====\n[[File:SGI-geometry-engine-chip.jpg|thumb|Geometry Engine chip from an IRIS 3120]]\n\nSGI rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line \u2014 the IRIS 2000 series, first released in August 1985.<ref>{{cite web| title = Iris 2000 Systems| publisher = SGIstuff.net| author = Gerhard Lenerz| url = http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/systems/iris2000.html| accessdate = January 4, 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120218035434/http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/systems/iris2000.html| archive-date = February 18, 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> SGI began using the [[UNIX System V]] [[operating system]]. There were five models in two product ranges, the 2000/2200/2300/2400/2500 range which used [[Motorola 68010|68010 CPUs]] (the PM2 CPU module), and the later \"Turbo\" systems, the 2300T, 2400T and 2500T, which had [[Motorola 68020|68020s]] (the IP2 CPU module). All used the Excelan EXOS/201 Ethernet card, the same graphics hardware (GF2 Frame Buffer, UC4 Update Controller, DC4 Display Controller, BP3 Bitplane). Their main differences were the CPU, RAM, and [[Weitek]] [[Math coprocessor|Floating Point Accelerator]] boards, disk controllers and disk drives (both [[ST-506]] and [[Storage Module Device|SMD]] were available). These could be upgraded, for example from a 2400 to a 2400T. The 2500 and 2500T had a larger chassis, a standard 6' 19\" EIA rack with space at the bottom for two SMD disk drives weighing approximately {{nowrap|68 kg}} each.<ref>http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/sgi/iris/IRIS_FAQ.txt</ref> The non-Turbo models used the [[Multibus]] for the CPU to communicate with the floating point accelerator, while the Turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this. 60&nbsp;Hz monitors were used for the 2000 series.\n\nThe height of the machines using Motorola CPUs was reached with the IRIS 3000 series (models 3010/3020/3030 and 3110/3115/3120/3130, the 30s both being full-size rack machines). They used the same graphics subsystem and Ethernet as the 2000s, but could also use up to 12 \"geometry engines\", the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators. The standard monitor was a 19\" 60&nbsp;Hz non-interlaced unit with a tilt/swivel base; 19\" 30&nbsp;Hz interlaced and a 15\" 60&nbsp;Hz non-interlaced (with tilt/swivel base) were also available.\n\nThe IRIS 3130 and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time, being complete [[UNIX]] workstations. The 3130 was powerful enough to support a complete 3D animation and rendering package without mainframe support. With large capacity hard drives by standards of the day (two 300 MB drives), streaming tape and Ethernet, it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation.\n\nThe line was formally discontinued in November 1989, with about 3500 systems shipped of all 2000 and 3000 models combined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silicon Graphics IRIS 2000/3000 FAQ|author=Jonathan Levine|url=http://www.sgistuff.net/mirrors/irisfaq/index.php |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===RISC era===\nWith the introduction of the IRIS 4D series, SGI switched to [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] microprocessors. These machines were more powerful and came with powerful on-board floating-point capability. As 3D graphics became more popular in television and film during this time, these systems were responsible for establishing much of SGI's reputation.\n\nSGI produced a broad range of MIPS-based workstations and servers during the 1990s, running SGI's version of UNIX System V, now called [[IRIX]]. These included the massive Onyx visualization systems, the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to 64 processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution, fully realized 3D graphics.\n\nIn October 1991, MIPS announced the first commercially available [[64-bit]] microprocessor, the [[R4000]]. SGI used the R4000 in its [[SGI Crimson|Crimson]] workstation. IRIX 6.2 was the first fully 64-bit IRIX release, including 64-bit pointers.\n\nTo secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors (the 64-bit [[R4000]]), SGI acquired the company in 1992<ref>PC Magazine. \"[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=SGI&i=51221,00.asp SGI].\" Retrieved September 19, 2011.</ref> for $333 million<ref name=CHM>Computer History Museum. \"[http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/story/219 Silicon Graphics Professional IRIS 4D/50GT].\" Retrieved September 19, 2011.</ref><ref>Cate Corcoran (March 16, 1992), MIPS, Silicon merger could kill ACE/ARC, ''InfoWorld'', pp. 1 and 107.

The deal was signed in early 1993, and it was later made public in August of that year.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Outsiders|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|pages=61\u201362}}</ref> The console itself was later released in 1996. The RCP was developed by SGI's Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer [[Wei Yen|Dr. Wei Yen]]. In 1997, twenty SGI employees, led by Yen, left SGI and founded [[ArtX]] (later acquired by [[ATI Technologies]] in 2000).<ref name=\"It's Alive\">{{cite web | title=It's Alive! | date=March 12, 1999 | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/13/its-alive-3 | accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, SGI relinquished some ownership of MIPS Technologies, Inc in a [[Reverse IPO|Re-IPO]], and fully divested itself in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=SGI and MIPS Technologies Announce Spin-Off of MIPS Shares. - Free Online Library|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/SGI+and+MIPS+Technologies+Announce+Spin-Off+of+MIPS+Shares.-a062436955|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, when much of the industry expected the [[Itanium]] to replace both [[Complex instruction set computing|CISC]] and [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] architectures in non-embedded computers, SGI announced their intent to phase out MIPS in their systems. Development of new MIPS microprocessors stopped, and the existing [[R12000]] design was extended multiple times until 2003 to provide existing customers more time to migrate to Itanium.\n\nIn August 2006, SGI announced the end of production for MIPS/IRIX systems,<ref>\n[http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html End of General Availability for MIPS IRIX Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307153053/http://www.sgi.com/support/mips_irix.html |date=March 7, 2008 }} at sgi.com</ref> and by the end of the year MIPS/IRIX products were no longer generally available from SGI.\n\n===IRIS GL and OpenGL===\nUntil the second generation Onyx [[RealityEngine|Reality Engine]] machines, SGI offered access to its high performance 3D graphics subsystems through a proprietary [[Application programming interface|API]] known as ''IRIS Graphics Language'' ([[IRIS GL]]). As more features were added over the years, IRIS GL became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use. In 1992, SGI decided to clean up and reform IRIS GL and made the bold move of allowing the resulting [[OpenGL]] API to be cheaply licensed by SGI's competitors, and set up an industry-wide consortium to maintain the OpenGL standard (the OpenGL Architecture Review Board).\n\nThis meant that for the first time, fast, efficient, cross-platform graphics programs could be written. To this day, OpenGL remains the only real-time 3D graphics standard to be portable across a variety of operating systems. OpenGL-ES even runs on many types of cell phones. Its main competitor ([[Direct3D]] from Microsoft) runs only on [[Microsoft Windows]]-based machines and some consoles.\n\n===ACE Consortium===\n{{main|Advanced Computing Environment}}\n\nSGI was part of the Advanced Computing Environment initiative, formed in the early 1990s with 20 other companies, including [[Compaq]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[MIPS Computer Systems]], [[Groupe Bull]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[NEC Corporation|NEC]], [[NeTpower]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Santa Cruz Operation]]. Its intent was to introduce workstations based on the [[MIPS architecture]] and able to run [[Windows NT]] and [[SCO UNIX]]. The group produced the [[Advanced RISC Computing]] (ARC) specification, but began to unravel little more than a year after its formation.\n\n===Entertainment industry===\nFor eight consecutive years (1995\u20132002), all films nominated for an Academy Award for Distinguished Achievement in Visual Effects were created on Silicon Graphics computer systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/news/video_sgi_sweeps_academy|title=News, Features, Reviews, Forums and Resources for the Professional Content Creator - Creative Planet Network|website=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}</ref> the technology was also used in commercials for [[Energizer Holdings|Energizer]], [[Benson & Hedges]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Pepsi]], [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[McDonald's]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Canada Dry]], [[Post Consumer Brands|Honey Comb]], [[Gatorade]], [[The Hershey Company|Reese's]], [[Pillsbury Doughboy]], \"Bud Bowl\", \"Scrubbing Bubbles\", [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[Dodge]], [[United Airlines]], and [[DHL Express|DHL]].\n\nAn [[SGI Crimson]] system with the [[fsn (file manager)|fsn]]<ref>[http://www.siliconbunny.com/fsn-the-irix-3d-file-system-tool-from-jurassic-park/ FSN \u2014 File System Navigator] at siliconbunny.com</ref> [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] file system navigator appeared in the 1993 movie ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgistuff.net/funstuff/hollywood/jpark.html|title=sgistuff.net|author=Gerhard Lenerz|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the movie ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', protagonists can be seen using an SGI laptop computer; however, the unit shown was not an actual working computer, but rather a fake laptop shell built around an SGI Corona LCD flat screen display.<ref>[http://www.bftr.com/Pages/projects/twister.html Banned From the Ranch Entertainment&nbsp;\u2014 Twister] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820193238/http://www.bftr.com/Pages/projects/twister.html |date=August 20, 2008 }} at bftr.com.</ref>\n\nThe 1995 film ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]'' also features an SGI laptop computer being used by Dr. Ross ([[Laura Linney]]) to communicate via satellite to TraviCom HQ.<ref>[http://www.siliconbunny.com/silicon-graphics-laptops/ SGI Laptops] at siliconbunny.com</ref>\n\nThe purple, lowercased \"'''sgi'''\" logo can be seen at the beginning of the opening credits of the [[HBO]] series [[Silicon Valley (TV series)|''Silicon Valley'']], before being taken down and replaced by the [[Google]] logo as the intro graphics progress. Google leased the former SGI buildings in 2003 for their headquarters in Mountain View, CA until they purchased the buildings outright in 2006.\n\nOnce inexpensive PCs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were SGI's core business, SGI shifted its focus to high performance servers for [[digital video]] and the Web. Many SGI graphics engineers left to work at other computer graphics companies such as [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] and [[Nvidia]], contributing to the PC 3D graphics revolution.\n\n===Free software===\nSGI was a promoter of [[free software]],{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} supporting several projects such as [[Linux (kernel)|Linux]] and [[Samba software|Samba]], and opening some of its own previously proprietary code such as the [[XFS]] filesystem and the [[Open64]] compiler.\n\nSGI was also important in its contribution to the C++ [[Standard Template Library]] (STL) with many useful extensions in the [[MIT License|MIT-like licensed]] SGI STL implementation. The extension keeps being carried by the direct descendant [[STLport]] and GNU's libstdc++.<ref>{{cite web |title=SGI Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide |url=https://www.boost.org/sgi/stl/index.html |accessdate=9 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Acquisition of Alias, Wavefront, Cray and Intergraph===\nIn 1995, SGI purchased Alias Research, [[Kroyer Films]], and [[Wavefront Technologies]] in a deal totaling approximately $500 million and merged the companies into Alias|Wavefront. In June 2004 SGI sold the business, later renamed to [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias/Wavefront]], to the private equity investment firm [[Accel-KKR]] for $57.1 million. In October 2005, [[Autodesk]] announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alias for $182 million in cash.\n\nIn February 1996, SGI purchased the well-known [[supercomputer]] manufacturer [[Cray Research]] for $740 million,<ref>David Einstein, [https://www.forbes.com/2000/03/03/mu4.html Could SGI Be A Takeover Target?] Forbes, March 2000.\n</ref> and began to use marketing names such as \"CrayLink\" for (SGI-developed) technology integrated into the SGI server line. Three months later, it sold the [[Cray Business Systems Division]], responsible for the [[CS6400]] SPARC/Solaris server, to [[Sun Microsystems]] for an undisclosed amount (acknowledged later by a Sun executive to be \"significantly less than $100 million\").<ref>{{cite press release\n  |title= Sun Microsystems announces intent to purchase Cray Business Systems Division\n  |publisher= Sun Microsystems\n  |date= May 17, 1996\n  |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sun+Microsystems+Announces+Intent+to+Purchase+Cray+Business+Systems...-a018293601\n  |accessdate= March 20, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | author1 = Lisa DiCarlo \n | title = Sun's Purchase Of Cray's Unix Server Business\n | url = https://www.forbes.com/2002/05/06/0506sun.html#67fc068a6a5e\n | work = [[Forbes]]\n | date = 2002-05-06\n | accessdate = 2019-01-24\n | quote = \n}}</ref> Many of the [[Cray T3E]] engineers designed and developed the [[SGI Altix]] and [[NUMAlink]] technology.

The product line was discontinued in June 2001.\n\n===SGI Visual Workstations===\nAnother attempt by SGI in the late 1990s to introduce its own family of Intel-based workstations running [[Windows NT]] or [[Red Hat Linux]] (see also [[SGI Visual Workstation]]) proved to be a financial disaster, and shook customer confidence in SGI's commitment to its own MIPS-based line.\n\n===Switch to Itanium===\nIn 1998, SGI announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own MIPS processors, but the upcoming \"super-chip\" from [[Intel]], code-named \"Merced\" and later called [[Itanium]]. Funding for its own high-end processors was reduced, and it was planned that the [[R10000]] would be the last MIPS mainstream processor. [[MIPS Technologies]] would focus entirely on the embedded market, where it was having some success, and SGI would no longer have to fund development of a CPU that, since the failure of [[Advanced RISC Computing|ARC]], found use only in their own machines. This plan quickly went awry. As early as 1999 it was clear the Itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected. As the production delays increased, MIPS' existing R10000-based machines grew increasingly uncompetitive. Eventually it was forced to introduce faster MIPS processors, the [[R10000#R12000|R12000]], [[R10000#R14000|R14000]] and [[R10000#R16000|R16000]], which were used in a series of models from 2002 through 2006.\n\nSGI's first Itanium-based system was the short-lived SGI 750 workstation, launched in 2001. SGI's MIPS-based systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the [[Itanium 2]]-based [[SGI Altix|Altix]] servers and [[SGI Prism|Prism]] workstations some time later. Unlike the MIPS systems, which ran [[IRIX]], the Itanium systems used [[SuSE Linux|SuSE Linux Enterprise Server]] with SGI enhancements as their [[operating system]]. SGI used [[Transitive Corporation]]'s [[QuickTransit]] software to allow their old MIPS/IRIX applications to run (in emulation) on the new Itanium/Linux platform.\n\nIn the server market the Itanium 2-based Altix eventually replaced the MIPS-based Origin product line. In the workstation market, the switch to Itanium was not completed before SGI exited the market.\n\nThe Altix was the most powerful computer in the world in 2006, assuming that a \"computer\" is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system. The Altix had 512 Itanium processors running under a single instance of [[Linux]]. A cluster of 20 machines was then the eighth-fastest [[supercomputer]]. All faster supercomputers were clusters, but none have as many [[FLOPS]] per machine. However, more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable. SGI acknowledged this and in 2007 moved away from the \"massive [[Non-Uniform Memory Access|NUMA]]\" model to clusters.\n\n===Switch to Xeon===\nAlthough SGI continued to market Itanium-based machines, its more recent machines were based on the Intel [[Xeon]] processor. The first Altix XE systems were relatively low-end machines, but by December 2006 the XE systems were more capable than the Itanium machines by some measures (e.g., power consumption in FLOPS/W, density in FLOPS/m<sup>3</sup>, cost/FLOPS). The XE1200 and XE1300 servers used a cluster architecture. This was a departure from the pure NUMA architectures of the earlier Itanium and MIPS servers.\n\nIn June 2007, SGI announced the Altix ICE 8200, a blade-based Xeon system with up to 512 Xeon cores per rack.<ref>{{cite press release| title = SGI Unveils Ultra-Dense SGI Altix ICE Blade Platform Purpose-Built for High-Performance Computing| publisher = SGI| date = June 26, 2006| url = http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2007/june/altix_ice.html| accessdate = November 26, 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022072329/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2007/june/altix_ice.html| archivedate = October 22, 2007}}</ref> An Altix ICE 8200 installed at New Mexico Computing Applications Center (with 14336 processors) ranked at number 3 on the [[TOP500]] list of November 2007.\n\n==User base and core market==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nConventional wisdom holds that SGI's core market has traditionally been [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] visual effects studios. In fact, SGI's largest [[revenue]] has always been generated by government and defense applications, energy, and scientific and technical computing.<ref>Silicon Graphics [http://www.sgi.com/company_info/federal/sewp.html \"SGI SEWP Contracts\"] Retrieved November 11, 2011.</ref> In one case Silicon Graphics' largest single sale ever was to the [[United States Postal Service]]. SGI's servers powered an [[artificial intelligence]] program to mechanically read, tag and sort the mail (hand-written and block) at a number of USPS's key mail centers. The rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]], and the availability of diverse professional software for them, effectively pushed SGI out of the visual effects industry in all but the most [[niche market]]s.\n\n==High-end server market==\nSGI continued to enhance its line of servers (including some [[supercomputer]]s) based on the [[SN architecture]]. SN, for Scalable Node, is a technology developed by SGI in the mid-1990s that uses [[Non-Uniform Memory Access#Cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA)|cache-coherent non-uniform memory access]] (cc-NUMA). In an SN system, processors, memory, and a bus- and memory-controller are coupled together into an entity called a node, usually on a single [[circuit board]]. Nodes are connected by a high-speed interconnect called [[NUMAlink]] (originally marketed as [[CrayLink]]). There is no [[internal bus]], and instead access between processors, memory, and [[I/O]] devices is done through a [[switched fabric]] of links and [[router (computing)|router]]s.\n\nThanks to the cache coherence of the [[distributed shared memory]], SN systems scale along several axes at once: as CPU count increases, so does memory capacity, I/O capacity, and system [[bisection bandwidth]]. This allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single [[Operating system|OS]] image using standard [[shared-memory synchronization]] methods. This makes an SN system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustained-to-peak performance than non-cache-coherent systems like conventional [[cluster computing|clusters]] or [[massively parallel computer]]s which require applications code to be written (or re-written) to do explicit [[message-passing]] communication between their nodes.\n\nThe first SN system, known as SN-0, was released in 1996 under the product name [[SGI Origin 2000|Origin 2000]]. Based on the MIPS [[R10000]] processor, it scaled from 2 to 128 processors and a smaller version, the [[SGI Origin 200|Origin 200]] (SN-00), scaled from 1 to 4. Later enhancements enabled systems of as large as 512 processors.\n\nThe second generation system, originally called SN-1 but later SN-MIPS, was released in July 2000, as the [[Origin 3000]]. It scaled from 4 to 512 processors, and 1,024-processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers. A smaller, less scalable implementation followed, called Origin 300.\n\nIn November 2002, SGI announced a repackaging of its SN system, under the name Origin 3900. It quadrupled the processor area density of the SN-MIPS system, from 32 up to 128 processors per rack while moving to a \"[[fat tree]]\" interconnect topology.\n\nIn January 2003, SGI announced a variant of the SN platform called the [[Altix|Altix 3000]] (internally called SN-IA). It used [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] 2 processors and ran the [[Linux]] operating system kernel. At the time it was released, it was the world's most scalable Linux-based computer, supporting up to 64 processors in a single system node.<ref>[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6440 Scaling Linux to New Heights: the SGI Altix 3000 System] Linux Journal, January 2003</ref> Nodes could be connected using the same [[NUMAlink]] technology to form what SGI predictably termed \"superclusters\".\n\nIn February 2004, SGI announced general support for 128 processor nodes to be followed by 256 and 512 processor versions that year.\n\nIn April 2004, SGI announced the sale of its Alias software business for approximately $57 million.<ref>{{cite press release\n  |url = http://www.sgi.com/newsroom/press_releases/2004/april/alias.html\n  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071205072024/http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2004/april/alias.html\n  |archivedate = December 5, 2007\n  |title = Silicon Graphics Sells Alias Software Business\n  |accessdate = March 29, 2011\n  |date = April 15, 2004\n  |publisher = Silicon Graphics\n  |quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, SGI built the supercomputer [[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]], which broke the world record for computer speed, for the [[NASA Ames]] Research Center.
