The game was one of the first mass-produced, three-dimensional board games.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coopee|first1=Todd|title=Mouse Trap|url=https://toytales.ca/mouse-trap/|website=ToyTales.ca}}</ref> Over the course of the game, players at first cooperate to build a working [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg]]\u2013like [[mouse trap]].  Once the mouse trap has been built, players turn against each other, attempting to trap opponents' [[mouse]]-shaped game pieces.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n=== Original version ===\nThe basic premise of the game has been consistent over time, but the turn-based gameplay has changed. The original version, designed by Hank Kramer of [[Ideal Toy Company]], allows the players almost no decision-making, in keeping with other games for very young children such as ''[[Candyland]]'' or ''[[Snakes and Ladders|Chutes and Ladders]]'' (''Snakes and Ladders''). Players take turns rolling a die to advance their mouse piece along a path around the game board, from the start space to a continuous loop at the end. The [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg]]-like mouse trap is assembled in the center of the board, with players adding one or more of its pieces when they land on specified \"build\" spaces. The trap is always assembled in a specified order, and is attached to the board by inserting tabs into holes and locking them into place.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-1963\"/>\n\nAlong the ending loop are addition \"build\" spaces (in case the trap is still not completed), a \"cheese\" space positioned directly underneath the trap's cage, and a \"turn crank\" space. If a player lands on the \"turn crank\" space when an opponent is on the \"cheese\" space, the crank can be turned on the machine to launch it and trap that opponent. The winner is then the last one remaining after all the other players are captured.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-1963\">{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2679/mouse-trap|title=Mouse Trap (1963)|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref>\n\n=== Revised versions ===\nIn 1975, the board game surrounding the Mouse Trap was redesigned by [[Sid Sackson]], adding the cheese pieces and allowing the player to maneuver opponents onto the trap space.<ref name=\"A Board Game Education\">{{cite book|title=A Board Game Education|last=Hinebaugh|first=Jeffrey|year=2009|publisher=R&L Education|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvqw9vK0R8sC|access-date=18 January 2013}}</ref>{{rp|36}} Players collect cheese-shaped tokens during the game, and if the trap space is vacant when they land on the \"turn crank\" space, the tokens can be redeemed for a die roll to move an opponent.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-1963\"/>\n\nA modified version was released in the United Kingdom in 2004, featuring three mousetraps (with a specialized trigger working at random) and a completely different board and plastic components.<ref name=\"A Board Game Education\"/>{{rp|38}} Among the changed trap components in this version is the inclusion of a model toilet instead of a model bathtub.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-2004\">{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24985/mouse-trap|title=Mouse Trap (2004)|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref>\n\nA version of the game featuring characters from the ''[[Elefun]] and Friends'' universe was introduced in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101141912/http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony/en_US/shop/details.cfm?R=6F8F1F83-5056-9047-F549-B780AB71DD61:en_US|title=Elefun and Friends Mouse Trap &#124; Games for ages 4 YEARS & UP &#124; Hasbro|date=November 1, 2014|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jinxykids.com/mouse-trap/|title=New Mouse Trap Elefun & Friends Game Review|date=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Among the changes in this version, the trap is built before the start of the game, a spin wheel is used instead of dice, and the cheese pieces and their relevant rules are not included.<ref name=\"boardgamegeek-Elefun\">{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/184159/elefun-friends-mouse-trap|title=Elefun & Friends Mouse Trap|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the 2010s, Hasbro introduced ''Classic Mousetrap'' with several major changes from the previous versions.
