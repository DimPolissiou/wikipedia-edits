Phipson, businessman, naturalist, and longtime editor of the ''[[Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society]]''.]]\n'''Herbert Musgrave Phipson''' (1850 \u2013 7 August 1936), was a British wine merchant and naturalist who lived in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]), [[India]], from 1878 to 1905.  As the honorary secretary of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]], editor of its ''[[JBNHS|Journal]]'', and manager of the Society's business and outreach activities, he played an important role in not only establishing the journal's status as the foremost [[natural history]] journal in Asia, but also influencing public science policy in the [[Bombay Presidency]].<ref name=obit/> His efforts saw fruition in the establishment of the Natural Sciences section of the [[Prince of Wales Museum of Western India]].  Phipson, who was married to the pioneering physician [[Edith Pechey-Phipson]], also co-founded, with his wife, the Pechey Phipson Sanitarium for Women and Children in [[Nasik]], India.<ref name=obit>{{Harvnb|Anon|1937}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nPhipson was born in London in 1850 and educated at [[Clifton College]].  He went out to India in 1878 as a partner in the firm of J. A. Forbes & Co., [[Bombay]].  Five years later, he established his own company, Phipson & Co. Wine Merchants.  He joined the [[Bombay Natural History Society]] (BNHS) in 1884 and in 1886 became both the Society's honorary secretary and the editor of its journal.  He married Dr. [[Edith Pechey]] MD, head physician at the [[Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Group of Hospitals|Cama Hospital for Women and Children]], Bombay in 1889.  In 1906, he and his wife returned to England, on account of her ill-health, to which, however, she succumbed two years later.<ref name=obit/>\n\n==Bombay Natural History Society==\n[[Image:Phipson paperA.jpg|left|thumb|300px|'''Figure 1'''.  A short note by Phipson on [[Gerarda prevostiana|Gerard's water snake]].]]\nPhipson was visiting England when the Bombay Natural History Society was founded on 15 September 1883.  Upon his return to Bombay, he immediately joined BNHS and in January 1884 offered office space belonging to his business as a permanent home for the Society.  Two years later, when the need was felt for BNHS to expand, he again offered the Society part of the larger premises he had acquired for his business at 6 Apollo Street, Bombay.  This was to be BNHS's home for the next fifty years.<ref name=obit/> From March 1886, when he succeeded [[E. H. Aitken]] as honorary secretary, to April 1906 when he returned to England, Phipson was the driving force behind the Society.  He served as the editor of the ''[[Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society]]'' for twenty years \u2013 as the sole editor for fifteen years and then joint editor with [[W. S. Millard]] who succeeded him as honorary secretary.  His own main area of interest was snakes and, in spite of being tied down by his business and BNHS work, he found time to write the occasional note.<ref>{{Harvnb|Phipson|1887a}}, {{Harvnb|Phipson|1887b}}</ref> See, for example, the humorous short note {{Harv|Phipson|1887b}} displayed in Figure 1, which lays claim for the familiar shores of Bombay to be included among the authenticated habitats of [[Gerarda prevostiana|Gerard's water snake]], which until then had been recorded only in [[Pegu]], Burma.\n\n==Academic and Public Science==\nPhipson spent most of his BNHS-related work in three activities: on increasing the Society's reputation in the natural sciences by the publication of high-quality articles in its journal; on increasing the Society's importance to zoologists by building up its collections of both live animals and specimens; and on stepping up the society's public service efforts though its meetings and displays.  During his tenure his editor, the journal became the best known natural history journal in Asia.  The BNHS's ever increasing collection of live animals gave Phipson the idea of establishing a Society-managed zoological gardens in Bombay; this effort, however, failed, as the Bombay Municipality did not agree to the site selected by Phipson for the proposed zoo.<ref name=obit/>  A few years later Phipson was appointed to a committee charged with determining the feasibility of a public museum and library for Bombay.  At one of the committee meetings, he proposed that three separate buildings be established, one each for an arts and archaeology museum, a public library, and a [[natural history]] museum.  Phipson's proposal, including the site selected by him and the proposal for a separate building for natural history, was incorporated into the committee's final report presented in 1904; it found concrete expression in the inauguration in 1922 of the [[Prince of Wales Museum of Western India]], many of whose natural history collections were both donated and managed by BNHS.<ref name=obit/>\n<Center>\n<Gallery>\nImage:Hydrophis phipsoniiB.jpg|'''Figure 2'''.

Kittredge, an American businessman in Bombay, had inaugurated the \"Medical Women for India Fund.\" The goal of the fund was to bring women physicians from England to work at a proposed medical institution for women and children in Bombay, which was to be staffed entirely by women, and to simultaneously lobby the University of Bombay, and its medical college to admit Indian women for medical education.<ref name=lutzker43>{{Harvnb|Lutzker|1967|p=43}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Kittredge, George|title=A short history of the \"Medical Women for India\" fund of Bombay|year=1889|publisher=Education Society's Press|place=Bombay|url=https://archive.org/stream/39002011128098.med.yale.edu#page/n1/mode/2up}}</ref> Phipson joined the Fund, and soon became its secretary.  It was through his activities at the Fund that Phipson met his future wife, [[Edith Pechey]], who had just arrived in Bombay as Senior Physician at the [[Grant Medical College and Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Group of Hospitals|Cama Hospital for Women and Children]].  He and Edith were married in March 1889.<ref name=lutzker43/>\n[[Image:Phrynichus phipsoni \u2013 Pocock, 1900.png|left|thumb| The [[amblypygid|Whip scorpion]], ''Phyrynichus phipsoni'' described by {{Harvnb|Pocock|1900}}]]\nTwo years later, Phipson and Edith founded the Pechey-Phipson Sanatorium for Women and Children on the premises of their summer estate in [[Nasik]], approximately {{convert|120|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} north of Bombay, where they found the climate more hospitable.<ref name=lutzker/> Here they constructed a convalescent community \u2013 with almost two dozen cottages, a working-girls' hostel, and a library \u2013 to which families or individuals that lacked the means to escape the \"heat of the Bombay summer were invited to come for a month's stay; convalescent women and children especially were encouraged to take advantage of a health-renewing sojourn\"<ref name=lutzker>{{Harvnb|Lutzker|1967|p=44}}</ref> at no rent and at nominal cost. Newspapers in Bombay advertised these accommodations and interested readers were asked to apply to Phipson and Co. for further arrangements.<ref name=lutzker/>\n\n==Return to England==\nBy 1905, Edith's health had begun to fail and both Phipson and Edith made a decision to retire and return to England.  The following year, they sailed from Bombay to London with stops in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In August 1906, soon after their return to England, Edith joined the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|Women's Suffrage Association of Leeds]], and they both attended the conference of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance in Copenhagen.<ref name=anagol>{{Harvnb|Anagol|2004}}</ref> They also participated in the [[Mud March (Suffragists)|Mud March]] organised by the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] in February 1907.  By this time Edith was seriously ill with breast cancer and diabetes and underwent surgery for the cancer.  Although successful for the cancer, the surgery could not save Edith's life, and she died in a diabetic coma on 14 April 1908 at their home in Folkestone, Kent.<ref name=anagol/>\nIn 1910, two years after Edith's death, Phipson established a scholarship in\nher name at the [[London School of Medicine for Women]].  The scholarship, initially valued at \u00a340 per year, and increased in 1919 to \u00a3100 per year, was awarded annually to a medical student, \"preferably to one coming from India or going to work in India.\"<ref name=anagol/> The \"Edith Pechey Phipson scholarship register\" was to remain in place from 1912 to 1948.  The \"Pechey-Phipson Sanatorium for Women and Children\" in [[Nasik]], which Phipson had founded with Edith in 1891, continued to function until 1964.<ref name=anagol/>\n\nIn 1916, during BNHS's \"Mammal Survey of India, Burma and Ceylon,\" the Indian race of the flying squirrel ''[[Petinomys vordermanni]]'' was named ''Petinomys phipsoni'' by [[Oldfield Thomas]], who in the introduction to his paper said, \"I have named this beautiful little animal in honour of Mr. H.

The front pair of legs are modified for use as antennae-like feelers, with many fine segments giving the appearance of a \"whip\". When a suitable prey is located with the antenniform legs, the amblypygid seizes its victim with large spines on the grasping [[pedipalp]]s, impaling and immobilizing the prey. This is typically done while climbing the side of a vertical surface and looking downward at their prey.<ref name=\"Ladle2003\">{{Cite journal |last=Ladle |first=Richard J. |last2=Velander |first2=Kathryn |date=2003 |title=Fishing behavior in a giant whip spider |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289037904 |journal=The Journal of Arachnology |volume=31 |pages=154\u2013156 |via=ResearchGate|doi=10.1636/0161-8202(2003)031[0154:FBIAGW]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> Pincer-like [[chelicerae]] then work to grind and chew the prey prior to ingestion.

Black waters are more [[acid]]ic, resulting in an [[aluminum]] concentration greater than that of the more neutral white waters.  The major difference is the concentrations of [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and [[potassium]]; these are very low in black waters.  This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, [[snail]]s, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], similar to that of rainwater.\n\nBlack and white waters differ in their [[plankton]]ic fauna and flora. [[#table2|Tables 2]] and [[#table3|3]] compare the number of planktonic animals caught in black and white water localities only a few meters apart. The black water was not as extreme an example as the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] system. However, it can be seen that the black water held greater numbers of [[rotifer]]s but fewer [[crustacean]]s and [[mite]]s. These crustaceans are important foods for [[larval fish]]. The zones where the two waters mix are attractive to [[ostracod]]s and young fish. These mixing zones tend to have many animals. The abundance is shown in Table{{nbsp}}3, which compares animals in {{convert|10|l}} of water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Comparison between white and black waters |accessdate=2006-05-21 |url=http://www.amazonian-fish.co.uk/indexc30.html |work=Amazonian Fishes and their Habitats |publisher=Pisces Conservation Ltd |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716122850/http://www.amazonian-fish.co.uk/indexc30.html |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{| id=\"table2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|+ Table 2: Planktonic organisms collected in black ([[Japura River|Japura]]) and white ([[Solim\u00f5es River|Solim\u00f5es]]) waters.<ref name=\"Darwich\" />\n|-\n!

Black waters are more [[acid]]ic, resulting in an [[aluminum]] concentration greater than that of the more neutral white waters.  The major difference is the concentrations of [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and [[potassium]]; these are very low in black waters.  This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, [[snail]]s, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], similar to that of rainwater.\n\nBlack and white waters differ in their [[plankton]]ic fauna and flora. [[#table2|Tables 2]] and [[#table3|3]] compare the number of planktonic animals caught in black and white water localities only a few meters apart. The black water was not as extreme an example as the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] system. However, it can be seen that the black water held greater numbers of [[rotifer]]s but fewer [[crustacean]]s and [[mite]]s. These crustaceans are important foods for [[larval fish]]. The zones where the two waters mix are attractive to [[ostracod]]s and young fish. These mixing zones tend to have many animals. The abundance is shown in Table{{nbsp}}3, which compares animals in {{convert|10|l}} of water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Comparison between white and black waters |accessdate=2006-05-21 |url=http://www.amazonian-fish.co.uk/indexc30.html |work=Amazonian Fishes and their Habitats |publisher=Pisces Conservation Ltd |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716122850/http://www.amazonian-fish.co.uk/indexc30.html |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n{| id=\"table2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\"\n|+ Table 2: Planktonic organisms collected in black ([[Japura River|Japura]]) and white ([[Solim\u00f5es River|Solim\u00f5es]]) waters.<ref name=\"Darwich\" />\n|-\n!
