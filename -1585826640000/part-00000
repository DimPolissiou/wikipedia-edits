By the 1970s he had begun incorporating [[jazz]] and [[rock music|rock]] into his sound on albums such as ''[[Solid Air]]'' (1973) and ''[[One World (John Martyn album)|One World]]'' (1977), as well as experimenting with [[guitar effects]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] machines such as [[Echoplex]].<ref name=\"all\">{{cite web|last1=Hartenbach|first1=Brett|title=John Martyn: Biography & History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-martyn-mn0000196969/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> He struggled with substance abuse and domestic problems throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though continued to release albums while collaborating with figures such as [[Phil Collins]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]].

By 1970 Martyn had developed a wholly original and idiosyncratic sound: acoustic guitar run through a [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]], phase shifter and [[Echoplex]]. This sound was first apparent on ''[[Stormbringer! (John and Beverley Martyn album)|Stormbringer!]]'' in 1970, which was written and performed by Martyn and his then-wife Beverley, who had previously recorded solo as [[Beverley Martyn|Beverley Kutner]]. Her second album with Martyn was ''[[The Road to Ruin (John and Beverley Martyn album)|The Road to Ruin]]'', also released in 1970. Island Records felt that it would be more successful to market Martyn as a solo act and this was how subsequent albums were produced, although Beverley continued to make appearances as a backing singer as well as continuing as a solo artist herself.<ref name=\"timesobit\"/>\n\n==1970s==\n{{listen\n| filename     = John Martyn Eibhli.ogg\n| title        = \"Eibhli Ghail Chiuin Ni Chearbhail\"\n| description  = \"Eibhli Ghail Chiuin Ni Chearbhail\" (1973), built around a traditional tune, was featured on ''Inside Out''.

In 2009, a double CD Deluxe edition of ''Solid Air'' was released featuring unreleased songs and out-takes, and sleeve notes by Record Collector's Daryl Easlea. On ''Solid Air'', as with the one that preceded it, ''[[Bless the Weather]]'', Martyn collaborated with [[jazz]] bassist [[Danny Thompson]], with whom he proceeded to have a musical partnership which continued until his death. \n\nFollowing the commercial success of ''Solid Air'', Martyn quickly recorded and released the experimental ''[[Inside Out (John Martyn album)|Inside Out]]'', an album with emphasis placed on feel and improvisation rather than song structure. In 1975, he followed this with ''[[Sunday's Child]]'', a more song-based collection \"My Baby Girl\", \"Spencer the Rover\", with several references to his young family. Martyn subsequently described this period as 'very happy'. In September 1975 he released a live album, ''[[Live at Leeds (John Martyn album)|Live at Leeds]]'' \u2014 Martyn had been unable to persuade Island to release the record, and resorted to selling individually signed copies by mail from his home in Hastings. ''Live at Leeds'' features Danny Thompson and drummer [[John Stevens (drummer)|John Stevens]]. In 2010 a 2CD Deluxe version of Live at Leeds was released, and it was discovered that not all of the songs on the original album were from the Leeds concert. After releasing ''Live at Leeds'', Martyn took a sabbatical, including a visit to [[Jamaica]], spending time with reggae producer [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]].\n\nIn 1977, he released ''[[One World (John Martyn album)|One World]]'', which led some commentators to describe Martyn as the \"Father of [[Trip-Hop]]\".<ref>His obituary in ''The Times'' states that \"The record's dubby, echoing soundscapes have been claimed as the forerunner of the 'trip-hop' style that emerged in the 1990s.\"</ref> It included tracks such as \"Small Hours\" and \"Big Muff\", a collaboration with Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. ''Small Hours'' was recorded outside; the microphones picked up ambient sounds, such as geese from a nearby lake.<ref name=\"munro\" /> In 1978 he played guitar on the album ''Harmony of the Spheres'' by [[Neil Ardley]].\n\n==1980s and marriage breakup==\nMartyn's marriage broke down at the end of the 1970s and \"John hit the self destruct button\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} (although other biographers, including ''The Times'' obituary writer, attribute the break-up of his marriage to his already being addicted to drink and drugs).<ref name=\"timesobit\"/> In her autobiography, Beverley also alleges protracted domestic violence.<ref name=\"honesty\">Beverley Martyn, Jacki Dacosta, ''Sweet Honesty - The Beverley Martyn Story''; {{ISBN|978-1-90721-188-1}}, Grosvenor, 2011</ref>  Out of this period, described by Martyn as \"a very dark period in my life\",<ref name=\"bio1980\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmartyn.com/?location=/web/1980s|title='&#39;John's Diary 1980s'&#39; \u2014 Martyn's biography on his website|publisher=Johnmartyn.com|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> came the album ''[[Grace and Danger]]''. Released in October 1980, the album had been held up for a year by Chris Blackwell. He was a close friend of John and Beverley, and found the album too openly disturbing to release. Only after intense and sustained pressure from Martyn did Blackwell agree to release the album. Commenting on that period, Martyn said, \"I was in a dreadful emotional state over that record. I was hardly in control of my own actions. The reason they finally released it was because I freaked: Please get it out! I don't give a damn about how sad it makes you feel\u2014it's what I'm about: the direct communication of emotion. ''Grace and Danger'' was very cathartic, and it really hurt.\"<ref name=\"bio1980\"/>\n\nIn the late 1980s Martyn cited ''Grace and Danger'' as his favourite album, and said that it was \"probably the most specific piece of autobiography I've written. Some people keep diaries, I make records.\"<ref name=\"bio1980\"/> The album has since become one of his highest-regarded, prompting a deluxe double-disc issue in 2007, containing the original album remastered.\n\n[[Phil Collins]] played drums and sang backing vocals on ''Grace and Danger'' and subsequently played drums on and produced Martyn's next album, ''[[Glorious Fool]]'', in 1981. Martyn left Island records in 1981, and recorded ''Glorious Fool'' and ''[[Well Kept Secret]]'' for [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] achieving his first Top 30 album.<ref name=\"timesobit\"/> Martyn released a live album, ''[[Philentropy]]'', in 1983. Returning to Island records, he recorded ''[[Sapphire (John Martyn album)|Sapphire]]'' (1984), ''[[Piece by Piece (John Martyn album)|Piece by Piece]]'' (1986) and the live ''[[Foundations (album)|Foundations]]'' (1987) before leaving the label in 1988.\n\n==1990s and 2000s==\n[[File:John-Martyn-at-the-Barbican-Centre.JPG|thumb|upright|John Martyn performs at the [[Barbican Centre]], London 2008.]]\nMartyn released ''[[The Apprentice (album)|The Apprentice]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Cooltide]]'' in 1991 for Permanent Records, and reunited with Phil Collins for ''[[No Little Boy]]'' (1993) which featured rerecorded versions of some of his classic tracks. The similar 1992 release ''[[Couldn't Love You More]]'' was unauthorised by and disowned by Martyn. Material from these recordings and his two Permanent albums has been recycled on many releases. Permanent Records also released a live 2-CD set called \"Live\" in 1994. ''And'' (1996) came out on Go!Discs and saw Martyn draw heavily on trip-hop textures, a direction which saw more complete expression on 2000s ''[[Glasgow Walker]]''; ''[[The Church with One Bell]]'' (1998) is a covers album which draws on songs by [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] and [[Ben Harper]].

By the 1970s he had begun incorporating [[jazz]] and [[rock music|rock]] into his sound on albums such as ''[[Solid Air]]'' (1973) and ''[[One World (John Martyn album)|One World]]'' (1977), as well as experimenting with [[guitar effects]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] machines such as [[Echoplex]].<ref name=\"all\">{{cite web|last1=Hartenbach|first1=Brett|title=John Martyn: Biography & History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-martyn-mn0000196969/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> He struggled with substance abuse and domestic problems throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though continued to release albums while collaborating with figures such as [[Phil Collins]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]].

By 1970 Martyn had developed a wholly original and idiosyncratic sound: acoustic guitar run through a [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]], phase shifter and [[Echoplex]]. This sound was first apparent on ''[[Stormbringer! (John and Beverley Martyn album)|Stormbringer!]]'' in 1970, which was written and performed by Martyn and his then-wife Beverley, who had previously recorded solo as [[Beverley Martyn|Beverley Kutner]]. Her second album with Martyn was ''[[The Road to Ruin (John and Beverley Martyn album)|The Road to Ruin]]'', also released in 1970. Island Records felt that it would be more successful to market Martyn as a solo act and this was how subsequent albums were produced, although Beverley continued to make appearances as a backing singer as well as continuing as a solo artist herself.<ref name=\"timesobit\"/>\n\n==1970s==\n{{listen\n| filename     = John Martyn Eibhli.ogg\n| title        = \"Eibhli Ghail Chiuin Ni Chearbhail\"\n| description  = \"Eibhli Ghail Chiuin Ni Chearbhail\" (1973), built around a traditional tune, was featured on ''Inside Out''.

In 2009, a double CD Deluxe edition of ''Solid Air'' was released featuring unreleased songs and out-takes, and sleeve notes by Record Collector's Daryl Easlea. On ''Solid Air'', as with the one that preceded it, ''[[Bless the Weather]]'', Martyn collaborated with [[jazz]] bassist [[Danny Thompson]], with whom he proceeded to have a musical partnership which continued until his death. \n\nFollowing the commercial success of ''Solid Air'', Martyn quickly recorded and released the experimental ''[[Inside Out (John Martyn album)|Inside Out]]'', an album with emphasis placed on feel and improvisation rather than song structure. In 1975, he followed this with ''[[Sunday's Child]]'', a more song-based collection \"My Baby Girl\", \"Spencer the Rover\", with several references to his young family. Martyn subsequently described this period as 'very happy'. In September 1975 he released a live album, ''[[Live at Leeds (John Martyn album)|Live at Leeds]]'' \u2014 Martyn had been unable to persuade Island to release the record, and resorted to selling individually signed copies by mail from home. ''Live at Leeds'' features Danny Thompson and drummer [[John Stevens (drummer)|John Stevens]]. In 2010 a 2CD Deluxe version of Live at Leeds was released, and it was discovered that not all of the songs on the original album were from the Leeds concert. After releasing ''Live at Leeds'', Martyn took a sabbatical, including a visit to [[Jamaica]], spending time with reggae producer [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]].\n\nIn 1977, he released ''[[One World (John Martyn album)|One World]]'', which led some commentators to describe Martyn as the \"Father of [[Trip-Hop]]\".<ref>His obituary in ''The Times'' states that \"The record's dubby, echoing soundscapes have been claimed as the forerunner of the 'trip-hop' style that emerged in the 1990s.\"</ref> It included tracks such as \"Small Hours\" and \"Big Muff\", a collaboration with Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. ''Small Hours'' was recorded outside; the microphones picked up ambient sounds, such as geese from a nearby lake.<ref name=\"munro\" /> In 1978 he played guitar on the album ''Harmony of the Spheres'' by [[Neil Ardley]].\n\n==1980s and marriage breakup==\nMartyn's marriage broke down at the end of the 1970s and \"John hit the self destruct button\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} (although other biographers, including ''The Times'' obituary writer, attribute the break-up of his marriage to his already being addicted to drink and drugs).<ref name=\"timesobit\"/> In her autobiography, Beverley also alleges protracted domestic violence.<ref name=\"honesty\">Beverley Martyn, Jacki Dacosta, ''Sweet Honesty - The Beverley Martyn Story''; {{ISBN|978-1-90721-188-1}}, Grosvenor, 2011</ref>  Out of this period, described by Martyn as \"a very dark period in my life\",<ref name=\"bio1980\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmartyn.com/?location=/web/1980s|title='&#39;John's Diary 1980s'&#39; \u2014 Martyn's biography on his website|publisher=Johnmartyn.com|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> came the album ''[[Grace and Danger]]''. Released in October 1980, the album had been held up for a year by Chris Blackwell. He was a close friend of John and Beverley, and found the album too openly disturbing to release. Only after intense and sustained pressure from Martyn did Blackwell agree to release the album. Commenting on that period, Martyn said, \"I was in a dreadful emotional state over that record. I was hardly in control of my own actions. The reason they finally released it was because I freaked: Please get it out! I don't give a damn about how sad it makes you feel\u2014it's what I'm about: the direct communication of emotion. ''Grace and Danger'' was very cathartic, and it really hurt.\"<ref name=\"bio1980\"/>\n\nIn the late 1980s Martyn cited ''Grace and Danger'' as his favourite album, and said that it was \"probably the most specific piece of autobiography I've written. Some people keep diaries, I make records.\"<ref name=\"bio1980\"/> The album has since become one of his highest-regarded, prompting a deluxe double-disc issue in 2007, containing the original album remastered.\n\n[[Phil Collins]] played drums and sang backing vocals on ''Grace and Danger'' and subsequently played drums on and produced Martyn's next album, ''[[Glorious Fool]]'', in 1981. Martyn left Island records in 1981, and recorded ''Glorious Fool'' and ''[[Well Kept Secret]]'' for [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] achieving his first Top 30 album.<ref name=\"timesobit\"/> Martyn released a live album, ''[[Philentropy]]'', in 1983. Returning to Island records, he recorded ''[[Sapphire (John Martyn album)|Sapphire]]'' (1984), ''[[Piece by Piece (John Martyn album)|Piece by Piece]]'' (1986) and the live ''[[Foundations (album)|Foundations]]'' (1987) before leaving the label in 1988.\n\n==1990s and 2000s==\n[[File:John-Martyn-at-the-Barbican-Centre.JPG|thumb|upright|John Martyn performs at the [[Barbican Centre]], London 2008.]]\nMartyn released ''[[The Apprentice (album)|The Apprentice]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Cooltide]]'' in 1991 for Permanent Records, and reunited with Phil Collins for ''[[No Little Boy]]'' (1993) which featured rerecorded versions of some of his classic tracks. The similar 1992 release ''[[Couldn't Love You More]]'' was unauthorised by and disowned by Martyn. Material from these recordings and his two Permanent albums has been recycled on many releases. Permanent Records also released a live 2-CD set called \"Live\" in 1994. ''And'' (1996) came out on Go!Discs and saw Martyn draw heavily on trip-hop textures, a direction which saw more complete expression on 2000s ''[[Glasgow Walker]]''; ''[[The Church with One Bell]]'' (1998) is a covers album which draws on songs by [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] and [[Ben Harper]].

Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be \"modelling\".\n\nTypes of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional, and commercial print models. Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television. Fashion models are sometimes featured in films (''[[Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter (film)|Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter]]'' and ''[[Looker]]''); [[Reality television|reality TV]] shows (''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' and ''[[The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency]]''); and music videos (\"[[Freedom!

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was [[Jinx Falkenburg]] who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time; <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401102507/http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-04-01 |title=fashion models 1940s, fashion modeling in 1940, Forties Fashion modeling agencies, first fashion modeling agency in New York, 1940s fashion models, John Powers modeling agency, girls of the John Roberts Powers modeling agency, Powers Girls Photographs, popular 1 |publisher=Oldmagazinearticles.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> through the 1950s, [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], [[Jean Patchett]], [[Dovima]], [[Dorian Leigh]], [[Suzy Parker]], [[Evelyn Tripp]], and [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]] also dominated fashion.<ref>{{cite newspaper |author=Cathy Horyn|date=4 February 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |title=Jean Patchett, 75, a Model Who Helped Define the 50s |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=19 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829054807/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |archive-date=29 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Dorothea Church]] was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned \u00a380 an hour, while the average wage was \u00a315 a week.[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965|298x298px]]In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]]. By 1968, FM Agency and [[Models&nbsp;1]] were established and represented models in a similar way that agencies do today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=23 |title=Europe's Leading Model Agency |publisher=Models 1 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020130053/http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=23 |archivedate=2012-10-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmmodelagency.com/contact.aspx?nav=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928133313/http://www.fmmodelagency.com/contact.aspx?nav=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-09-28 |title=FM Agency \u2013 London \u2013 Contact |publisher=Fmmodelagency.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> By the late 1960s, models were treated better and were making better wages.

In 1981, cosmetics companies began contracting top models to lucrative [[Testimonial|endorsement deals]]. By 1983, Elite developed its own contest titled the Elite Model Look competition. In New York during the 1980s there were so-called \"model wars\" in which the Ford and Elite agencies fought over models and campaigns.

[[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.<ref name=\"um\">''Death of the Supermodels'' by C. L.

Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., [[stock photography]] and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Some plus-size models have appeared in runway shows and campaigns for mainstream retailers and designers such as Gucci, Guess, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Levi's and Versace Jeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |title=Q&A: Paul Marciano on 30 Years of Guess Campaigns |author=Tran, Khan T.L. |date=1 May 2012 |work=wwd.com |publisher=Women's Wear Daily |accessdate=12 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706050948/http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |archive-date=2012-07-06 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |title=Fashion's new Dahling; All Woman: Sophie Makes A Comeback with Three New Contracts and a Sexy, Slimmer Look. |author=Brown, Annie |date=3 July 2000 |newspaper=The Daily Record |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124720/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |archive-date=2013-10-19 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Serpe, Gina\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |title=Anna Nicole Smith's Death Five Years On: Timeline of a Tragedy |author=Serpe, Gina |date=8 February 2012 |work=people.com |publisher=People Magazine |accessdate=13 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012182511/http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |archive-date=2012-10-12 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |title=Levi's Boyfriend Collection F/W 10 |work=models.com |accessdate=20 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513085352/http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== Normal-size ====\n[[File:Camille_Kostek_in_New_York,_July_2017_1.png|alt=|left|thumb|196x196px|[[Camille Kostek]] is a normal-size or \"middle model\" at size 4/6]]\nAlso known as the \"in-between\" and \"middle models\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/not-middle-sized-models-fashion/|title=Why aren't there more 'middle' sized models in fashion?|last=Holt|first=Bethan|date=2018-11-10|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> they are neither considered catalogue size (0\u20132) nor plus-size (10 up).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brit.co/why-middle-models-left-out-of-traditional-fashion-industry/|title=Why the Average American Woman Is Being Left Out of the Traditional Fashion Industry|website=Brit + Co|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15|date=2018-05-30}}</ref> Actress [[Mindy Kaling]] has described this body type in her 2011 book ''Is Everybody Hanging out With Me'' writing, \"Since I am not model-skinny, but also not super-fat...

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new \u201cNegro Market\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haidarali|first=Laila|date=2005|title=Polishing Brown Diamonds: African American Women, Popular Magazines, and the Advent of Modeling in Early Postwar America|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10\u201337|doi=10.1353/jowh.2005.0007|issn=1527-2036}}</ref> With the help of Branford Models, the first African American agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modeling era. Branford Models\u2019 was able to \u201coverturn the barriers facing African American in the early postwar period\u201d especially by lifting at least one economic freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced \u201cas a stage for models to display consumer goods\u201d while assisting \u201cin constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modeling world. Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial in-equality, the United States recognized the urgency of opening the \u201cdoors of social access and visibility to black Americans\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2143|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Works}}</ref> The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. \u201cThe world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing too. [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] in October 1969, covered their issue with [[Naomi Sims|Noami Sims]], one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame lead her to international magazine jobs and individual projects with designers across the globe.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/naomi-campbell-famous-black-models|title=Naomi Campbell and 10 Black Models Who Owned the Runway|last=Haynes|first=Clarence|date=June 24, 2019|website=Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models.

In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Many famous AV idols started out as gravure idols.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tokyokinky.com/akb48-idols-nude-models-porn-careers/ |title = Former AKB48 idols who have \"graduated\" to porn careers |website=Tokyo Kinky |author=Tadashi Anahori |date=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial print and on-camera models===\nCommercial print models generally appear in print ads for non-fashion products, and in television commercials. Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their [[engagement marketing]] strategy.

Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned \u00a380 an hour, while the average wage was \u00a315 a week.[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965|298x298px]]In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

[[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.<ref name=\"um\">''Death of the Supermodels'' by C. L.

Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on site; models under sixteen must be accompanied by an adult chaperone; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the [[child model]]'s gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Darwell|first=Robert A.|author2=Theodore C.

Second-tier international fashion center cities include [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Brescia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Moscow]].\n\nThe criteria for runway models include certain height and weight requirements. During runway shows, models have to constantly change clothes and makeup. Models walk, turn, and stand in order to demonstrate a garment's key features.

Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new \u201cNegro Market\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haidarali|first=Laila|date=2005|title=Polishing Brown Diamonds: African American Women, Popular Magazines, and the Advent of Modeling in Early Postwar America|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10\u201337|doi=10.1353/jowh.2005.0007|issn=1527-2036}}</ref> With the help of Branford Models, the first African American agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modeling era. Branford Models\u2019 was able to \u201coverturn the barriers facing African American in the early postwar period\u201d especially by lifting at least one economic freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced \u201cas a stage for models to display consumer goods\u201d while assisting \u201cin constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modeling world. Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial in-equality, the United States recognized the urgency of opening the \u201cdoors of social access and visibility to black Americans\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2143|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Works}}</ref> The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. \u201cThe world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing too. [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] in October 1969, covered their issue with [[Naomi Sims|Noami Sims]], one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame lead her to international magazine jobs and individual projects with designers across the globe.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/naomi-campbell-famous-black-models|title=Naomi Campbell and 10 Black Models Who Owned the Runway|last=Haynes|first=Clarence|date=June 24, 2019|website=Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models.

In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Many famous AV idols started out as gravure idols.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tokyokinky.com/akb48-idols-nude-models-porn-careers/ |title = Former AKB48 idols who have \"graduated\" to porn careers |website=Tokyo Kinky |author=Tadashi Anahori |date=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial print and on-camera models===\nCommercial print models generally appear in print ads for non-fashion products, and in television commercials. Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their [[engagement marketing]] strategy.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four [[gonads]], visible through its [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] body. This radial symmetry is [[ecology | ecologically]] important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (mainly food and danger) from all directions.\n\n[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|Apple cut horizontally showing that pentamerism also occurs in fruit]]\n\n[[Flowering plant]]s show five-fold symmetry, or pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits.

Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry.

These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.\n\n== Icosahedral symmetry ==\n[[File:Gastroenteritis viruses.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|[[Gastroenteritis]] viruses have icosahedral symmetry]]\nIcosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an [[equilateral triangle]], and 12 corners. Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural [[protein|proteins]] (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60. For example, the T=3 ''[[Tomato bushy stunt virus]]'' has 60x3 protein subunits (180 copies of the same structural protein).<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Alan J Cann|title=Virus Structure|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2 |year=2015 |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url= | title=Symmetry in virus architecture |author1=Horne, R.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there.

Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]].

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref> For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry| facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness.

''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]].

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry.

Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural [[protein|proteins]] (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]].

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there.

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref> For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape. It is believed that the evolution of specialized pollinators may play a part in the transition of radially symmetrical flowers to bilaterally symmetrical flowers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hileman |first1=Lena C |last2=Cubas |first2=Pilar |title=An expanded evolutionary role for flower symmetry genes |journal=Journal of Biology |date=2009 |volume=8 |pages=90 |doi=10.1186/jbiol193}}</ref>\n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in animals ===\nSymmetry is often selected for in the evolution of animals. This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry| facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] (sponges) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

For example the direction of helical growth in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', the most commonly studied model plant, shows left-handedness. Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Nortes |first1=Tamara |last2=Wilson-S\u00e1nchez |first2=David |last3=Candela |first3=H\u00e9ctor |last4=Micol |first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis |title=Symmetry, asymmetry, and the cell cycle in plants: known knowns and some known unknowns |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2014 |volume=65 |pages=2645\u20132655 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert476}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===Biological structures===\n* [[Standard anatomical position]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of motion]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of muscle]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of bone]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]] \n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]] \n* [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]\n* [[Glossary of entomology terms]]\n* [[Plant morphology]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* [[Handedness]]\n* [[Laterality]]\n* [[Proper right and proper left]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n* [[Sinistral and dextral]]\n* [[Direction (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]] (2009).

It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry. Gangtok is a city of great food, atmosphere sceneries and beautiful buddhist monastery which in includes rumtek and enchey monastery.\n\nrumtek and enchey are the most famous and know monastery.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital. The current Chief minister is Prem Singh Golay. \n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time. \n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for liited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011).

the capital and the largest town of the [[India]]n state of [[Sikkim]]. It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time.\n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2</ref>\n\nIn 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum.<!---Nest&Wings pg-21-24|NaW---> Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.<ref name=\"chap4\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| align    = left\n| title = [[Kangchenjunga]]\n| image1 = Kangch-Goechala.jpg\n| image2 = Kangchenjunga East Face from Zemu Glacier.jpg\n| footer   = <center>[[Kangchenjunga]], visible from Gangtok, the third [[List of highest mountains|highest mountain in the world]], near the [[Zemu Glacier]].</center> \n}}\nGangtok is located at {{Coord|27.3325|N|88.6140|E|}} (coordinates of Gangtok head post office).<ref name=\"FallinGrain\" /> It is situated in the lower [[Himalaya]]s at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"metgang\" /> The town lies on one side of a hill, with \"The Ridge\",<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /><ref name=\"discoveringbook\" /> a promenade housing the [[Raj Bhavan (Sikkim)|Raj Bhawan]], the [[governor]]'s residence, at one end and the palace, situated at an altitude of about {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, at the other. The city is flanked on east and west by two streams, namely [[Roro Chu]] and [[Ranikhola]], respectively.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, the eastern and western parts. Both the streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] at [[Singtam]].<ref name=\"chap4\" /> Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.<ref name=\"mapsindiagang\" />\n\n[[File:Ban Jhakri Falls - Gangtok.jpg|thumb|right|Banjhakri Falls - Gangtok]]\nMost of [[Sikkim]], including Gangtok, is underlain by [[Precambrian]] rocks which contains [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] [[phyllite]]s and [[schists]]; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> Surface runoff of water by natural streams (''jhora'') and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]] (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] (8,598&nbsp;m or 28,208&nbsp;ft)\u2014the world's third-highest peak\u2014is visible to the west of the city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.<ref name=\"chap4\" />\n\nThere are densely forested regions around Gangtok, consisting of temperate, [[deciduous]] forests of [[Populus|poplar]], [[birch]], [[oak]], and [[elm]], as well as [[evergreen]], [[coniferous]] trees of the [[alpine climate|wet alpine]] zone.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> [[Orchids]] are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. [[Bamboo]]s are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and [[subtropical]].<ref name=\"chap2\" /> Flowers such as [[sunflower]], [[Tagetes|marigold]], [[poinsettia]], and others bloom, especially in November and December.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Gangtok weatherbox}}\n\nGangtok features a monsoon-influenced [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cwb''). Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, [[temperate]] climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]]s, autumn, winter, and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of {{convert|22|C|F|lk=on|abbr=on|0}} in summer to an average minimum of {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} in winter.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> Summers (lasting from late April to June) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}}. The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-[[monsoon]] in May, and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of {{convert|649.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> In winter temperature averages between {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> [[Snowfall]] is rare, and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005<ref name=\"chap2\" /> and 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gangtok sees snowfall after 15 years \u00bb Northeast Today |url=https://www.northeasttoday.in/gangtok-sees-snowfall-after-15-years/ |accessdate=9 January 2020 |work=Northeast Today |date=7 January 2020}}</ref> Temperatures below [[freezing point|freezing]] are also rare.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> During this season the weather can be unstable, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours.
