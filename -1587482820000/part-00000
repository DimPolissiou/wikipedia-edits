The container mentioned in the original story was actually a large storage jar but the word was later mistranslated as \"box\". It was mistranslated because people aren't smart enough and they don't have big brains.\n\n==In mythology==\n{{main|Pandora}}\nAccording to Hesiod, when [[Prometheus]] stole fire from heaven, [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, took vengeance by presenting Pandora to Prometheus' brother [[Epimetheus]]. Pandora opened a jar left in her care containing sickness, death and many other unspecified evils which were then released into the world.<ref>Cf. Hesiod, ''[[Works and Days]]'', (90). \"For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote and free from ills and hard toil and heavy sicknesses which bring the Fates upon men ... Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and the sea is full. Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took away speech from them.\"</ref>  Though she hastened to close the container, only one thing was left behind \u2013 usually translated as [[Elpis|Hope]], though it could also have the pessimistic meaning of \"deceptive expectation\".<ref>''Brill's Companion to Hesiod'', Leiden NL 2009, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R4MtDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA77&ots=7laQtz7z8i&dq=%22pandora%22%20%20hope%20means%20deceptive%20expectations&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q=%22pandora%22%20%20hope%20means%20deceptive%20expectations&f=false p.77]</ref>\n\nFrom this story has grown the idiom \"to open a Pandora's box\", meaning to do or start something that will cause many unforeseen problems.<ref>[https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/open-a-pandora-s-box ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'']</ref> Its modern, more colloquial equivalent is \"to open a [[wikt:can of worms|can of worms]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l_LxuR1jMVgC&pg=PA52&dq=%22Pandora%27s+box%22+idiom&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtlLOngt3YAhVECMAKHVp6DfMQ6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=%22Pandora%27s%20box%22%20idiom&f=false ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms'', 2013]</ref>\n[[File:Wedding procession pyxis BM GR1920.12-21.1 by Marley Painter.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An Attic ''[[Pyxis (pottery)|pyxis]]'', 440\u2013430 BC. British Museum|alt=]]\n\n==Etymology of the \"box\"==\n\nThe word translated as \"box\" was actually a large jar (\u03c0\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ''pithos'') in Greek.<ref>Schlegel and Weinfield, \"Introduction to Hesiod\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=R6GqYRhaCCAC&pg=PA6 p. 6]</ref><ref>Meagher 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vBDfKCyC2LMC&pg=PA148 p. 148]</ref> It was used for storage of wine, oil, grain or other provisions, or, ritually, as a container for a human body for burying, from which it was believed souls escaped and necessarily returned.<ref>Cf. Harrison, Jane Ellen, ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek history'', Chapter II, \"The Pithoigia\", pp.42-43. Cf. also Figure 7 which shows an ancient Greek pot painting in the University of Jena where Hermes is presiding over a body in a pithos buried in the ground. \"In the vase painting in fig.7 from a lekythos in the University Museum of Jena we see a Pithoigia of quite other and solemn booty. A large pithos is sunk deep into the ground. It has served as a grave. ... The vase-painting in fig. 7 must not be regarded as an actual conscious representation of the rupent rite performed on the first day of the Anthesteria. It is more general in content; it is in fact simply a representation of ideas familiar to every Greek, that the pithos was a grave-jar, that from such grave-jars souls escaped and to them necessarily returned, and that Hermes was ''Psychopompos'', Evoker and Revoker of souls. The vase-painting is in fact only another form of the scene so often represented on Athenian white ''lekythoi'', in which the souls flutter round the grave-stele. The grave-jar is but the earlier form of sepulture; the little winged figures, the Keres, are identical in both classes of vase-painting.\"</ref> Many scholars see a close analogy between Pandora herself, who was made from clay, and the clay jar which dispenses evils.<ref>Cf. Jenifer Neils 2005, p.41 especially: \"They ignore, however, Hesiod's description of Pandora's ''pithos'' as ''arrektoisi'' or unbreakable. This adjective, which is usually applied to objects of metal, such as gold fetters and hobbles in Homer (''Il. 13.37, 15.20''), would strongly imply that the jar is made of metal rather than earthenware, which is obviously capable of being broken.\"</ref>\n\nThe mistranslation of ''pithos'' is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist [[Erasmus]] who, in his Latin account of the story of Pandora, changed the Greek ''pithos'' to ''[[Pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]]'', meaning \"box\".<ref>Meagher 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vBDfKCyC2LMC&pg=PA56 p. 56]. In his notes to Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' (p.168) M.L. West has surmised that Erasmus may have confused the story of Pandora with that found elsewhere of a box which was opened by [[Eros and Psyche|Psyche]].</ref> The context in which the story appeared was Erasmus' collection of proverbs, the ''[[Adagia]]'' (1508), in illustration of the Latin saying ''Malo accepto stultus sapit'' (from experiencing trouble a fool is made wise). In his version the box is opened by [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]], whose name means 'Afterthought' \u2013 or as Hesiod comments, \"he whom mistakes made wise\".<ref>William Watson Baker, ''The Adages of Erasmus'', University of Toronto 2001, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VmJn6IFMyicC&lpg=PA382&vq=Malo%20accepto&pg=PA32#v=snippet&q=Malo%20accepto&f=false 1 i 31, p.32]</ref>  \n\n===Different versions of the container===\n<gallery>\nFile:Pandora (Louvre, RF 2016-4).jpg|Nicol\u00f2 dell'Abate, 1555\nFile:\"\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430\" 1801\u0433. \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e \u21162.jpg|Russian fountain, 1801 \nFile:Pandora opening her box by James Gillray.jpg|James Gillray cartoon, 1809\nFile:John Gibson-Pandora-Victoria and Albert Museum-2.jpg|John Gibson statue, 1899\nFile:Pandora - John William Waterhouse.jpg|John William Waterhouse, 1896 \n</gallery>\n\n{{Commons Category|Pandora}}\n<br />\n<br />\n\n==Contents==\nThere were alternative accounts of jars or urns containing blessings and evils bestowed upon humanity in Greek myth, of which a very early account is related in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'':\n<blockquote>On the floor of Jove's palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.<ref>Iliad, [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.24.xxiv.html 24:527ff]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a major departure from Hesiod, the 6th-century BC Greek [[elegiac]] poet [[Theognis of Megara]] states that \n<blockquote><poem>\nHope is the only good god remaining among mankind;\nthe others have left and gone to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].\nTrust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men,\nand the [[Graces]], my friend, have abandoned the earth.\nMen's judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone\nrevere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and\nmen no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety.<ref>Theognis, 1135ff.</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Epimetheus opening Pandora's box MET DP812748.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Giulio Bonasone]]\u2019s 16th century engraving of Epimetheus opening the fatal jar]]\nThe poem seems to hint at a myth in which the jar contained blessings rather than evils. It is confirmed in the new era by an [[Aesop\u2019s Fables|Aesopic]] fable recorded by [[Babrius]], in which the gods send the jar containing blessings to humans. Rather than a named female, it was a generic \"foolish man\" (\u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) who opened the jar out of curiosity and let them escape. Once the lid was replaced, only hope remained, \"promising that she will bestow on each of us the good things that have gone away.\" This [[Aetiology|aetiological]] version is numbered 312 in the [[Perry Index]].<ref>[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/312.htm Aesopica]</ref>  \n\nIn the Renaissance, the story of the jar was revisited by two immensely influential writers, [[Andrea Alciato]] in his [[Emblem book|''Emblemata'']] (1534) and the [[Neo-Latin]] poet [[Gabriele Faerno]] in his collection of a hundred fables (''Fabulum Centum'', 1563). Alciato only alluded to the story while depicting the goddess Hope seated on a jar in which, she declares, \"I alone stayed behind at home when evils fluttered all around, as the revered muse of the old poet [Hesiod] has told you\".<ref>[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/alciato/emblem.php?id=A50a044 ''In simulachrum spei'']</ref> Faerno\u2019s short poem also addressed the origin of hope but in this case it is the remainder of the \"universal blessings\" (''bona universa'') that have escaped: \"Of all good things that mortals lack,/Hope in the soul alone stays back.\"<ref>''Fabulum Centum'', London 1743, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wlATAAAAQAAJ&q=Spes#v=snippet&q=Spes&f=false Fable 94, p.216]</ref> \n\nAn idea of the nature of the blessings lost is given in a Renaissance [[engraving]] by [[Giulio Bonasone]], where the culprit is Pandora\u2019s husband, [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. He is shown holding the lid of a large storage jar from which female representations of the Roman virtues are flying up into the air. They are identified by their names in Latin: security ([[salus]]), harmony ([[Concordia (mythology)|concordia]]), fairness ([[aequitas]]), mercy ([[clementia]]), freedom ([[libertas]]), happiness ([[felicitas]]), peace ([[Pax (goddess)|pax]]), worth ([[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]) and joy ([[Laetitia_(goddess)|laetitia]]). Hope ([[spes]]) is delayed on the lip and holds aloft the flower that is her attribute.<ref>[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/392735 Metropolitan Museum]</ref>\n\n==Difficulties of interpretation==\nIn Hesiodic scholarship, the interpretive [[crux (literary)|crux]] has endured:<ref> Though Pandora was not a subject of medieval art, Dora Panofsky and Erwin Panofsky examined the post-Renaissance ''mythos'', see Bibliography</ref> Is the hope imprisoned within a jar full of evils to be considered a benefit for humanity, or a further curse? A number of mythology textbooks echo the sentiments of M. L. West: \"[Hope's retention in the jar] is comforting, and we are to be thankful for this antidote to our present ills.\"<ref>West 1978, p. 169.</ref> Some scholars such as Mark Griffith, however, take the opposite view: \"[Hope] seems to be a blessing withheld from men so that their life should be the more dreary and depressing.\"<ref>Griffith 1983:250.</ref> One's interpretation hangs on two related questions: First, how are we to render ''[[elpis]]'', the Greek word usually translated as \"hope\"? Second, does the jar preserve ''Elpis'' for men, or keep ''Elpis'' away from men?\n\nAs with most ancient Greek words, ''elpis'' can be translated a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of \"expectation.\" Classical authors use the word ''elpis'' to mean \"expectation of bad,\" as well as \"expectation of good.\" Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of extant ancient Greek literature.<ref>Leinieks 1984, 1\u20134.</ref> Others hold the minority view that ''elpis'' should be rendered, \"expectation of evil\" (''vel sim'').<ref name=\"Verdenius1985\">E.g., Verdenius 1985; Blumer 2001.</ref>\n\nHow one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a [[pantry]]?<ref>The prison/pantry terminology comes from Verdenius 1985 ad 96.</ref> The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released \u2013 they only affect humanity once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for ''Elpis'' as well, withholding it from the human race.<ref>Scholars holding this view (e.g., Walcot 1961, 250) point out that the jar is termed an \"unbreakable\" (in Greek: ''arrektos'') house. In Greek literature (e.g., Homer, and elsewhere in Hesiod), the word ''arrektos'' is applied to structures meant to sequester or otherwise restrain its contents.</ref> If one takes ''elpis'' to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.<ref>See Griffith 1984 above.</ref> A less pessimistic interpretation understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but each of us is hopelessly human.<ref>Thus [[Apostolos Athanassakis|Athanassakis]] 1983 in his commentary ad ''Works'' 96.</ref>\n\nIt is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for humanity, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes humanity lazy by taking away their industriousness, making them prone to evil.<ref>Cf. Jenifer Neils, in ''The Girl in the Pithos: Hesiod's Elpis'', in [https://books.google.com/books?id=6yi6XtAI6GwC&printsec=frontcover \"Periklean Athens and its Legacy. Problems and Perspectives\"], pp.&nbsp;40\u201341 especially.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that \"Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\"<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''Human, All Too Human''. Cf. Section Two, On the History of Moral Feelings, aph. 71. \"Hope. Pandora brought the jar with the evils and opened it. It was the gods' gift to man, on the outside a beautiful, enticing gift, called the 'lucky jar.' Then all the evils, those lively, winged beings, flew out of it. Since that time, they roam around and do harm to men by day and night. One single evil had not yet slipped out of the jar. As Zeus had wished, Pandora slammed the top down and it remained inside. So now man has the lucky jar in his house forever and thinks the world of the treasure. It is at his service; he reaches for it when he fancies it. For he does not know that the jar which Pandora brought was the jar of evils, and he takes the remaining evil for the greatest worldly good\u2014it is hope, for Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\"</ref>\n\nAn objection to the ''hope is good/the jar is a prison'' interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope \u2013 a blessing \u2013 doing among them? This objection leads some to render ''elpis'' as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although mankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable.<ref name=\"Verdenius1985\" />\n\nThe optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. ''Elpis'' takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, \"It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one.\"<ref>West 1978, 169\u201370.</ref> Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.<ref>Taking the jar to serve as a prison at some times and as a pantry at others will also accommodate another pessimistic interpretation of the myth. In this reading, attention is paid to the phrase ''moune Elpis'' \u2013 \"only Hope,\" or \"Hope alone.\" A minority opinion construes the phrase instead to mean \"empty Hope\" or \"baseless Hope\": not only are humans plagued by a multitude of evils, but they persist in the fruitless hope that things might get better. Thus Beall 1989 227\u201328.</ref>\n\n==Fixing the blame==\nNeither Alciato nor Faerno had named who was responsible for opening the jar beyond saying it was a \"mortal\". During the Renaissance it is the name of Epimetheus that is mentioned as often as not, as in the engraving by Bonasone noticed above and the mention of Pandora's partner in a [[rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]] that [[Isaac de Benserade]] took it on himself to insert into his light-hearted version of the [[Metamorphoses]] (1676) - although [[Ovid]] had not in fact written about it himself.\n[[File:S\u00e9bastien Le Clerc - Pandora and Epimetheus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Pandora seated with her husband Epimetheus, who has just opened her jar of curses; an etching by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Clerc]] (1676)]]\n\n<blockquote><poem>::In a jar an odious treasure is\n::Shut by the gods\u2019 wish:\n::A gift that\u2019s not everyday,\n::The owner\u2019s Pandora alone; \n::And her eyes, this in hand,\n::Command the best in the land \n::As she flits near and far; \n::Prettiness can\u2019t stay\n::Shut in a jar.\n::Someone took her eye, he took\n::A look at what pleased her so\n::And out came the grief and woe\n::We won\u2018t ever be rid of,\n::For heaven had hidden\n::That in the jar.</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe etching by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Clerc]] that accompanied the poem in the book shows Pandora and Epimetheus seated on either side of a jar from which clouds of smoke emerge, carrying up the escaping evils. The lid of the jar is quite plainly in Epimetheus\u2019 hand.<ref>Panofsky 1956, [https://www.scribd.com/document/365690708/Pandoras-Box-The-Changing-Aspects-of-a-Mythical-Symbol-by-Dora-and-Erwin-Panofsky-Art-eBook p.79]</ref> [[Paolo Farinati]], an earlier Venetian artist, was also responsible for a print which laid the blame on Epimetheus, depicting him as lifting the lid from the jar that Pandora is holding. Out of it boils a cloud which carries up a man and a dragon; between them they support a scroll reading \"''sero nimirum sapere caepit''\" (finding out too late), in reference to the meaning of Epimetheus' name in Greek\n.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.or/wiki/File:Pandora%27s_gift_to_Epimetheus.jpg Wikimedia]</ref>\n\n[[File:Pandora allegory 1557.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|An Allegory of ''Les Sciences qui \u00c9clairent l'esprit de l'homme'' (The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit, 1557), an etching ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro]]\nAnother Venetian print, ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro (active 1565 \u2013 1586), is much more enigmatic. Usually titled \"Pandora's Box, or The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit\", it portrays a woman in antique dress opening an ornate coffer from which spill books, manuscripts, snakes and bats. By Pandora's side is a woman carrying a burning brand, while a horned figure flees in the opposite direction. Above is a curved vault painted with signs of the zodiac to which the sun-god [[Apollo]] is pointing, while opposite him another figure falls through the stars. Commentators ascribe different meanings to these symbols as contradictory as the contents of the chest. In one reading, the hand Pandora holds up to her face makes her the figure of Ignorance.<ref> [https://scma.smith.edu/artmuseum/Collections/Cunningham-Center/Blog-paper-people/Pandora-s-Box Smith College]</ref> Alternatively her eyes are protected because she is dazzled and the snakes crawling from the chest are ancient symbols of wisdom.<ref>Count Leopoldo Cicognara, ''Le premier si\u00e8cle de la calcographie; ou, Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des estampes'', Venice 1837, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BAhaAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA533&dq=%22Les%20Sciences%20qui%20%C3%89clairent%20l'esprit%20de%20l'homme%22&pg=PA533#v=onepage&q=%22Les%20Sciences%20qui%20%C3%89clairent%20l'esprit%20de%20l'homme%22&f=false pp.532-3]</ref> Apollo, seated above, points to [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]], the zodiacal sign of January/February, which marks the \"Ascent of the Sun\" from the trough of winter. The falling figure opposite him may be identified either as [[Lucifer]] or as night fleeing before the dawn; in either case, the darkness of ignorance is about to be dispelled. The question remains whether the box thus opened will in the end be recognised as a blessing; whether the ambiguous nature of knowledge is either to help or to hurt.\n\nIn later centuries the emphasis in art has generally been on the person of Pandora. With few exceptions the box has appeared merely as her attribute. [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]'s street scene of 1951, however, one of the few modern paintings to carry the title \"Pandora's Box\", is as enigmatic as were the Renaissance allegorical prints.<ref>[http://ayay.co.uk/arts/surrealist/rene_magritte/pandoras-box.jpg Yale University Art Gallery]</ref>\n\n==Theatre==\nIn the first half of the 18th-century, three French plays were produced with the title \"Pandora's Box\" (''La Bo\u00eete \u2013 or Bo\u00ebte \u2013 de Pandore''). In each of these the main interest is in the social and human effects of the evils released from the box and in only one of them does Pandora figure as a character. The 1721 play by [[Alain Ren\u00e9 Lesage]] appeared as part of the longer ''La Fausse Foire''.<ref>''Oeuvres choisies de Lesage'', Paris 1810, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MI2LF5gfBxwC&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq=La+Bo%C3%AEte+de+Pandore+(1721),+Alain+Ren%C3%A9+Lesage&source=bl&ots=gABb__y3Mh&sig=ebCIYH5DAPIc83s5Ar7vayfg1W0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiwnaKyou7YAhWGyqQKHQDcAAQQ6AEIVzAH#v=onepage&q=La%20Bo%C3%AEte%20de%20Pandore%20(1721)%2C%20Alain%20Ren%C3%A9%20Lesage&f=false  vol.4, pp.409 \u2013 450]</ref> It was a one-act prose drama of 24 scenes in the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' style. At its opening, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] has been sent in the guise of [[Harlequin]] to check whether the box given by Jupiter to the animated statue Pandora has been opened. He proceeds to stir up disruption in her formerly happy village, unleashing ambition, competition, greed, envy, jealousy, hatred, injustice, treachery and ill-health. Amid the social breakdown, [[Pierrot]] falls out with the bride he was about to marry at the start of the play and she becomes engaged instead to a social upstart.\n\nThe play by Philippe Poisson (1682-1743) was a one-act verse comedy first produced in 1729. There Mercury visits the realm of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] to interview the ills shortly to be unleashed on mankind. The characters Old Age, Migraine, Destitution, Hatred, Envy, Paralysis, Quinsy, Fever and Transport (emotional instability) report their effects to him. They are preceded by Love, who argues that he deserves to figure among them as a bringer of social disruption.<ref>[http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/pdf/POISSON_BOITEDEPANDORE.pdf ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Classique'']</ref> The later play of 1743 was written by [[Pierre Brumoy]] and subtitled \"curiosity punished\" (''la curiosit\u00e9 punie'').<ref> [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZLxhAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false La Haye 1743]</ref> The three-act satirical verse comedy is set in the home of Epimetheus and the six children recently created by Prometheus. Mercury comes on a visit, bringing the fatal box with him. In it are the evils soon to subvert the innocence of the new creations. Firstly seven flatterers: the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of Honours, of Pleasures, Riches, Gaming (pack of cards in hand), Taste, Fashion (dressed as Harlequin) and False Knowledge. These are followed by seven bringers of evil: envy, remorse, avarice, poverty, scorn, ignorance and inconstancy. The corrupted children are rejected by Prometheus but Hope arrives at the end to bring a reconciliation.\n\nIt is evident from these plays that, in France at least, blame had shifted from Pandora to the [[trickster]] god who contrives and enjoys mankind's subversion. Although physical ills are among the plagues that visit humanity, greater emphasis is given to the disruptive passions which destroy the possibility of harmonious living.\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_-_Pandora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s painting of Pandora holding the box, 1871]]\nTwo poems in English dealing with Pandora's opening of the box are in the form of [[monologue]]s, although [[Frank Sayers]] preferred the term [[monodrama]] for his recitation with lyrical interludes, written in 1790.

Pandora opened a jar left in her care containing sickness, death and many other unspecified evils which were then released into the world.<ref>Cf. Hesiod, ''[[Works and Days]]'', (90). \"For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote and free from ills and hard toil and heavy sicknesses which bring the Fates upon men ... Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and the sea is full.

Harrison, Jane Ellen, ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek history'', Chapter II, \"The Pithoigia\", pp.42-43. Cf. also Figure 7 which shows an ancient Greek pot painting in the University of Jena where Hermes is presiding over a body in a pithos buried in the ground. \"In the vase painting in fig.7 from a lekythos in the University Museum of Jena we see a Pithoigia of quite other and solemn booty. A large pithos is sunk deep into the ground. It has served as a grave. ... The vase-painting in fig. 7 must not be regarded as an actual conscious representation of the rupent rite performed on the first day of the Anthesteria. It is more general in content; it is in fact simply a representation of ideas familiar to every Greek, that the pithos was a grave-jar, that from such grave-jars souls escaped and to them necessarily returned, and that Hermes was ''Psychopompos'', Evoker and Revoker of souls. The vase-painting is in fact only another form of the scene so often represented on Athenian white ''lekythoi'', in which the souls flutter round the grave-stele. The grave-jar is but the earlier form of sepulture; the little winged figures, the Keres, are identical in both classes of vase-painting.\"</ref> Many scholars see a close analogy between Pandora herself, who was made from clay, and the clay jar which dispenses evils.<ref>Cf. Jenifer Neils 2005, p.41 especially: \"They ignore, however, Hesiod's description of Pandora's ''pithos'' as ''arrektoisi'' or unbreakable. This adjective, which is usually applied to objects of metal, such as gold fetters and hobbles in Homer (''Il. 13.37, 15.20''), would strongly imply that the jar is made of metal rather than earthenware, which is obviously capable of being broken.\"</ref>\n\nThe mistranslation of ''pithos'' is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist [[Erasmus]] who, in his Latin account of the story of Pandora, changed the Greek ''pithos'' to ''[[Pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]]'', meaning \"box\".<ref>Meagher 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vBDfKCyC2LMC&pg=PA56 p. 56]. In his notes to Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' (p.168) M.L. West has surmised that Erasmus may have confused the story of Pandora with that found elsewhere of a box which was opened by [[Eros and Psyche|Psyche]].</ref> The context in which the story appeared was Erasmus' collection of proverbs, the ''[[Adagia]]'' (1508), in illustration of the Latin saying ''Malo accepto stultus sapit'' (from experiencing trouble a fool is made wise).

He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.<ref>Iliad, [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.24.xxiv.html 24:527ff]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a major departure from Hesiod, the 6th-century BC Greek [[elegiac]] poet [[Theognis of Megara]] states that \n<blockquote><poem>\nHope is the only good god remaining among mankind;\nthe others have left and gone to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].\nTrust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men,\nand the [[Graces]], my friend, have abandoned the earth.\nMen's judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone\nrevere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and\nmen no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety.<ref>Theognis, 1135ff.</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Epimetheus opening Pandora's box MET DP812748.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Giulio Bonasone]]\u2019s 16th century engraving of Epimetheus opening the fatal jar]]\nThe poem seems to hint at a myth in which the jar contained blessings rather than evils. It is confirmed in the new era by an [[Aesop\u2019s Fables|Aesopic]] fable recorded by [[Babrius]], in which the gods send the jar containing blessings to humans. Rather than a named female, it was a generic \"foolish man\" (\u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) who opened the jar out of curiosity and let them escape. Once the lid was replaced, only hope remained, \"promising that she will bestow on each of us the good things that have gone away.\" This [[Aetiology|aetiological]] version is numbered 312 in the [[Perry Index]].<ref>[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/312.htm Aesopica]</ref>  \n\nIn the Renaissance, the story of the jar was revisited by two immensely influential writers, [[Andrea Alciato]] in his [[Emblem book|''Emblemata'']] (1534) and the [[Neo-Latin]] poet [[Gabriele Faerno]] in his collection of a hundred fables (''Fabulum Centum'', 1563). Alciato only alluded to the story while depicting the goddess Hope seated on a jar in which, she declares, \"I alone stayed behind at home when evils fluttered all around, as the revered muse of the old poet [Hesiod] has told you\".<ref>[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/alciato/emblem.php?id=A50a044 ''In simulachrum spei'']</ref> Faerno\u2019s short poem also addressed the origin of hope but in this case it is the remainder of the \"universal blessings\" (''bona universa'') that have escaped: \"Of all good things that mortals lack,/Hope in the soul alone stays back.\"<ref>''Fabulum Centum'', London 1743, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wlATAAAAQAAJ&q=Spes#v=snippet&q=Spes&f=false Fable 94, p.216]</ref> \n\nAn idea of the nature of the blessings lost is given in a Renaissance [[engraving]] by [[Giulio Bonasone]], where the culprit is Pandora\u2019s husband, [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. He is shown holding the lid of a large storage jar from which female representations of the Roman virtues are flying up into the air. They are identified by their names in Latin: security ([[salus]]), harmony ([[Concordia (mythology)|concordia]]), fairness ([[aequitas]]), mercy ([[clementia]]), freedom ([[libertas]]), happiness ([[felicitas]]), peace ([[Pax (goddess)|pax]]), worth ([[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]) and joy ([[Laetitia_(goddess)|laetitia]]). Hope ([[spes]]) is delayed on the lip and holds aloft the flower that is her attribute.<ref>[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/392735 Metropolitan Museum]</ref>\n\n==Difficulties of interpretation==\nIn Hesiodic scholarship, the interpretive [[crux (literary)|crux]] has endured:<ref> Though Pandora was not a subject of medieval art, Dora Panofsky and Erwin Panofsky examined the post-Renaissance ''mythos'', see Bibliography</ref> Is the hope imprisoned within a jar full of evils to be considered a benefit for humanity, or a further curse? A number of mythology textbooks echo the sentiments of M. L. West: \"[Hope's retention in the jar] is comforting, and we are to be thankful for this antidote to our present ills.\"<ref>West 1978, p. 169.</ref> Some scholars such as Mark Griffith, however, take the opposite view: \"[Hope] seems to be a blessing withheld from men so that their life should be the more dreary and depressing.\"<ref>Griffith 1983:250.</ref> One's interpretation hangs on two related questions: First, how are we to render ''[[elpis]]'', the Greek word usually translated as \"hope\"? Second, does the jar preserve ''Elpis'' for men, or keep ''Elpis'' away from men?\n\nAs with most ancient Greek words, ''elpis'' can be translated a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of \"expectation.\" Classical authors use the word ''elpis'' to mean \"expectation of bad,\" as well as \"expectation of good.\" Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of extant ancient Greek literature.<ref>Leinieks 1984, 1\u20134.</ref> Others hold the minority view that ''elpis'' should be rendered, \"expectation of evil\" (''vel sim'').<ref name=\"Verdenius1985\">E.g., Verdenius 1985; Blumer 2001.</ref>\n\nHow one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a [[pantry]]?<ref>The prison/pantry terminology comes from Verdenius 1985 ad 96.</ref> The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released \u2013 they only affect humanity once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for ''Elpis'' as well, withholding it from the human race.<ref>Scholars holding this view (e.g., Walcot 1961, 250) point out that the jar is termed an \"unbreakable\" (in Greek: ''arrektos'') house. In Greek literature (e.g., Homer, and elsewhere in Hesiod), the word ''arrektos'' is applied to structures meant to sequester or otherwise restrain its contents.</ref> If one takes ''elpis'' to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.<ref>See Griffith 1984 above.</ref> A less pessimistic interpretation understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but each of us is hopelessly human.<ref>Thus [[Apostolos Athanassakis|Athanassakis]] 1983 in his commentary ad ''Works'' 96.</ref>\n\nIt is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for humanity, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes humanity lazy by taking away their industriousness, making them prone to evil.<ref>Cf. Jenifer Neils, in ''The Girl in the Pithos: Hesiod's Elpis'', in [https://books.google.com/books?id=6yi6XtAI6GwC&printsec=frontcover \"Periklean Athens and its Legacy. Problems and Perspectives\"], pp.&nbsp;40\u201341 especially.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that \"Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\"<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''Human, All Too Human''. Cf. Section Two, On the History of Moral Feelings, aph. 71. \"Hope. Pandora brought the jar with the evils and opened it. It was the gods' gift to man, on the outside a beautiful, enticing gift, called the 'lucky jar.' Then all the evils, those lively, winged beings, flew out of it. Since that time, they roam around and do harm to men by day and night. One single evil had not yet slipped out of the jar. As Zeus had wished, Pandora slammed the top down and it remained inside. So now man has the lucky jar in his house forever and thinks the world of the treasure. It is at his service; he reaches for it when he fancies it. For he does not know that the jar which Pandora brought was the jar of evils, and he takes the remaining evil for the greatest worldly good\u2014it is hope, for Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\"</ref>\n\nAn objection to the ''hope is good/the jar is a prison'' interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope \u2013 a blessing \u2013 doing among them? This objection leads some to render ''elpis'' as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although mankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable.<ref name=\"Verdenius1985\" />\n\nThe optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. ''Elpis'' takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, \"It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one.\"<ref>West 1978, 169\u201370.</ref> Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.<ref>Taking the jar to serve as a prison at some times and as a pantry at others will also accommodate another pessimistic interpretation of the myth. In this reading, attention is paid to the phrase ''moune Elpis'' \u2013 \"only Hope,\" or \"Hope alone.\" A minority opinion construes the phrase instead to mean \"empty Hope\" or \"baseless Hope\": not only are humans plagued by a multitude of evils, but they persist in the fruitless hope that things might get better. Thus Beall 1989 227\u201328.</ref>\n\n==Fixing the blame==\nNeither Alciato nor Faerno had named who was responsible for opening the jar beyond saying it was a \"mortal\". During the Renaissance it is the name of Epimetheus that is mentioned as often as not, as in the engraving by Bonasone noticed above and the mention of Pandora's partner in a [[rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]] that [[Isaac de Benserade]] took it on himself to insert into his light-hearted version of the [[Metamorphoses]] (1676) - although [[Ovid]] had not in fact written about it himself.\n[[File:S\u00e9bastien Le Clerc - Pandora and Epimetheus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Pandora seated with her husband Epimetheus, who has just opened her jar of curses; an etching by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Clerc]] (1676)]]\n\n<blockquote><poem>::In a jar an odious treasure is\n::Shut by the gods\u2019 wish:\n::A gift that\u2019s not everyday,\n::The owner\u2019s Pandora alone; \n::And her eyes, this in hand,\n::Command the best in the land \n::As she flits near and far; \n::Prettiness can\u2019t stay\n::Shut in a jar.\n::Someone took her eye, he took\n::A look at what pleased her so\n::And out came the grief and woe\n::We won\u2018t ever be rid of,\n::For heaven had hidden\n::That in the jar.</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe etching by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Clerc]] that accompanied the poem in the book shows Pandora and Epimetheus seated on either side of a jar from which clouds of smoke emerge, carrying up the escaping evils. The lid of the jar is quite plainly in Epimetheus\u2019 hand.<ref>Panofsky 1956, [https://www.scribd.com/document/365690708/Pandoras-Box-The-Changing-Aspects-of-a-Mythical-Symbol-by-Dora-and-Erwin-Panofsky-Art-eBook p.79]</ref> [[Paolo Farinati]], an earlier Venetian artist, was also responsible for a print which laid the blame on Epimetheus, depicting him as lifting the lid from the jar that Pandora is holding. Out of it boils a cloud which carries up a man and a dragon; between them they support a scroll reading \"''sero nimirum sapere caepit''\" (finding out too late), in reference to the meaning of Epimetheus' name in Greek\n.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.or/wiki/File:Pandora%27s_gift_to_Epimetheus.jpg Wikimedia]</ref>\n\n[[File:Pandora allegory 1557.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|An Allegory of ''Les Sciences qui \u00c9clairent l'esprit de l'homme'' (The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit, 1557), an etching ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro]]\nAnother Venetian print, ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro (active 1565 \u2013 1586), is much more enigmatic. Usually titled \"Pandora's Box, or The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit\", it portrays a woman in antique dress opening an ornate coffer from which spill books, manuscripts, snakes and bats. By Pandora's side is a woman carrying a burning brand, while a horned figure flees in the opposite direction. Above is a curved vault painted with signs of the zodiac to which the sun-god [[Apollo]] is pointing, while opposite him another figure falls through the stars. Commentators ascribe different meanings to these symbols as contradictory as the contents of the chest. In one reading, the hand Pandora holds up to her face makes her the figure of Ignorance.<ref> [https://scma.smith.edu/artmuseum/Collections/Cunningham-Center/Blog-paper-people/Pandora-s-Box Smith College]</ref> Alternatively her eyes are protected because she is dazzled and the snakes crawling from the chest are ancient symbols of wisdom.<ref>Count Leopoldo Cicognara, ''Le premier si\u00e8cle de la calcographie; ou, Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des estampes'', Venice 1837, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BAhaAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA533&dq=%22Les%20Sciences%20qui%20%C3%89clairent%20l'esprit%20de%20l'homme%22&pg=PA533#v=onepage&q=%22Les%20Sciences%20qui%20%C3%89clairent%20l'esprit%20de%20l'homme%22&f=false pp.532-3]</ref> Apollo, seated above, points to [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]], the zodiacal sign of January/February, which marks the \"Ascent of the Sun\" from the trough of winter. The falling figure opposite him may be identified either as [[Lucifer]] or as night fleeing before the dawn; in either case, the darkness of ignorance is about to be dispelled. The question remains whether the box thus opened will in the end be recognised as a blessing; whether the ambiguous nature of knowledge is either to help or to hurt.\n\nIn later centuries the emphasis in art has generally been on the person of Pandora. With few exceptions the box has appeared merely as her attribute. [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]'s street scene of 1951, however, one of the few modern paintings to carry the title \"Pandora's Box\", is as enigmatic as were the Renaissance allegorical prints.<ref>[http://ayay.co.uk/arts/surrealist/rene_magritte/pandoras-box.jpg Yale University Art Gallery]</ref>\n\n==Theatre==\nIn the first half of the 18th-century, three French plays were produced with the title \"Pandora's Box\" (''La Bo\u00eete \u2013 or Bo\u00ebte \u2013 de Pandore''). In each of these the main interest is in the social and human effects of the evils released from the box and in only one of them does Pandora figure as a character. The 1721 play by [[Alain Ren\u00e9 Lesage]] appeared as part of the longer ''La Fausse Foire''.<ref>''Oeuvres choisies de Lesage'', Paris 1810, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MI2LF5gfBxwC&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq=La+Bo%C3%AEte+de+Pandore+(1721),+Alain+Ren%C3%A9+Lesage&source=bl&ots=gABb__y3Mh&sig=ebCIYH5DAPIc83s5Ar7vayfg1W0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiwnaKyou7YAhWGyqQKHQDcAAQQ6AEIVzAH#v=onepage&q=La%20Bo%C3%AEte%20de%20Pandore%20(1721)%2C%20Alain%20Ren%C3%A9%20Lesage&f=false  vol.4, pp.409 \u2013 450]</ref> It was a one-act prose drama of 24 scenes in the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' style. At its opening, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] has been sent in the guise of [[Harlequin]] to check whether the box given by Jupiter to the animated statue Pandora has been opened. He proceeds to stir up disruption in her formerly happy village, unleashing ambition, competition, greed, envy, jealousy, hatred, injustice, treachery and ill-health. Amid the social breakdown, [[Pierrot]] falls out with the bride he was about to marry at the start of the play and she becomes engaged instead to a social upstart.\n\nThe play by Philippe Poisson (1682-1743) was a one-act verse comedy first produced in 1729. There Mercury visits the realm of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] to interview the ills shortly to be unleashed on mankind. The characters Old Age, Migraine, Destitution, Hatred, Envy, Paralysis, Quinsy, Fever and Transport (emotional instability) report their effects to him. They are preceded by Love, who argues that he deserves to figure among them as a bringer of social disruption.<ref>[http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/pdf/POISSON_BOITEDEPANDORE.pdf ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Classique'']</ref> The later play of 1743 was written by [[Pierre Brumoy]] and subtitled \"curiosity punished\" (''la curiosit\u00e9 punie'').<ref> [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZLxhAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false La Haye 1743]</ref> The three-act satirical verse comedy is set in the home of Epimetheus and the six children recently created by Prometheus. Mercury comes on a visit, bringing the fatal box with him. In it are the evils soon to subvert the innocence of the new creations. Firstly seven flatterers: the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of Honours, of Pleasures, Riches, Gaming (pack of cards in hand), Taste, Fashion (dressed as Harlequin) and False Knowledge. These are followed by seven bringers of evil: envy, remorse, avarice, poverty, scorn, ignorance and inconstancy. The corrupted children are rejected by Prometheus but Hope arrives at the end to bring a reconciliation.\n\nIt is evident from these plays that, in France at least, blame had shifted from Pandora to the [[trickster]] god who contrives and enjoys mankind's subversion. Although physical ills are among the plagues that visit humanity, greater emphasis is given to the disruptive passions which destroy the possibility of harmonious living.\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_-_Pandora.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s painting of Pandora holding the box, 1871]]\nTwo poems in English dealing with Pandora's opening of the box are in the form of [[monologue]]s, although [[Frank Sayers]] preferred the term [[monodrama]] for his recitation with lyrical interludes, written in 1790. In this Pandora is descending from Heaven after being endowed with gifts by the gods and therefore feels empowered to open the casket she carries, releasing strife, care, pride, hatred and despair. Only the voice of Hope is left to comfort her at the end.<ref>''Poems'', Norwich 1803, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fYc1AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=pandora++frank+sayers&source=bl&ots=O19HarVkw3&sig=FUdLaNcl8LTJIB3JyGM0ybIRRtE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhpLTMuqbZAhUsAsAKHQeKDIcQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&q=pandora%20%20frank%20sayers&f=false pp.213-19]</ref> In the poem by Samuel Phelps Leland (1839-1910), Pandora has already arrived in the household of Epimetheus and feels equally confident that she is privileged to satisfy her curiosity, but with a worse result. Shutting the lid too early, she thus \"let loose all curses on mankind/ Without a hope to mitigate their pain\".<ref>''Poems'', Chicago 1866, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6xRIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA24&dq=Pandora+poem&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwicmOnRvqbZAhWMZVAKHW7SAkA4ChDoAQhCMAU#v=onepage&q=Pandora%20poem&f=false pp.24-5]</ref> This is the dilemma expressed in the sonnet that [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote to accompany his oil painting of 1869\u201371. The gifts with which Pandora has been endowed and that made her desirable are ultimately subverted, \"the good things turned to ill\u2026Nor canst thou know/ If Hope still pent there be alive or dead.\"<ref>[http://www.rossettiarchive.org/img/1-1881.1stedn.270-271.jpg Rossetti Archive]</ref> In his painting Rossetti underlines the point as a fiery halo streams upward from the opening casket on which is inscribed the motto ''NESCITUR IGNESCITUR'' (unknown it burns). \n\nWhile the speakers of the verse monologues are characters hurt by their own simplicity, Rossetti's painting of the red-robed Pandora, with her expressive gaze and elongated hands about the jewelled casket, is a more ambiguous figure. So too is the girl in [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]'s watercolour of Pandora (see above), as the comments of some of its interpreters indicate. Sideways against a seascape, red haired and naked, she gazes down at the urn lifted towards her \"with a look of animal curiosity\", according to one contemporary reviewer,<ref>''The Pall Mall Budget'' 1882, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=erg_AQAAMAAJ&q=Alma-Tadema+Pandora&dq=Alma-Tadema+Pandora&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfksXqpqbZAhVLKlAKHSAhDLY4ChDoAQhMMAc vol. 27, p.14]</ref> or else \"lost in contemplation of some treasure from the deep\" according to another account.<ref>''The Life and Work of L. Alma Tadema'', Art Journal Office, 1888, p.22</ref> A moulded sphinx on the unopened lid of the urn is turned in her direction. In the iconography of the time, such a figure is usually associated with the ''femme fatale'',<ref>Lothar H\u00f6nnighausen, ''Pr\u00e4raphaeliten und Fin de Si\u00e8cle'', Cambridge University 1988, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VSL6R6tSJMYC&lpg=PA234&dq=%22femme%20fatale%22%20sphinx&pg=PA232#v=onepage&q=%22femme%20fatale%22%20sphinx&f=false pp.232-40]</ref> but in this case the crown of hyacinths about her head identifies Pandora as an innocent Greek maiden.<ref>Victoria Sherrow, ''Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History'', Greenwood Publishing Group 2006, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&lpg=PA1&ots=YM-eBWldp7&dq=hyacinths%20in%20hair%20%22Greece%22%20%20-pinterest%20-Poe&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=hyacinths%20in%20hair%20%22Greece%22%20%20-pinterest%20-Poe&f=false A]</ref> Nevertheless, the presence of the sphinx at which she gazes with such curiosity suggests a personality on the cusp, on the verge of gaining some harmful knowledge that will henceforth negate her uncomplicated qualities.

I learned how to read that way.</ref> and in 1988 he published ''[[Visitors from Oz]]'', based on the characters in Baum's various Oz books. Gardner was a founding member of the [[International Wizard of Oz Club]], and winner of its 1971 L. Frank Baum Memorial Award. His other novel was ''The Flight of Peter Fromm'' (1973), which reflected his lifelong fascination with religious belief and the problem of faith.<ref>Brown (2010):  Faith was also the subject of his 1973 semi-autobiographical novel, \"The Flight of Peter Fromm,\" in which the title character and his atheist professor of divinity grapple for decades with questions about God.</ref>\n\nHis short stories were collected in ''The No-Sided Professor and Other Tales of Fantasy, Humor, Mystery, and Philosophy'' (1987).<ref name=allyn_jackson/>\n\n==Autobiography==\nAt the age of 95 Gardner wrote ''Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner''.

For several years starting in 1953 he was a managing editor of ''Polly Pigtails'', a magazine for young girls, and also wrote under that name. His ''Annotated Casey at the Bat'' (1967) included a parody of the poem, attributed to \"Nitram Rendrag\" (his name spelled backwards).

Davis]] and [[Reuben Hersh]] and ''What Is Mathematics, Really?'' by Hersh, both of which were critical of aspects of [[mathematical Platonism]], and the first of which was well received by the mathematical community. While Gardner was often perceived as a hard-core Platonist, his reviews demonstrated some [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] tendencies. Gardner maintained that his views are widespread among mathematicians, but Hersh has countered that in his experience as a professional mathematician and speaker, this is not the case.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hersh |first=Reuben |date=31 October 1997 |title=Re: Martin Gardner book review |work=Foundations of Mathematics mailing list |url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1997-November/000128.html |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Other views==\nOver the years Gardner held forth on many contemporary issues, arguing for his points of view in fields from [[general semantics]] to [[fuzzy logic]] to watching TV (he once wrote a negative review of [[Jerry Mander]]'s book ''[[Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television]]'').<ref>{{cite book |date= |title=Science, good, bad, and bogus \u2013 Martin Gardner \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Science_good_bad_and_bogus.html?id=d77aAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> He was a frequent contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/search/?s=by+martin+gardner Reviews by and about Martin Gardner] The New York Review of Books: 1973 to 1998</ref> His philosophical views are described and defended in his book ''The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener'' (1983, revised 1999).<ref name=Night_is_Large/>\n\n==Legacy and awards==\nThe numerous awards Gardner received include:<ref>[http://martin-gardner.org/Awards.html Martin Gardner's Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318223932/http://martin-gardner.org/Awards.html |date=2016-03-18 }}</ref>\n* 1987 - [[Leroy P.

His semi-autobiographical novel ''The Flight of Peter Fromm'' depicts a traditionally Protestant Christian man struggling with his faith, examining 20th century scholarship and intellectual movements and ultimately rejecting Christianity while remaining a theist.<ref name=george_groth/>\n\nGardner said that he suspected that the fundamental nature of human [[consciousness]] may not be knowable or discoverable, unless perhaps a physics more profound than (\"underlying\") [[quantum mechanics]] is some day developed. In this regard, he said, he was an adherent of the \"[[New Mysterianism]]\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160131235956/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/mind_at_play_an_interview_with_martin_gardner \"A Mind at Play: An Interview with Martin Gardner\"] by [[Kendrick Frazier]], ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' Volume 22.2, March/April 1998</ref>\n\n==Annotated works==\nGardner was considered a leading authority on [[Lewis Carroll]]. His annotated version of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking Glass]]'', explaining the many mathematical riddles, wordplay, and literary references found in the Alice books, was first published as ''The Annotated Alice'' (Clarkson Potter, 1960). Sequels were published with new annotations as ''More Annotated Alice'' (Random House, 1990), and finally as ''The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition'' (Norton, 1999), combining notes from the earlier editions and new material.<ref>Dirda (2009):  With this book Gardner virtually launched the entire mini-genre of annotated classics.</ref> The original book arose when Gardner found the Alice books \"sort of frightening\" when he was young, but found them fascinating as an adult.<ref>Jan Susina. ''Conversation with Martin Gardner: Annotator of Wonderland.'' ''The Five Owls.'' Jan./Feb. 2000. 62\u201364.</ref> He felt that someone ought to annotate them, and suggested to a publisher that [[Bertrand Russell]] be asked; when the publisher was unable to get past Russell's secretary, Gardner was asked to take on the project himself.<ref name=alice>[http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/alice-still-lives-here/Content?oid=1184525 Alice Still Lives Here] by Michael Sims, [[Nashville Scene]],  July 06, 2000</ref>\n\nThere had long been annotated books written by scholars for other scholars, but Gardner was the first to write such a work for the general public,<ref name=richards_2018>Richards (2018)</ref> and soon many other writers followed his lead.<ref>Kindley (2015): Just as importantly, though,\u00a0''The Annotated Alice''\u00a0gave rise to a new popular genre.</ref><ref>Richards (2018): The look and feel was entirely due to Martin Gardner.</ref> Gardner himself went on to produce annotated editions of G. K. Chesterton's ''[[Father Brown|The Innocence Of Father Brown]]'' and ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'', as well as of celebrated poems including ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', ''[[Casey at the Bat]]'', ''[[The Night Before Christmas]]'', and ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''.<ref name=origami/>\n\n==Novels and short stories==\nGardner wrote two novels.  He was a perennial fan of the [[Oz books]] written by [[L. Frank Baum]],<ref>MacTutor:  My mother read ''The Wizard of Oz'' to me when I was a little boy, and I looked over her shoulder as she read it. I learned how to read that way.</ref> and in 1988 he published ''[[Visitors from Oz]]'', based on the characters in Baum's various Oz books. Gardner was a founding member of the [[International Wizard of Oz Club]], and winner of its 1971 L. Frank Baum Memorial Award. His other novel was ''The Flight of Peter Fromm'' (1973), which reflected his lifelong fascination with religious belief and the problem of faith.<ref>Brown (2010):  Faith was also the subject of his 1973 semi-autobiographical novel, \"The Flight of Peter Fromm,\" in which the title character and his atheist professor of divinity grapple for decades with questions about God.</ref>\n\nHis short stories were collected in ''The No-Sided Professor and Other Tales of Fantasy, Humor, Mystery, and Philosophy'' (1987).<ref name=allyn_jackson/>\n\n==Autobiography==\nAt the age of 95 Gardner wrote ''Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner''.  He was living in a one-room apartment in Norman, Oklahoma and, as was his custom, wrote it on a typewriter and edited it using scissors and rubber cement.<ref name=teller>Teller (2014)</ref> He took the title from a poem, a so-called [[grook]], by his good friend Piet Hein,<ref>[http://www.leptonica.com/cachedpages/grooks/grooks.html Grooks by Piet Hein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010004135/http://www.leptonica.com/cachedpages/grooks/grooks.html |date=2014-10-10 }}</ref> which perfectly expresses Gardner's abiding sense of mystery and wonder about existence.<ref>''[https://www.ams.org/notices/201403/rnoti-p281.pdf Undiluted Hocus-Pocus]'', Princeton University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0691159911}}, Reviewed by [[Andy Magid]]</ref>\n{{poemquote|\nWe glibly talk\n of nature's laws\nbut do things have\n a natural cause?\n\nBlack earth turned into\n yellow crocus\nis undiluted\n hocus-pocus.\n}}\n\n==Word play==\nGardner's interest in wordplay led him to conceive of a magazine on [[recreational linguistics]].  In 1967 he pitched the idea to [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Periodicals]] and nominated [[Dmitri Borgmann]] as editor.<ref name=undiluted>Eckler, A. Ross (2010) [https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol43/iss3/6/ \"Look Back!\"] Word Ways: Vol 43: Issue 3, Article 6</ref> The resulting journal, ''[[Word Ways]]'', carried many of his articles; {{as of |2013|lc=y}} it was still publishing his submissions posthumously.  He also wrote a \"Puzzle Tale\" column for ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine from 1977 to 1986. Gardner was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club, the [[Trap Door Spiders]], which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers, the [[Black Widowers]].<ref>[http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2008/10/the-martin-gardner-interview-part-4/ Don Albers' interview of Gardner, Part 4: The Trap Door Spiders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119143846/http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2008/10/the-martin-gardner-interview-part-4/ |date=2008-11-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Pen names==\nGardner often used pen names.  In 1952, while working for the children's magazine ''[[Humpty Dumpty (magazine)|Humpty Dumpty]]'', he contributed stories written by \"Humpty Dumpty Jnr\". For several years starting in 1953 he was a managing editor of ''Polly Pigtails'', a magazine for young girls, and also wrote under that name. His ''Annotated Casey at the Bat'' (1967) included a parody of the poem, attributed to \"Nitram Rendrag\" (his name spelled backwards).  Using the pen name \"Uriah Fuller\", he wrote two books attacking the alleged psychic [[Uri Geller]]. In later years, Gardner often wrote parodies of his favorite poems under the name \"Armand T. Ringer\", an [[anagram]] of his name.<ref name=alters>[http://martin-gardner.org/Top10MGAE.html Top 10 Martin Gardner Alter Egos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317115739/http://martin-gardner.org/Top10MGAE.html |date=2017-03-17 }} at martin-gardner.org</ref>  In 1983 one George Groth panned Gardner's book ''The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener'' in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.  Only in the last line of the review was it revealed that George Groth was Martin Gardner himself.<ref name=Night_is_Large>\"Gardner's Whys\" in ''The Night is Large'', chapter 40, pp. 481\u201387.</ref>\n\nIn his January 1960 \"Mathematical Games\" column, Gardner introduced the fictitious \"[[Dr. Matrix]]\" and wrote about him often over the next two decades.  Dr. Matrix was not exactly a pen name, although Gardner did pretend that everything in these columns came from the fertile mind of the good doctor.  Then in 1979 Dr. Matrix himself published an article in the quite respectable ''[[Two-Year College Mathematics Journal]]''.<ref>Matrix, Irving Joshua (1979). ''Martin Gardner: Defending the Honor of the Human Mind'', The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal, Vol. 10, No. 4 (Sep., 1979), pp. 227-232.</ref> It was called ''Martin Gardner: Defending the Honor of the Human Mind'' and contained a biography of Gardner and a history of his \"Mathematical Games\" column.  It would be a further decade before Martin published an article in such a mathematics journal under his own name.<ref name=alters/>\n\n==Philosophy of mathematics==\nGardner was known for his sometimes controversial philosophy of mathematics.<ref name=cryptozoo>[http://www.cryptozoonews.com/gardner-obit/ Skeptic Martin Gardner Dies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002135149/http://www.cryptozoonews.com/gardner-obit/ |date=2015-10-02 }} by Loren Coleman, CryptoZoo News, May 23, 2010</ref>  He wrote negative reviews of ''[[The Mathematical Experience]]'' by [[Philip J. Davis]] and [[Reuben Hersh]] and ''What Is Mathematics, Really?'' by Hersh, both of which were critical of aspects of [[mathematical Platonism]], and the first of which was well received by the mathematical community. While Gardner was often perceived as a hard-core Platonist, his reviews demonstrated some [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] tendencies. Gardner maintained that his views are widespread among mathematicians, but Hersh has countered that in his experience as a professional mathematician and speaker, this is not the case.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hersh |first=Reuben |date=31 October 1997 |title=Re: Martin Gardner book review |work=Foundations of Mathematics mailing list |url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1997-November/000128.html |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Other views==\nOver the years Gardner held forth on many contemporary issues, arguing for his points of view in fields from [[general semantics]] to [[fuzzy logic]] to watching TV (he once wrote a negative review of [[Jerry Mander]]'s book ''[[Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television]]'').<ref>{{cite book |date= |title=Science, good, bad, and bogus \u2013 Martin Gardner \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Science_good_bad_and_bogus.html?id=d77aAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> He was a frequent contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/search/?s=by+martin+gardner Reviews by and about Martin Gardner] The New York Review of Books: 1973 to 1998</ref> His philosophical views are described and defended in his book ''The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener'' (1983, revised 1999).<ref name=Night_is_Large/>\n\n==Legacy and awards==\nThe numerous awards Gardner received include:<ref>[http://martin-gardner.org/Awards.html Martin Gardner's Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318223932/http://martin-gardner.org/Awards.html |date=2016-03-18 }}</ref>\n* 1987 - [[Leroy P.

{"title_page": "Triangular trade", "text_new": "{{short description|Trade among three ports or regions}}\n[[Image:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|350px|Depiction of the classical model of the triangular trade]]\n[[Image:Triangular trade.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Depiction of the triangular trade of slaves, sugar, and rum with New England instead of Europe as the third corner]]\n\n'''Triangular trade''' or '''triangle trade''' is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]. Accessed 6 November 2007.</ref> The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial [[cash crop]]s, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the [[sea lane]] west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called [[Middle Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triangular Trade|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125125048/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref> Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, [[Pope Nicholas V]], in the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal \"full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the [[Saracens]] [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teaching|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2003|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=67}}</ref>\n[[Image:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the stowage of African slaves on a British [[slave ship]].]] \n\nA classic example is the [[colonial molasses trade]]. Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\n[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  (\"I.C. 1760\"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]\n[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.  Accessed 28 March 2007.</ref>  When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the [[Middle Passage]] from Africa to the [[New World]]. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the [[slave ship]]s. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,<ref>A. P. Middleton, ''Tobacco Coast''.</ref> from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from [[Virginia]], [[tobacco]] and [[hemp]]. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.\n\nHowever, because of several disadvantages that slave ships faced compared to other trade ships, they often returned to their home port carrying whatever goods were readily available in the Americas and filled up a large part or all of their capacity with ballast. Other disadvantages include the different form of the ships (to carry as many humans as possible, but not ideal to carry a maximum amount of produce) and the variations in the duration of a slave voyage, making it practically impossible to pre-schedule appointments in the Americas, which meant that slave ships often arrived in the Americas out-of-season.  When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage.  Due to the slaves being transported in tight, confined spaces, a significant percentage of the group that started perished on board or shortly after arrival due to disease and lack of nourishment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Death Toll From The Slave Trade|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/Reports/Slavedeathtoll/slaverydeathtoll.html|publisher=World Future Fund|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=|date=March 2018}} Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back, mitigating the impact of the slaves' involvement.

Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]. Accessed 6 November 2007.</ref> The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial [[cash crop]]s, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the [[sea lane]] west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called [[Middle Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triangular Trade|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125125048/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref> Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, [[Pope Nicholas V]], in the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal \"full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the [[Saracens]] [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teaching|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2003|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=67}}</ref>\n[[Image:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the stowage of African slaves on a British [[slave ship]].]] \n\nA classic example is the [[colonial molasses trade]]. Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\n[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  (\"I.C. 1760\"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]\n[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.  Accessed 28 March 2007.</ref>  When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the [[Middle Passage]] from Africa to the [[New World]]. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the [[slave ship]]s. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,<ref>A. P. Middleton, ''Tobacco Coast''.</ref> from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from [[Virginia]], [[tobacco]] and [[hemp]]. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.\n\nHowever, because of several disadvantages that slave ships faced compared to other trade ships, they often returned to their home port carrying whatever goods were readily available in the Americas and filled up a large part or all of their capacity with ballast. Other disadvantages include the different form of the ships (to carry as many humans as possible, but not ideal to carry a maximum amount of produce) and the variations in the duration of a slave voyage, making it practically impossible to pre-schedule appointments in the Americas, which meant that slave ships often arrived in the Americas out-of-season.

Written by [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and directed by [[Bryan Cranston]], it aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and Canada on August 11, 2013 as the mid-season premiere.\n\nThe episode received high critical acclaim, with critics praising the flashforward scene in the beginning, the ending scene and the performances from [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Dean Norris]]. For his performance in the episode, Norris was called \"Performer of the Week\" by [[TVLine]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[flashforward]], a 52-year-old [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|arrives]] at his abandoned and fenced-off house, following the events of \"[[Live Free or Die (Breaking Bad)|Live Free or Die]]\". Walt enters and sees \"HEISENBERG\" [[graffiti|spray-painted]] on the living room wall. Observing the house's dilapidated state, which includes a group of teenagers using his emptied pool to skateboard, he retrieves the hidden vial of [[ricin]] from his bedroom. As he leaves he greets his former neighbor, Carol, who is shocked by his presence.\n\nIn the present, [[Hank Schrader]] reels from [[Gliding Over All|finding]] [[Gale Boetticher]]'s handwritten dedication found in Walt's copy of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', finally realizing that Walt, his brother-in-law, was Heisenberg all along. After excusing himself and his wife [[Marie Schrader|Marie]] from the party at Walt's house, Hank swerves his car off the road on the way home while suffering a [[panic attack]]. Hank feigns an illness to work from home and takes the opportunity to review case files on Heisenberg and [[Gus Fring]]. Hank links people, events, and circumstances, as well as matching the handwriting in the ''Leaves of Grass'' dedication with that of the [[Bullet Points (Breaking Bad)|bullet points]] from Gale's lab notebook, to confirm that Walt is Heisenberg.\n\nWalt, who has left the [[Methamphetamine|meth]] business, discusses ways to [[money laundering|launder]] his drug money faster with his wife [[Skyler White|Skyler]], with expansion of their car wash business as an aim. [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Lydia Rodarte-Quayle|Lydia]] shows up at the car wash looking distressed and pleads for Walt to return, as the quality of the meth since his retirement has fallen below acceptable standards, jeopardizing their deal. However, Walt dismisses her and Skyler warns her never to come back. It is later revealed that Walt's [[cancer]] has returned, but he keeps this from his family and undergoes [[chemotherapy]] again.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jesse Pinkman]] feels guilty over his role in Walt's meth business, and is particularly distraught over the deaths of [[Dead Freight|Drew Sharp]] and (he assumes) Mike Ehrmantraut. He gives all the money [[Gliding Over All|he received]] from Walt to [[Saul Goodman]] and asks him to deliver it to Mike's granddaughter and Drew's family. Saul refuses, advising it would raise suspicions, and reports this to Walt. Walt visits Jesse to return his money and lies to him, telling him that Mike is probably still alive somewhere and does not need help taking care of his granddaughter. Jesse is still distressed and later gives a $10,000 bundle to a homeless man. He then drives through a neighborhood throwing more bundles of cash onto front lawns.\n\nIn his bathroom, Walt finds his copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' missing. Alarmed at the coincidental timing of Hank's apparent illness, his suspicions are deepened when he discovers a [[global positioning system|GPS]] tracker on his car. He shows up at Hank's garage to ask about the tracker. An enraged Hank punches Walt and accuses him of being Heisenberg, which Walt neither confirms nor denies. Walt tells Hank that he would have difficulty proving he is Heisenberg, and even if he did his cancer will probably kill him before he can be jailed.

Written by [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and directed by [[Bryan Cranston]], it aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and Canada on August 11, 2013 as the mid-season premiere.\n\nThe episode received high critical acclaim, with critics praising the flashforward scene in the beginning, the ending scene and the performances from [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Dean Norris]]. For his performance in the episode, Norris was called \"Performer of the Week\" by [[TVLine]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[flashforward]], a 52-year-old [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] [[Felina (Breaking Bad)|arrives]] at his abandoned and fenced-off house, following the events of \"[[Live Free or Die (Breaking Bad)|Live Free or Die]]\". Walt enters and sees \"HEISENBERG\" [[graffiti|spray-painted]] on the living room wall. Observing the house's dilapidated state, which includes a group of teenagers using his emptied pool to skateboard, he retrieves the hidden vial of [[ricin]] from his bedroom. As he leaves he greets his former neighbor, Carol, who is shocked by his presence.\n\nIn the present, [[Hank Schrader]] reels from [[Gliding Over All|finding]] [[Gale Boetticher]]'s handwritten dedication found in Walt's copy of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', finally realizing that Walt, his brother-in-law, was Heisenberg all along. After excusing himself and his wife [[Marie Schrader|Marie]] from the party at Walt's house, Hank swerves his car off the road on the way home while suffering a [[panic attack]]. Hank feigns an illness to work from home and takes the opportunity to review case files on Heisenberg and [[Gus Fring]]. Hank links people, events, and circumstances, as well as matching the handwriting in the ''Leaves of Grass'' dedication with that of the [[Bullet Points (Breaking Bad)|bullet points]] from Gale's lab notebook, to confirm that Walt is Heisenberg.\n\nWalt, who has left the [[Methamphetamine|meth]] business, discusses ways to [[money laundering|launder]] his drug money faster with his wife [[Skyler White|Skyler]], with expansion of their car wash business as an aim. [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Lydia Rodarte-Quayle|Lydia]] shows up at the car wash looking distressed and pleads for Walt to return, as the quality of the meth since his retirement has fallen below acceptable standards, jeopardizing their deal. However, Walt dismisses her and Skyler warns her never to come back. It is later revealed that Walt's [[cancer]] has returned, but he keeps this from his family and undergoes [[chemotherapy]] again.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jesse Pinkman]] feels guilty over his role in Walt's meth business, and is particularly distraught over the deaths of [[Dead Freight|Drew Sharp]] and (he assumes) Mike Ehrmantraut. He gives all the money [[Gliding Over All|he received]] from Walt to [[Saul Goodman]] and asks him to deliver it to Mike's granddaughter and Drew's family. Saul refuses, advising it would raise suspicions, and reports this to Walt. Walt visits Jesse to return his money and lies to him, telling him that Mike is probably still alive somewhere and does not need help taking care of his granddaughter. Jesse is still distressed and later gives a $10,000 bundle to a homeless man. He then drives through a neighborhood throwing more bundles of cash onto front lawns.\n\nIn his bathroom, Walt finds his copy of ''Leaves of Grass'' missing. Alarmed at the coincidental timing of Hank's apparent illness, his suspicions are deepened when he discovers a [[global positioning system|GPS]] tracker on his car. He shows up at Hank's garage to ask about the tracker. An enraged Hank punches Walt and accuses him of being Heisenberg, which Walt neither confirms nor denies. Walt tells Hank that he would have difficulty proving he is Heisenberg, and even if he did his cancer will probably kill him before he can be jailed. Hank demands Walt leave his children in Hank's care before he will consider Walt's argument, but is refused. Hank utters that he does not know him anymore, to which Walt replies, \"If that's true, if you don't know who I am, then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Dedication===\nThe episode is dedicated to Kevin Cordasco, a sixteen-year-old fan of ''Breaking Bad'' who had met several members of the series' cast and crew; Cordasco died earlier in 2013 from [[neuroblastoma]].
