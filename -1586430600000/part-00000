Written by [[Gary Lachman|Gary Valentine]] and [[Debbie Harry]] for the band's self-titled debut album, ''[[Blondie (album)|Blondie]]'', the song was released as the album's [[lead single]] on [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] in June 1976.\n\n==Song information==\nThe title of the song was originally \"Sex Offender\". Bassist Gary Valentine originally wrote the song about an 18-year-old boy being arrested for having sex with his younger girlfriend. Debbie Harry changed the lyrics so that the song was about a prostitute being attracted to the police officer that had arrested her. The track was co-produced by [[Richard Gottehrer]] who had worked with 1960s girl group [[The Angels (American group)|The Angels]], and the song is reminiscent of that era in its style.\n\nPrivate Stock insisted that the name of the single be changed to \"X Offender\" because they were nervous about the original title. It was released in mid-1976 with the B-side being \"In the Sun\". While the song did not chart, [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] heard it along with the ''Blondie'' album and signed the band. \"X Offender\" later served as the B-side to \"[[Rip Her to Shreds]]\". Due to limited copies of the single being released and the subsequent popularity of the band, a copy of the original UK Private Stock single \"X Offender\"/\"In the Sun\" is a sought-after rarity with copies selling for \u00a3750 in collectors' markets since the mixes of both songs on the single are different from those on the ''[[Blondie (album)|Blondie]]'' album. These mixes appear as bonus tracks on [[EMI]]/[[Capitol Records]]' 2001 re-issue of the album. Unfortunately, no master tapes of the Private Stock versions have been kept in the archives; consequently, these bonus tracks are direct transfers from vinyl.\n\n==Music video==\nMusic videos were produced for both \"X Offender\" and \"In the Sun\".<ref>Che, Cathy (1999), 'Deborah Harry: Platinum Blonde', MPG Books Ltd, Cornwall, p.41</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n;US 7\" (PS-45.097)\n#\"X Offender\" (single version) ([[Gary Lachman|Gary Valentine]], [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]]) \u2013 3:15\n#\"In the Sun\" (single version) (Stein) \u2013 2:38\n* There were three pressings of this single that can only be distinguished by careful examination of the inscriptions in the vinyl.

Written by [[Gary Lachman|Gary Valentine]] and [[Debbie Harry]] for the band's self-titled debut album, ''[[Blondie (album)|Blondie]]'', the song was released as the album's [[lead single]] on [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] in June 1976.\n\n==Song information==\nThe title of the song was originally \"Sex Offender\". Bassist Gary Valentine originally wrote the song about an 18-year-old boy being arrested for having sex with his younger girlfriend. Debbie Harry changed the lyrics so that the song was about a prostitute being attracted to the police officer that had arrested her. The track was co-produced by [[Richard Gottehrer]] who had worked with 1960s girl group [[The Angels (American group)|The Angels]], and the song is reminiscent of that era in its style.\n\nPrivate Stock insisted that the name of the single be changed to \"X Offender\" because they were nervous about the original title. It was released in mid-1976 with the B-side being \"In the Sun\". While the song did not chart, [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] heard it along with the ''Blondie'' album and signed the band. \"X Offender\" later served as the B-side to \"[[Rip Her to Shreds]]\". Due to limited copies of the single being released and the subsequent popularity of the band, a copy of the original UK Private Stock single \"X Offender\"/\"In the Sun\" is a sought-after rarity with copies selling for \u00a3750 in collectors' markets since the mixes of both songs on the single are different from those on the ''[[Blondie (album)|Blondie]]'' album. These mixes appear as bonus tracks on [[EMI]]/[[Capitol Records]]' 2001 re-issue of the album. Unfortunately, no master tapes of the Private Stock versions have been kept in the archives; consequently, these bonus tracks are direct transfers from vinyl.\n\n==Music video==\nMusic videos were produced for both \"X Offender\" and \"In the Sun\".<ref>Che, Cathy (1999), 'Deborah Harry: Platinum Blonde', MPG Books Ltd, Cornwall, p.41</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n;US 7\" (PS-45.097)\n#\"X Offender\" (single version) ([[Gary Lachman|Gary Valentine]], [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]]) \u2013 3:15\n#\"In the Sun\" (single version) (Stein) \u2013 2:38\n* There were three pressings of this single that can only be distinguished by careful examination of the inscriptions in the vinyl.

Power comes from 4.7 L 90\u00b0 V8 delivering {{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Top speed is {{convert|289|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} and acceleration from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) happens in 4.9 seconds. The only transmission is a MC Auto Shift, 6-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] automatic. Wheels are 20 inch MC Design units. It premiered on 27 September 2012 at the [[2012 Paris Motor Show|Paris Motor Show]].\n\n==Specifications==\nThe architecture of the GranTurismo and GranCabrio derives from the M139 [[Automobile platform|platform]] of the [[Maserati Quattroporte V|fifth generation Quattroporte]], shortened about {{convert|{{#EXPR:306.4\u2212294.2round0}}|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the [[wheelbase]] and {{convert|{{#EXPR:114.2\u2212106.6round0}}|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the rear [[Overhang (automotive)|overhang]].\nLike on the Quattroporte the engine is pushed back beyond the front wheel's centerline, inside the wheelbase\u2014in the [[front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]]. This confers a 49%/51% front/rear [[weight distribution]] to automatic transmission cars. \"MC SportShift\" sequential transmission variants have a further rear-biased 47%/53% weight distribution, due to the gearbox mounted at the rear with the differential\u2014in the [[transaxle]] layout.\n\nThe chassis is made of stamped and boxed steel sections, and is complemented by two aluminium [[subframe]]s: one at the front supporting the engine and providing suspension attaching points, and a tubular one at the rear supporting both suspension and differential (or the entire transmission in [[transaxle]] cars). Structural body panels are steel, the bonnet is aluminium and the boot lid is a single [[sheet moulding compound]] piece.\n\nThe suspension system consists of [[Double wishbone|unequal length control arms]] with [[Forging|forged]] aluminium arms and cast aluminium uprights, [[coil spring]]s and [[anti-roll bar]]s on both axles. [[Shock absorber|Dampers]] are either fixed-rate and set up for handling or \"Skyhook\" [[Adaptive suspension|adaptive]]. The Skyhook system uses aluminium-bodied gas dampers, allowing automatic and continuous damping rate adjustment by means of [[proportioning valve]]s.\n\n===Engines===\nThe engines are from [[Ferrari F136 engine|Ferrari/Maserati F136 V8]] family.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type!!Power at rpm!!Torque at rpm!!Redline (rpm)\n|-\n|GranTurismo||2007\u20132019||{{convert|4244|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|405|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,100||{{convert|460|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,250\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranTurismo S||2008\u20132011||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|440|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|490|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750 ||7,500\n|-\n|2011\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750 ||7,500\n|-\n|GranTurismo S Automatic||2009\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|440|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|490|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranTurismo MC Stradale||2011\u20132013||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|2013\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport<ref name=\"autocar.co.uk\"/>||2012\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranCabrio||2010\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|440|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|490|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|2012\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8|| {{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranCabrio Sport||2011\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|2012\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|-\n|GranCabrio MC||2013\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|}\n\n===Transmissions===\nDepending on the model two transmission are available on the GranTurismo and GranCabrio: a conventional [[torque converter]] 6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] or a 6-speed automated manual gearbox.\n\nAs on the Quattroporte, the automatic transmission is a [[ZF 6HP26 transmission|6HP26 unit]] supplied by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]].\nThis transmission includes Auto Normal Mode, Auto Sport Mode, Auto ICE Mode and Manual Mode. Auto Normal mode shifts gears automatically at low rpm to achieve the most comfortable ride and at higher rpm when driving style becomes more sporty. Auto Sport Mode changes gears 40% faster than in Normal Mode, downshifts when lifting off as a corner approaches; then it activates the stability control, stiffening Skyhook suspension, and opening exhaust valves when engine is over 3,000 rpm (in the GranTurismo S Automatic). Auto ICE mode is for low-grip conditions; it reduces maximum torque at the wheel, prevents 1st gear starts, and only allows gear changes below 1,000 rpm.\n\nSequential robotised transmission includes Manual Normal and Manual Sport, Manual Sport with MC-Shift, Auto Normal, Auto Sport, Auto ICE modes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type\n|-\n|GranTurismo||2007\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranTurismo S||2008\u20132019||6-speed sequential robotic with twin dry-plate clutch and paddle shifter\n|-\n|GranTurismo S Automatic||2009\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranCabrio||2010\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranCabrio Sport||2011\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport<ref name=\"autocar.co.uk\"/>||2012\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic or 6-speed sequential robotic\n|}\n\n===Performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Acceleration 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62 mph) (seconds)!!400 metre!!1000 metre!!Top speed!!Acceleration 80\u2013120&nbsp;km/h (seconds)||Braking 100\u20130&nbsp;km/h (metre)\n|-\n|GranTurismo||2007\u20132019||5.2||13.4||23.9 seconds at {{convert|225|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|285|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.maserati.com/ | title = Model range technical specifications | accessdate = 2011-12-20 | work = maserati.com }}</ref>||3.7||35\n|-\n|GranTurismo S||2008\u20132012||4.9<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13||23 seconds at {{convert|234|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}|| {{convert|295|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||3.5||36\n|-\n|GranTurismo S Automatic||2009\u20132012||5<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13.2||23.3 seconds after {{convert|228|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|295|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||3.3||35\n|-\n|GranCabrio||2010\u20132019||5.2<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13.9||24.8 seconds at {{convert|227|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|283|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||3.3||35\n|-\n|GranCabrio Sport||2011\u20132019||5.0<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13.5||24 seconds || {{convert|285|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||-||35<ref name=\"maseratigrancabriosport.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.maseratigrancabriosport.com/ |title=Technical data|accessdate=2011-06-29|work=maseratigrancabriosport.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|GranTurismo MC Stradale||2011\u20132019||4.5<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||12.5{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}||?|| {{convert|303|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||?||!\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport||2012\u20132019||4.7||12.5||?||{{convert|301|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||?||\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport (automatic)||2012\u20132019||4.8||12.6||?||{{convert|300|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||?||\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category multi|Maserati GranTurismo|Maserati GranCabrio}}\n* Pininfarina pages: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070305172012/http://www.pininfarina.com/index/storiaModelli/ultimi/GranTurismo.html Maserati GranTurismo], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090914153402/http://www.pininfarina.com/index/storiaModelli/ultimi/Maserati-GranCabrio.html Maserati GranCabrio]\n*Maserati pages: [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranCabrio.html GC], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranCabrio-Sport.html GCS], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo.html GT], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo-S.html GTS], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/granturismo-s-automatic.html GTSA], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo-Sport.html GT Sport], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/maseraticorse/granturismo_mc.html GTMC], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo-MC-Stradale.html GTMCS], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/Concept-Car/GranTurismo-MC-Concept.html GTMCC]\n* [https://archive.is/20130119181219/http://www.covercars.com/news/34980/covercarscom-car-of-the-year-2010 Maserati GranCabrio Car of the Year 2010]\n\n{{Maserati}}\n{{Maserati timeline}}\n\n[[Category:Maserati vehicles|GranTurismo]]\n[[Category:Grand tourers]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Maserati GranTurismo\n| image        = Maserati GranTurismo -

The strictly two-seat MC Stradale is more powerful than the GranTurismo at {{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, friction reduction accounts for the increase, says Maserati, due to the strategic use of \u201cdiamond-like coating\", an antifriction technology derived from Formula 1, on wear parts such as the cams and followers. It is also 110&nbsp;kg lighter (1,670&nbsp;kg dry weight) from the GranTurismo, and more aerodynamic than any previous GranTurismo model - all with the same fuel consumption as the regular GranTurismo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/09/22/maserati-granturismo-mc-stradale/|title=Maserati\u2019s New GranTurismo MC Stradale|publisher=Automoblog.net}}</ref> In addition to two air intakes in the bonnet, the MC Stradale also receives a new front splitter and rear air dam for better aerodynamics, downforce, and improved cooling of carbon ceramic brakes and engine.

[[Pirelli]] has custom-designed extra-wide 20-inch P Zero Corsa tyres to fit new flow-formed alloy wheels.\n\nThe Brembo braking system with carbon ceramic discs weighs around 60% less than the traditional system with steel discs. The front is equipped with 380 x 34&nbsp;mm ventilated discs, operated by a 6 piston caliper. The rear discs measure 360 x 32&nbsp;mm with four piston calipers.

Power comes from 4.7 L 90\u00b0 V8 delivering {{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Top speed is {{convert|289|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} and acceleration from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) happens in 4.9 seconds. The only transmission is a MC Auto Shift, 6-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] automatic. Wheels are 20 inch MC Design units. It premiered on 27 September 2012 at the [[2012 Paris Motor Show|Paris Motor Show]].\n\n==Specifications==\nThe architecture of the GranTurismo and GranCabrio derives from the M139 [[Automobile platform|platform]] of the [[Maserati Quattroporte V|fifth generation Quattroporte]], shortened about {{convert|{{#EXPR:306.4\u2212294.2round0}}|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the [[wheelbase]] and {{convert|{{#EXPR:114.2\u2212106.6round0}}|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the rear [[Overhang (automotive)|overhang]].\nLike on the Quattroporte the engine is pushed back beyond the front wheel's centerline, inside the wheelbase\u2014in the [[front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]]. This confers a 49%/51% front/rear [[weight distribution]] to automatic transmission cars. \"MC SportShift\" sequential transmission variants have a further rear-biased 47%/53% weight distribution, due to the gearbox mounted at the rear with the differential\u2014in the [[transaxle]] layout.\n\nThe chassis is made of stamped and boxed steel sections, and is complemented by two aluminium [[subframe]]s: one at the front supporting the engine and providing suspension attaching points, and a tubular one at the rear supporting both suspension and differential (or the entire transmission in [[transaxle]] cars). Structural body panels are steel, the bonnet is aluminium and the boot lid is a single [[sheet moulding compound]] piece.\n\nThe suspension system consists of [[Double wishbone|unequal length control arms]] with [[Forging|forged]] aluminium arms and cast aluminium uprights, [[coil spring]]s and [[anti-roll bar]]s on both axles. [[Shock absorber|Dampers]] are either fixed-rate and set up for handling or \"Skyhook\" [[Adaptive suspension|adaptive]]. The Skyhook system uses aluminium-bodied gas dampers, allowing automatic and continuous damping rate adjustment by means of [[proportioning valve]]s.\n\n===Engines===\nThe engines are from [[Ferrari F136 engine|Ferrari/Maserati F136 V8]] family.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type!!Power at rpm!!Torque at rpm!!Redline (rpm)\n|-\n|GranTurismo||2007\u20132019||{{convert|4244|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|405|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,100||{{convert|460|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,250\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranTurismo S||2008\u20132011||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|440|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|490|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750 ||7,500\n|-\n|2011\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750 ||7,500\n|-\n|GranTurismo S Automatic||2009\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|440|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|490|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranTurismo MC Stradale||2011\u20132013||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|2013\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport<ref name=\"autocar.co.uk\"/>||2012\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranCabrio||2010\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|440|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|490|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|2012\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8|| {{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|rowspan=2|GranCabrio Sport||2011\u20132012||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|510|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,200\n|-\n|2012\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|-\n|GranCabrio MC||2013\u20132019||{{convert|4691|cc|cuin||abbr=on}} 90\u00b0 V8||{{convert|460|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000||{{convert|520|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750||7,500\n|}\n\n===Transmissions===\nDepending on the model two transmission are available on the GranTurismo and GranCabrio: a conventional [[torque converter]] 6-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] or a 6-speed automated manual gearbox.\n\nAs on the Quattroporte, the automatic transmission is a [[ZF 6HP26 transmission|6HP26 unit]] supplied by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]].\nThis transmission includes Auto Normal Mode, Auto Sport Mode, Auto ICE Mode and Manual Mode. Auto Normal mode shifts gears automatically at low rpm to achieve the most comfortable ride and at higher rpm when driving style becomes more sporty. Auto Sport Mode changes gears 40% faster than in Normal Mode, downshifts when lifting off as a corner approaches; then it activates the stability control, stiffening Skyhook suspension, and opening exhaust valves when engine is over 3,000 rpm (in the GranTurismo S Automatic). Auto ICE mode is for low-grip conditions; it reduces maximum torque at the wheel, prevents 1st gear starts, and only allows gear changes below 1,000 rpm.\n\nSequential robotised transmission includes Manual Normal and Manual Sport, Manual Sport with MC-Shift, Auto Normal, Auto Sport, Auto ICE modes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Type\n|-\n|GranTurismo||2007\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranTurismo S||2008\u20132019||6-speed sequential robotic with twin dry-plate clutch and paddle shifter\n|-\n|GranTurismo S Automatic||2009\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranCabrio||2010\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranCabrio Sport||2011\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport<ref name=\"autocar.co.uk\"/>||2012\u20132019||ZF 6-speed automatic or 6-speed sequential robotic\n|}\n\n===Performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model!!Years!!Acceleration 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62 mph) (seconds)!!400 metre!!1000 metre!!Top speed!!Acceleration 80\u2013120&nbsp;km/h (seconds)||Braking 100\u20130&nbsp;km/h (metre)\n|-\n|GranTurismo||2007\u20132019||5.2||13.4||23.9 seconds at {{convert|225|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|285|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.maserati.com/ | title = Model range technical specifications | accessdate = 2011-12-20 | work = maserati.com }}</ref>||3.7||35\n|-\n|GranTurismo S||2008\u20132012||4.9<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13||23 seconds at {{convert|234|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}|| {{convert|295|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||3.5||36\n|-\n|GranTurismo S Automatic||2009\u20132012||5<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13.2||23.3 seconds after {{convert|228|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|295|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||3.3||35\n|-\n|GranCabrio||2010\u20132019||5.2<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13.9||24.8 seconds at {{convert|227|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|283|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||3.3||35\n|-\n|GranCabrio Sport||2011\u20132019||5.0<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||13.5||24 seconds || {{convert|285|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||-||35<ref name=\"maseratigrancabriosport.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.maseratigrancabriosport.com/ |title=Technical data|accessdate=2011-06-29|work=maseratigrancabriosport.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|GranTurismo MC Stradale||2011\u20132019||4.5<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/>||12.5{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}||?|| {{convert|303|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"maserati.com\"/> ||?||!\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport||2012\u20132019||4.7||12.5||?||{{convert|301|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||?||\n|-\n|GranTurismo Sport (automatic)||2012\u20132019||4.8||12.6||?||{{convert|300|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}||?||\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category multi|Maserati GranTurismo|Maserati GranCabrio}}\n* Pininfarina pages: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070305172012/http://www.pininfarina.com/index/storiaModelli/ultimi/GranTurismo.html Maserati GranTurismo], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090914153402/http://www.pininfarina.com/index/storiaModelli/ultimi/Maserati-GranCabrio.html Maserati GranCabrio]\n*Maserati pages: [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranCabrio.html GC], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranCabrio-Sport.html GCS], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo.html GT], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo-S.html GTS], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/granturismo-s-automatic.html GTSA], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo-Sport.html GT Sport], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/maseraticorse/granturismo_mc.html GTMC], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/GranTurismo-MC-Stradale.html GTMCS], [http://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/Concept-Car/GranTurismo-MC-Concept.html GTMCC]\n* [https://archive.is/20130119181219/http://www.covercars.com/news/34980/covercarscom-car-of-the-year-2010 Maserati GranCabrio Car of the Year 2010]\n\n{{Maserati}}\n{{Maserati timeline}}\n\n[[Category:Maserati vehicles|GranTurismo]]\n[[Category:Grand tourers]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGranTurismo MC Stradale (2011\u20132019):Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2011-2013 \u2192 2011\u20132013", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati_GranTurismo"}
