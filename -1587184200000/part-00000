The ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' (UN), led by [[Daniel Johnson, Sr]], defeated the incumbent [[Quebec Liberal Party]], led by [[Jean Lesage]].\n\nIn terms of the number of seats won, the election was one of the closest in recent history, with the UN winning 56 seats to the Liberals' 50.  Generally, Quebec's [[first past the post]] electoral system tends to produce strong disparities in the number of seats won even if the popular vote is fairly close.  The Liberals won 6.5% more votes, but were denied a third term because rural areas were slightly overrepresented in the legislature.\n\nThe victory of the UN over the popular Lesage government was a surprise to many observers. Johnson's campaign was likely helped by his position that Quebec should get a better deal within the Canadian confederation, or should separate if it is unable to do so. In this sense, the forces of [[Quebec nationalism]] unleashed by the [[Quiet Revolution]] begun by Lesage may have contributed to his defeat, as many rural voters felt chagrin at the rapid pace of reform under the Liberals.\n\nThe pro-independence ''[[Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale]]'' and ''[[Ralliement national]]'' obtained a combined total of just under 9% of the popular vote (but no seats).\n\nThis was the last election for the \"Legislative Assembly of Quebec\".

The ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'' (UN), led by [[Daniel Johnson, Sr]], defeated the incumbent [[Quebec Liberal Party]], led by [[Jean Lesage]].\n\nIn terms of the number of seats won, the election was one of the closest in recent history, with the UN winning 56 seats to the Liberals' 50.  Generally, Quebec's [[first past the post]] electoral system tends to produce strong disparities in the number of seats won even if the popular vote is fairly close.  The Liberals won 6.5% more votes, but were denied a third term because rural areas were slightly overrepresented in the legislature.\n\nThe victory of the UN over the popular Lesage government was a surprise to many observers. Johnson's campaign was likely helped by his position that Quebec should get a better deal within the Canadian confederation, or should separate if it is unable to do so. In this sense, the forces of [[Quebec nationalism]] unleashed by the [[Quiet Revolution]] begun by Lesage may have contributed to his defeat, as many rural voters felt chagrin at the rapid pace of reform under the Liberals.\n\nThe pro-independence ''[[Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale]]'' and ''[[Ralliement national]]'' obtained a combined total of just under 9% of the popular vote (but no seats).\n\nThis was the last election for the \"Legislative Assembly of Quebec\". Legislation was passed to replace the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] system of Legislative Assembly and [[Legislative Council of Quebec]] with a single [[National Assembly of Quebec]], effective December 31, 1968.\n\nDaniel Johnson died in office in 1968, and was succeeded by [[Jean-Jacques Bertrand]].

The 2004 final featured the first [[red card (sports)|red card]] in MLS Cup history, awarded for a handball which resulted in a [[penalty kick]] for Kansas City's second goal. It was D.C.

It was contested between [[D.C. United]] and the [[Kansas City Wizards]] to decide the champion of the [[2004 Major League Soccer season|2004 season]]. The two teams had qualified for the playoffs after seasons with mixed results that ended in top-two finishes in their respective conferences.\n\nD.C. United won the match 3\u20132, scoring all three of its goals in a seven-minute span during the first half after the Wizards had taken an early lead.

The 2004 final featured the first [[red card (sports)|red card]] in MLS Cup history, awarded for a handball which resulted in a [[penalty kick]] for Kansas City's second goal. It was D.C. United's fourth MLS Cup title and their first since [[MLS Cup 1999|1999]], and manager [[Peter Nowak]] became the first person to win the MLS Cup as a player and coach.\n\n==Venue==\n\nThe [[Home Depot Center]] in [[Carson, California]], the home venue of the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], was announced by the league as the host of MLS Cup 2004 on June 23, 2004.

Her husband was the famous but ill-fated arctic explorer Sir John Franklin, who from 1837 to 1843 was the sixth Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). At a time when women were meant to stay in the domestic sphere Jane, Lady Franklin held lectures and evening parties with intellectual conversation.

Situated almost in the middle between the University of Tasmania\u2019s Sandy Bay and city campuses, Jane is a 30 minute walk or short bus ride on the Jane Bus to all university sites<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medstudentsonline.com.au/forum/threads/utas-accommodation-options.33247/|title=UTAS Accommodation Options|website=Med Students Online|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>.\n\n==Campus==\n'''Aldridge''' \u2013 A 1970s style building covered in lush Virginia creeper, Aldridge is the first building off Elboden Street. It is named after a large home owned by the Allport family that used to grace its grounds. The College\u2019s office is on the bottom floor of Aldridge, and the rest of the building is made up of student rooms. \n\n'''Michael Webber House''' \u2013 Named after a respected, long serving member of the College Council, \u2018Webber\u2019 is one of the few Hobart houses built in the Arts and Crafts architectural style of the early 1900s. It contains the Edwin Pitman Common Room (known as the \u201cEddy P\u201d) and ten large bedrooms. Webber is occupied by selected senior students who may prefer to self-cater.\n\n'''Horton''' \u2013 The second building along the driveway, Horton houses approximately 40 residents, the Horton Common Room (known as \u201cthe H\u201d),College laundry, weights room and a kitchen for weekend baking hobbies. \n\n'''Asten''' \u2013 Asten is the home of the Kitchen and Dining Hall, Student Club Committee office and approximately 52 residents.\n\n'''Barrett''' \u2013 Originally called \u2018Clothea\u2019, Barrett is a gracious 1880s Victorian home where the first students of Jane lived. It is named after a College founder, Archdeacon Barrett. The high vaulted ceilings and seven larger rooms are typically allocated by academic merit and community contribution. Barrett is home to the senior common room, Reflection Room and the link room, containing a full sized grand piano. It also houses COMA, an extensive collection of medical memorabilia, run as its own entity. \n\n'''Vines''' \u2013 Built in the 1950s, Vines is the first dedicated College development of Jane Franklin Hall. Vines is named after former Principal Miss Kirsty Vines. It has its own 1950s quirks, most notably the shorter beds, installed when people were shorter and the College was all women. The college library and approximately 26 students are located in Vines, which is opposite the bus stop.\n\n'''Fleming''' - A smaller area of the College, Fleming is named after former Principal, Miss Ruth Fleming. The wing is made up of seven rooms with ensuite bathrooms.  On the top floor is the Coffee Lounge, converted from a former College laundry. It is used for quiet study or recreation. \n\n===Other buildings===\n'''The Frances Parsons Building''' \u2013 The Franny P hosts tutorials, play and band rehearsals, social functions and various other events.  It is named in honour of founding student of the College, Ms Frances Parsons, who later became the first alumna appointed as Principal of the College. The Franny P overlooks the tennis court and has views of Sandy Bay and the Derwent River. \n\n'''The Lodge''' \u2013 Formerly the home of successive College Principals,   the Lodge is a large, three story home now available a self catered option for selected senior students. It has views of Sandy Bay and the River Derwent. \n\n'''The Fenton wing'''- Named in honour of Fellow of the College, Dr Karla Fenton OAM, this is the most recent addition to Jane, linking Horton and Aldridge. It features three self-contained apartments for post graduate students. \n\n'''The Grounds''' \u2013 The grounds include maintained lawns and gardens.  Pre-dinner drinks are served on the main lawn after the Commencement Ceremony.  [[Backyard cricket]] is regularly played on the main lawn during the cricket season, and a barbecue is available for use.\n\n==Academic support==\nAll residents have access to an in-house academic support programme which provides subject tutorials in addition to those regular to a university course.  Access to study facilities is provided throughout the semester and during the period just prior to and throughout the university examination period the college enters [[Revision week|swot vac]].  This quiet time requires residents to be particularly mindful of their noise levels so that all residents are able to study.\n\n==Student life==\nUpon entry to Jane, all residents become members of the Jane Franklin Hall Student Club.  Residents can accept nomination to a position on the Student Club Committee and/or various sub-committees by election, and are then charged with representing students or organising activities.\n\n===Extra-curricular sports and activities===\nThe following sports and activities are played between Jane Franklin Hall, [[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|Christ College]] and [[St. John Fisher College (University of Tasmania)|John Fisher College]] in an intercollege sports competition: Rugby, Tennis, Table Tennis, Volleyball, Softball, Cricket, Netball, Australian Rules football, Soccer, Basketball and Debating.\n\nAs well as the intercollege sports, the College holds annual theatrical productions, student art exhibitions, music soirees and competitions, and philosophy and religion discussion groups.\n\n===Food and meals===\nThe College provides three meals a day, seven days a week, with an extra afternoon tea and supper provided each day of the SwotVac and exam periods. \n\nEach Monday of the semester, students don academic gowns for a three-course meal complete with candelabra and the wearing of College ties or brooches. The Principal hosts staff and special guests at the high table, grace is said - often in Latin - and a member of College acknowledges the traditional owners of the land, the Mouheneener people. \n\nIn 2018, the College resumed management of the kitchen, having engaged an external catering company for a number of years. The College now employs its own Catering Manager and staff.\n\n===Wellbeing at Jane===\n====On campus====\n* Principal \u2013 oversees all aspects of pastoral support and management of residents\u2019 welfare.\n* Dean of Students \u2013 oversees resident staff and assists the principal with the management of residents\u2019 welfare.\n* Senior Residents \u2013 a Senior Resident (SR) is a postgraduate or senior student available at all times that the Office is closed and is trained in various support skills including first aid, mental health, harassment and discrimination awareness, crisis management, conflict resolution and study skills.\n\n====Off campus====\n* Fellows \u2013 Fellows are members of the Jane community who are available to residents, particularly during College functions, and assist with mentoring and career guidance.

It also houses COMA, an extensive collection of medical memorabilia, run as its own entity. \n\n'''Vines''' \u2013 Built in the 1950s, Vines is the first dedicated College development of Jane Franklin Hall. Vines is named after former Principal Miss Kirsty Vines. It has its own 1950s quirks, most notably the shorter beds, installed when people were shorter and the College was all women. The college library and approximately 26 students are located in Vines, which is opposite the bus stop.\n\n'''Fleming''' - A smaller area of the College, Fleming is named after former Principal, Miss Ruth Fleming. The wing is made up of seven rooms with ensuite bathrooms.  On the top floor is the Coffee Lounge, converted from a former College laundry. It is used for quiet study or recreation. \n\n===Other buildings===\n'''The Frances Parsons Building''' \u2013 The Franny P hosts tutorials, play and band rehearsals, social functions and various other events.  It is named in honour of founding student of the College, Ms Frances Parsons, who later became the first alumna appointed as Principal of the College. The Franny P overlooks the tennis court and has views of Sandy Bay and the Derwent River. \n\n'''The Lodge''' \u2013 Formerly the home of successive College Principals,   the Lodge is a large, three story home now available a self catered option for selected senior students. It has views of Sandy Bay and the River Derwent. \n\n'''The Fenton wing'''- Named in honour of Fellow of the College, Dr Karla Fenton OAM, this is the most recent addition to Jane, linking Horton and Aldridge. It features three self-contained apartments for post graduate students. \n\n'''The Grounds''' \u2013 The grounds include maintained lawns and gardens.  Pre-dinner drinks are served on the main lawn after the Commencement Ceremony.  [[Backyard cricket]] is regularly played on the main lawn during the cricket season, and a barbecue is available for use.\n\n==Academic support==\nAll residents have access to an in-house academic support programme which provides subject tutorials in addition to those regular to a university course.  Access to study facilities is provided throughout the semester and during the period just prior to and throughout the university examination period the college enters [[Revision week|swot vac]].  This quiet time requires residents to be particularly mindful of their noise levels so that all residents are able to study.\n\n==Student life==\nUpon entry to Jane, all residents become members of the Jane Franklin Hall Student Club.  Residents can accept nomination to a position on the Student Club Committee and/or various sub-committees by election, and are then charged with representing students or organising activities.\n\n===Extra-curricular sports and activities===\nThe following sports and activities are played between Jane Franklin Hall, [[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|Christ College]] and [[St. John Fisher College (University of Tasmania)|John Fisher College]] in an intercollege sports competition: Rugby, Tennis, Table Tennis, Volleyball, Softball, Cricket, Netball, Australian Rules football, Soccer, Basketball and Debating.\n\nAs well as the intercollege sports, the College holds annual theatrical productions, student art exhibitions, music soirees and competitions, and philosophy and religion discussion groups.\n\n===Food and meals===\nThe College provides three meals a day, seven days a week, with an extra afternoon tea and supper provided each day of the SwotVac and exam periods. \n\nEach Monday of the semester, students don academic gowns for a three-course meal complete with candelabra and the wearing of College ties or brooches. The Principal hosts staff and special guests at the high table, grace is said - often in Latin - and a member of College acknowledges the traditional owners of the land, the Mouheneener people. \n\nIn 2018, the College resumed management of the kitchen, having engaged an external catering company for a number of years. The College now employs its own Catering Manager and staff.\n\n===Wellbeing at Jane===\n====On campus====\n* Principal \u2013 oversees all aspects of pastoral support and management of residents\u2019 welfare.\n* Dean of Students \u2013 oversees resident staff and assists the principal with the management of residents\u2019 welfare.\n* Senior Residents \u2013 a Senior Resident (SR) is a postgraduate or senior student available at all times that the Office is closed and is trained in various support skills including first aid, mental health, harassment and discrimination awareness, crisis management, conflict resolution and study skills.\n\n====Off campus====\n* Fellows \u2013 Fellows are members of the Jane community who are available to residents, particularly during College functions, and assist with mentoring and career guidance.  There are approximately 40 Fellows representing most disciplines of the university.\n* Chaplains \u2013 several chaplains from various Christian faiths are available to residents for confidential support and counselling on an opt-in, opt-out basis.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n* [[George Bailey (cricketer, born 1982)|George Bailey]] \u2013 Test cricketer, captain of Australian T20 team and member of Australian ODI team\n* [[David Bushby]] \u2013 Australian Consul-General in Chicago and former Chief Government Whip in the Senate\n* [[Enid Campbell]] \u2013 Legal scholar, first female law professor and law school dean in Australasia \n* [[Jonathon Duniam]] \u2013 Liberal Senator\n* [[Marilyn Lake]] \u2013 Australian historian \n* [[Tim McCormack]] \u2013 Dean of Law at the [[University of Tasmania]] and international humanitarian law academic\n* [[Denise Swan]] \u2013 former Liberal politician and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania \n* [[Felix J.

These divisions do not necessarily represent ethnic sub-divisions within the larger ethnic group:\n\n*''[[Naskapi]]'' and ''[[Innu people|Montagnais]]'' (together known as the ''[[Innu]]'') are inhabitants of an area they refer to as [[Nitassinan]].  Their territories comprise most of the present-day political jurisdictions of eastern [[Quebec]] and [[Labrador]]. Their cultures are differentiated, as some of the Naskapi are still [[caribou]] hunters and more nomadic than many of the Montagnais. The Montagnais have more settlements.  The total population of the two groups in 2003 was about 18,000 people, of which 15,000 lived in Quebec. Their dialects and languages are the most distinct from the Cree spoken by the groups west of Lake Superior.\n*[[Atikamekw]] are inhabitants of the area they refer to as [[Nitaskinan]] (Our Land), in the upper St. Maurice River valley of Quebec (about 300&nbsp;km north of [[Montreal]]). Their population is around 4,500.\n*[[East Cree]] \u2013 [[Grand Council of the Crees]]; approximately 18,000 Cree (''Iyyu'' in Coastal Dialect / ''[[Iynu]]'' in Inland Dialect) of [[Eeyou Istchee (territory)|Eeyou Istchee]] and [[Nunavik]] regions of Northern Quebec.<ref>{{cite web |title=Les Am\u00e9rindiens du Canada |trans-title=Amerindians of Canada |language=French |publisher=Authentik Canada |url=https://www.authentikcanada.com/les-amerindiens}}</ref>\n*''[[Moose Cree]]'' \u2013 [[Moose Factory, Ontario|Moose Factory]]<ref name=\"moosecree.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moosecree.com/community-profile/services.html |title=Moose Cree First Nation community profile |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210012321/http://www.moosecree.com/community-profile/services.html |archive-date=10 December 2008}}</ref> in the [[Cochrane District]], [[Ontario]]; this group lives on [[Moose Factory Island]], near the mouth of the [[Moose River (Ontario)|Moose River]], at the southern end of James Bay.

Some also live in eastern Saskatchewan around [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan|Cumberland House]]. It has 4,500 speakers.\n*''[[Woods Cree]]'' \u2013 a group in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n*''[[Plains Cree]]'' \u2013 a total of 34,000 people in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Montana.\n\nDue to the many dialects of the [[Cree language]], the people have no modern collective [[Endonym|autonym]]. The Plains Cree and Attikamekw refer to themselves using modern forms of the historical ''n\u00eahiraw'', namely ''n\u00eahiyaw'' and ''n\u00eahirawisiw'', respectively. Moose Cree, East Cree, Naskapi, and Montagnais all refer to themselves using modern dialectal forms of the historical ''iriniw'', meaning 'man.' Moose Cree use the form ''ililiw'', coastal East Cree and Naskapi use ''iyiyiw'' (variously spelled ''iiyiyiu'', ''iiyiyuu'', and ''eeyou''), inland East Cree use ''iyiniw'' (variously spelled ''iinuu'' and ''eenou''), and Montagnais use ''ilnu'' and ''innu'', depending on dialect. The Cree use \"Cree,\" \"cri,\" \"Naskapi, or \"montagnais\" to refer to their people only when speaking [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]].<ref name=Pentland>{{cite book |quote=David H.

In the case of disagreement, lodges could leave bands and bands could be formed and dissolved with relative ease. However, as there is safety in numbers, all families would want to be part of some band, and banishment was considered a very serious punishment.  Bands would usually have strong ties to their neighbours through intermarriage and would assemble together at different parts of the year to hunt and socialize together.  Besides these regional gatherings, there was no higher-level formal structure, and decisions of war and peace were made by consensus with allied bands meeting together in council.  People could be identified by their ''clan'', which is a group of people claiming descent from the same common ancestor; each clan would have a representative and a vote in all important councils held by the band (compare: [[Anishinaabe clan system]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johncochrane.ca/drupal/node/84|title=Traditional Cree Nation Custom Council|date=30 October 2012|first=Jon|last=Dorian|website=Kaministikominahiko-skak Cree Nation}}</ref>\n\nEach band remained independent of each other. However, Cree-speaking bands tended to work together and with their neighbours against outside enemies.  Those Cree who moved onto the [[Great Plains]] and adopted [[bison hunting]], called the Plains Cree, were allied with the [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] and the [[Saulteaux]] in what was known as the \"[[Iron Confederacy]]\", which was a major force in the [[North American fur trade]] from the 1730s to the 1870s. The Cree and the Assiniboine were important intermediaries in the [[Great Plains Indian Trading Networks before Lewis and Clark|Indian trading networks]] on the northern plains.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nWhen a band went to war, they would nominate a temporary military commander, called a ''okimahkan''. loosely translated as \"war chief\".  This office was different from that of the \"peace chief\", a leader who had a role more like that of diplomat. In the run-up to the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion]], [[Big Bear]] was the leader of his band, but once the fighting started [[Wandering Spirit (Cree leader)|Wandering Spirit]] became war leader.

In the West, mixed bands of Cree, Saulteaux and Assiniboine, all partners in the [[Iron Confederacy]], are the norm. However, in recent years, as indigenous languages have declined across western Canada where there were once three languages spoken on a given reserve, there may now only be one. This has led to a simplification of identity, and it has become \"fashionable\" for bands in many parts of Saskatchewan to identify as \"Plains Cree\" at the expense of a mixed Cree-Salteaux history. There is also a tendency for bands to recategorize themselves as \"Plains Cree\" instead of Woods Cree or Swampy Cree. Neal McLeod argues this is partly due to the dominant culture's fascination with [[Plains Indian]] culture as well as the greater degree of written [[standardization (linguistics)|standardization]] and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige]] Plains Cree enjoys over other Cree dialects.<ref name=\"brandonu\" />\n\nThe [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The M\u00e9tis |website=Canada's First People |access-date=27 October 2019 |url=http://firstpeoplesofcanada.com/fp_metis/fp_metis1.html}}</ref> (from the French, ''M\u00e9tis'' - of mixed ancestry) are people of mixed ancestry, such as Nehiyaw (or Anishinaabe) and [[French people|French]], [[English people|English]], or [[Scottish people|Scottish]] heritage.

These divisions do not necessarily represent ethnic sub-divisions within the larger ethnic group:\n\n*''[[Naskapi]]'' and ''[[Innu people|Montagnais]]'' (together known as the ''[[Innu]]'') are inhabitants of an area they refer to as [[Nitassinan]].  Their territories comprise most of the present-day political jurisdictions of eastern [[Quebec]] and [[Labrador]]. Their cultures are differentiated, as some of the Naskapi are still [[caribou]] hunters and more nomadic than many of the Montagnais. The Montagnais have more settlements.  The total population of the two groups in 2003 was about 18,000 people, of which 15,000 lived in Quebec. Their dialects and languages are the most distinct from the Cree spoken by the groups west of Lake Superior.\n*[[Atikamekw]] are inhabitants of the area they refer to as [[Nitaskinan]] (Our Land), in the upper St. Maurice River valley of Quebec (about 300&nbsp;km north of [[Montreal]]). Their population is around 4,500.\n*[[East Cree]] \u2013 [[Grand Council of the Crees]]; approximately 18,000 Cree (''Iyyu'' in Coastal Dialect / ''[[Iynu]]'' in Inland Dialect) of [[Eeyou Istchee (territory)|Eeyou Istchee]] and [[Nunavik]] regions of Northern Quebec.<ref>{{cite web |title=Les Am\u00e9rindiens du Canada |trans-title=Amerindians of Canada |language=French |publisher=Authentik Canada |url=https://www.authentikcanada.com/les-amerindiens}}</ref>\n*''[[Moose Cree]]'' \u2013 [[Moose Factory, Ontario|Moose Factory]]<ref name=\"moosecree.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moosecree.com/community-profile/services.html |title=Moose Cree First Nation community profile |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210012321/http://www.moosecree.com/community-profile/services.html |archive-date=10 December 2008}}</ref> in the [[Cochrane District]], [[Ontario]]; this group lives on [[Moose Factory Island]], near the mouth of the [[Moose River (Ontario)|Moose River]], at the southern end of James Bay.

The Plains Cree and Attikamekw refer to themselves using modern forms of the historical ''n\u00eahiraw'', namely ''n\u00eahiyaw'' and ''n\u00eahirawisiw'', respectively. Moose Cree, East Cree, Naskapi, and Montagnais all refer to themselves using modern dialectal forms of the historical ''iriniw'', meaning 'man.' Moose Cree use the form ''ililiw'', coastal East Cree and Naskapi use ''iyiyiw'' (variously spelled ''iiyiyiu'', ''iiyiyuu'', and ''eeyou''), inland East Cree use ''iyiniw'' (variously spelled ''iinuu'' and ''eenou''), and Montagnais use ''ilnu'' and ''innu'', depending on dialect. The Cree use \"Cree,\" \"cri,\" \"Naskapi, or \"montagnais\" to refer to their people only when speaking [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]].<ref name=Pentland>{{cite book |quote=David H.

In the case of disagreement, lodges could leave bands and bands could be formed and dissolved with relative ease. However, as there is safety in numbers, all families would want to be part of some band, and banishment was considered a very serious punishment.  Bands would usually have strong ties to their neighbours through intermarriage and would assemble together at different parts of the year to hunt and socialize together.  Besides these regional gatherings, there was no higher-level formal structure, and decisions of war and peace were made by consensus with allied bands meeting together in council.  People could be identified by their ''clan'', which is a group of people claiming descent from the same common ancestor; each clan would have a representative and a vote in all important councils held by the band (compare: [[Anishinaabe clan system]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johncochrane.ca/drupal/node/84|title=Traditional Cree Nation Custom Council|date=30 October 2012|first=Jon|last=Dorian|website=Kaministikominahiko-skak Cree Nation}}</ref>\n\nEach band remained independent of each other. However, Cree-speaking bands tended to work together and with their neighbours against outside enemies.  Those Cree who moved onto the [[Great Plains]] and adopted [[bison hunting]], called the Plains Cree, were allied with the [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] and the [[Saulteaux]] in what was known as the \"[[Iron Confederacy]]\", which was a major force in the [[North American fur trade]] from the 1730s to the 1870s. The Cree and the Assiniboine were important intermediaries in the [[Great Plains Indian Trading Networks before Lewis and Clark|Indian trading networks]] on the northern plains.<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nWhen a band went to war, they would nominate a temporary military commander, called a ''okimahkan''. loosely translated as \"war chief\".  This office was different from that of the \"peace chief\", a leader who had a role more like that of diplomat. In the run-up to the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion]], [[Big Bear]] was the leader of his band, but once the fighting started [[Wandering Spirit (Cree leader)|Wandering Spirit]] became war leader.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nThere have been several attempts to create a national political organization that would represent all Cree peoples, at least as far back as a 1994 gathering at the Opaskwayak Cree First Nation reserve.<ref name=\"brandonu\">{{cite journal |last=Maclead |first=Neal |title=Plains Cree Identity: Borderlands, Ambiguous Genealogies and Narratives Irony |journal=Canadian Journal of Native Studies |volume=20 |issue=2|date=2000|pages=437\u2013454 |url=http://www3.brandonu.ca/cjns/20.2/cjnsv20no1_pg437-454.pdf |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191458/http://www3.brandonu.ca/cjns/20.2/cjnsv20no1_pg437-454.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe name \"Cree\" is derived from the [[Algonkian languages|Algonkian]]-language [[exonym]] ''Kiri\u0161tino\u02d9'', which the [[Ojibwa]] used for tribes around [[Hudson Bay]].

Yet in other dialects, the distinction between {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} (\u0113) and {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (\u012b) has been lost, merging to the latter.  In more western dialects, the distinction between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} (\u0161) has been lost, both merging to the former. \"Cree is a not a typologically harmonic language.

In the West, mixed bands of Cree, Saulteaux and Assiniboine, all partners in the [[Iron Confederacy]], are the norm. However, in recent years, as indigenous languages have declined across western Canada where there were once three languages spoken on a given reserve, there may now only be one. This has led to a simplification of identity, and it has become \"fashionable\" for bands in many parts of Saskatchewan to identify as \"Plains Cree\" at the expense of a mixed Cree-Salteaux history. There is also a tendency for bands to recategorize themselves as \"Plains Cree\" instead of Woods Cree or Swampy Cree. Neal McLeod argues this is partly due to the dominant culture's fascination with [[Plains Indian]] culture as well as the greater degree of written [[standardization (linguistics)|standardization]] and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige]] Plains Cree enjoys over other Cree dialects.<ref name=\"brandonu\" />\n\nThe [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The M\u00e9tis |website=Canada's First People |access-date=27 October 2019 |url=http://firstpeoplesofcanada.com/fp_metis/fp_metis1.html}}</ref> (from the French, ''M\u00e9tis'' - of mixed ancestry) are people of mixed ancestry, such as Nehiyaw (or Anishinaabe) and [[French people|French]], [[English people|English]], or [[Scottish people|Scottish]] heritage.

Retrieved on 6 March 2007.</ref>\n\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] ceded Hong Kong to the [[British Empire]] in 1842 through the [[treaty of Nanjing]], ending the [[First Opium War]]. Hong Kong then became a British [[crown colony]]. Britain also won the [[Second Opium War]], forcing the Qing Empire to cede [[Kowloon]] in 1860, while leasing the [[New Territories]] for 99 years from 1898.\n\nJapan occupied Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945 during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. By the end of the war in 1945, Hong Kong had been liberated by joint British and Chinese troops and returned to British rule. Hong Kong greatly increased its population from refugees from Mainland China, particularly during the [[Korean War|Korea War]] and the [[Great Leap Forward]]. In the 1950s, Hong Kong transformed from a territory of [[entrep\u00f4t|entrep\u00f4t trade]] to one of industry and manufacturing. The [[Chinese economic reform]] prompted manufacturers to relocate to China, leading Hong Kong to develop its commercial and financial industry.\n\nIn 1984, the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], which incited a wave of emigration from Hong Kong. The [[Handover of Hong Kong]] on July 1, 1997, returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule, and it adopted the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].\n\nIn the 21st century, Hong Kong has continued to enjoy success as a financial center. However, civil unrest, dissatisfaction with the government and Chinese influence, in general, has been a central issue. The planned implementation of [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23]] caused great controversy and a [[2003 July 1st protest|massive demonstration on 1 July 2003]], causing the bill to be shelved. Citizens expressed displeasure at their electoral system, culminating in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]]. The proposed [[Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019|Hong Kong extradition bill]] was seen as another step taken by the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] to undermine the law and human rights in Hong Kong, instigating [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests|multiple protests]].\n\n==Prehistoric era==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Hong Kong}}\n\nArchaeological findings suggesting human activity in Hong Kong date back over 30,000 years. Stone tools from the [[Paleolithic|Old Stone Age]] have been excavated in [[Sai Kung District|Sai Kung]] in [[Wong Tei Tung]]. The stone tools found in Sai Kung were perhaps from a stone tool making ground. Religious carvings on outlying islands and coastal areas have also been found, possibly related to [[She people]] in the [[Neolithic]].\n\nEvidence of an [[Upper Paleolithic]] settlement in Hong Kong was found at [[Wong Tei Tung]] in [[Sham Chung]] beside the [[Three Fathoms Cove]] in [[Sai Kung Peninsula]]. There were 6000 [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] found in a slope in the area and jointly confirmed by the [[Hong Kong Archaeological Society]] and Centre for Lingnan Archaeology of [[Zhongshan University]].<ref>[http://www.hkarch.org/en_news.html 2005 Field Archaeology on Sham Chung Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303144015/http://www.hkarch.org/en_news.html |date=3 March 2009 }} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/901620389 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/858316683 cite #2 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

The settlers in this area during that time were the [[Che people]], who also settled on the coast of Southern China. Excavations were mostly found on the western shores of Hong Kong. This location was most likely chosen to avoid strong winds from the southeast and to collect food from the nearby shores. Settlement can be found in [[Cheung Chau]], [[Lantau Island]] and [[Lamma Island]].\n\nThe coming of the [[Warring States period]] brought an influx of [[Baiyue|Yuet people]] from the north into the area. They probably might have avoided the instabilities at the north and went south. [[Bronze]] fishing, combat, and ritual tools were excavated on Lantau Island and Lamma Island. [[Ma Wan]] was the earliest settlement with direct evidence in Hong Kong. The Yuet people competed and assimilated with the indigenous Che people.<ref>Meacham, William (2008). ''The Archaeology of Hong Kong''. [[Hong Kong University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-9622099258}}.</ref> Hong Kong's prehistoric period ended roughly around the duration of the Qin and Han dynasties, when the territory became part of [[Panyu District|Panyu County]].\n\n==Imperial China era (221 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1911 AD)==\n[[File:Map of Xin'an County (in Canton) in 1866.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Bao'an County|Bao'an (Po On) County]] in 1866. It shows that Hong Kong and Shenzhen used to be a part of Bao'an County in the [[Qing dynasty]]]]\n{{Main|History of Hong Kong under Imperial China}}\n{{see also|Nanyue|Bao'an County}}\n\nThe territory that now comprises Hong Kong was loosely part of China during the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206&nbsp;BC), and the area was part of the ancient kingdom of [[Nanyue]] (203\u2013111&nbsp;BC). During the Qin dynasty, the territory was governed by [[Panyu County]] until the time of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]].\n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that the population increased during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD 220). In the 1950s, the [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum|tomb at Lei Cheng Uk]] from the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] (25\u2013220&nbsp;AD) was excavated and archaeologists began to investigate the possibility that salt production flourished in Hong Kong around 2000 years ago, although conclusive evidence has not been found. [[Tai Po Hoi]], the sea of Tai Po, was a major [[pearl hunting]] harbour in China from the Han dynasty through to the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), with activities peaking during the [[Southern Han]] (917\u2013971).\n\nDuring the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] until the early [[Tang dynasty]], Hong Kong was governed by [[Bao'an County]]. Under the [[Tang dynasty]], the [[Guangdong]] region flourished as an international trading centre. The [[Tuen Mun]] region in what is now Hong Kong's [[New Territories]] served as a port, naval base, salt production centre and later as a base for the exploitation of pearls. [[Lantau Island]] was also a salt production centre, where riots by salt smugglers against the government broke out. From the middle of the Tang dynasty until the Ming dynasty, Hong Kong was governed by [[Dongguan County]].\n\nIn 1276, during the [[Mongol]] invasion, the [[Southern Song dynasty]] court moved to [[Fujian]], then to Lantau Island and later to today's [[Sung Wong Toi|Kowloon City]]. [[Emperor Bing of Song|Emperor Huaizong of Song]], the last Song Dynasty emperor, was enthroned at [[Mui Wo]] on Lantau Island on 10&nbsp;May 1278 at the age of eight. This event is commemorated by the [[Sung Wong Toi]] in Kowloon. After his defeat at the [[Battle of Yamen]] on 19&nbsp;March 1279, the child emperor committed suicide by drowning with his officials at Mount Ya (modern [[Yamen (town)|Yamen Town]] in Guangdong). [[Tung Chung]] valley, named after a hero who gave up his life for the emperor, is believed to have been one of the locations for his court. [[Hau Wong]], an official of the emperor, is still worshipped in Hong Kong today.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring the Mongol period, Hong Kong saw its first population boom as Chinese refugees entered the area. Many refugees were driven by war and famine. Others arrived seeking employment. The [[Five Great Clans of the New Territories|five clans]] of [[Hau (surname)|Hau]], [[Tang Clan|Tang]], [[Peng (surname)|Pang]] and [[Liao (surname)|Liu]] and [[Wen (surname)|Man]] were Chinese from [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]] and [[Jiangxi]] who lived mostly in the [[New Territories]] and eventually became [[Punti]] speakers.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDespite the immigration and sparse development of agriculture, the area was hilly and relatively barren. People had to rely on salt, pearl and fishery trades to produce income. Some clans built [[walled villages of Hong Kong|walled villages]] to protect themselves from the threat of bandits, rival clans and wild animals. The Qing-dynasty Chinese pirate [[Cheung Po Tsai]] became a legend in Hong Kong. During the [[Ming dynasty]], Hong Kong was administered by Xin'an County.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], Hong Kong remained under the governance of Xin'an County, before it was colonised by [[British government|the British]]. As a military outpost and trading port, Hong Kong's territory gained the attention of the world. After the [[Great Clearance]] policy, ordered by the [[Kangxi Emperor]], many [[Hakka|Hakka people]] migrated from inland China to Xin'an County, which included modern Hong Kong.\n\nBefore the British government colonised the [[New Territories]] and [[New Kowloon]] in 1898, [[Punti]], [[Hakka]], [[Tanka (ethnic group)|Tanka]] and [[Hokkien]] people had migrated to and stayed in Hong Kong for many years. They are the [[Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|indigenous inhabitants]] of Hong Kong.

While the British exported to China luxury items like clocks and watches, there remained an overwhelming imbalance in trade. China developed a strong demand for silver, which was a difficult commodity for the British to come by in large quantities. The counterbalance of trade came with exports of opium to China, opium being legal in Britain and grown in significant quantities in the UK<ref>International Substance Abuse library \"http://www.drugtext.org/library/books/opiumpeople/opiuminthefens.html\" Retrieved on 26 March 2011.</ref> and later in far greater quantities in India.\n\nA Chinese commissioner [[Lin Zexu]] voiced to [[Queen Victoria]] the Qing state's opposition to the opium trade. The [[First Opium War]] which ensued lasted from 1839 to 1842. Britain occupied the island of Hong Kong on 25 January 1841 and used it as a military staging point. China was defeated and was forced to cede Hong Kong to Britain in the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on 29 August 1842. Hong Kong became a [[crown colony|Crown Colony]] of the British Empire.\n\nChristian missionaries founded many schools and churches in Hong Kong. St Stephen's Anglican Church located in West Point was founded by the [[Church Mission Society]] in 1865. [[Ying Wa Girls' School]] located in Mid-levels was founded by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1900. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was founded by the London Missionary Society in 1887, and [[Sun Yat-sen]] was one of its first two graduates in 1892. The college was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which was established in 1911.\n\n[[File:City of Victoria.jpg|thumb|Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong Island in the 1860s]]\nAlong with fellow students [[Yeung Hok-ling]], [[Chan Siu-bak]] and [[Yau Lit]], Sun Yat-sen started to promote the thought of overthrowing the Qing empire while he studied in the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. The four students were known by the Qing as the [[Four Bandits]]. Sun attended To Tsai Church (\u9053\u6fdf\u6703\u5802, founded by the London Missionary Society in 1888) while he studied in this College. Sun led the [[Chinese Revolution of 1911]], which changed China from an empire to a republic.\n\nIn April 1899, the residents of [[Kam Tin]] rebelled against the colonial government.

However, Hong Kong's population continued to boom in the following decades from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925. Nonetheless the crisis in mainland China in the 1920s and 1930s left Hong Kong vulnerable to a strategic invasion from [[Imperial Japan]].\n\n== British lease of Kowloon and the New Territories ==\n[[File:KWC - 1989 Aerial.jpg|thumb|By 1990, the [[Kowloon Walled City]] contained 50,000 residents within its {{convert|2.6|ha|acre|adj=on}} borders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nosowitz|first=Dan|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-04/life-inside-most-densely-populated-place-earth-infographic#page-2|title=Life Inside The Most Densely Populated Place On Earth [Infographic]|website=Popular Science|publisher=[[Popular Science]]|quote=\"1990 50,000 inhabitants\"|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>]]\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, the British had grown increasingly worried about the security of their free port at Hong Kong. It was an isolated island, surrounded by areas still under Chinese control. The British decided the answer would be to lease a buffer zone around Hong Kong that would make the island less vulnerable to invasion.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1860, at the end of the Second Opium War, the UK gained a perpetual lease over the Kowloon Peninsula, which is the mainland Chinese area just across the strait from Hong Kong Island. This agreement was part of the Convention of Beijing that ended that conflict.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1898, the British and Chinese governments signed the Second Convention of Peking, which included a 99-year lease agreement for the islands surrounding Hong Kong, called the \"New Territories\". The lease awarded control of more than 200 surrounding small islands to the British. In return, China received a promise that the islands would be returned to it after 99 years, at the end of the single negotiated term of lease.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 19 December 1984, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which Britain agreed to return not only the New Territories but also Kowloon and Hong Kong itself when the lease term expired. China promised to implement a \"One Country, Two Systems\" regime, under which for fifty years Hong Kong citizens could continue to practice capitalism and political freedoms forbidden on the mainland.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn {{start date and age|1997|7|1|df=y|paren=y}}, the lease ended, and the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong and surrounding territories to the People's Republic of China.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Japanese occupation era (1940s)==\n{{Main|Battle of Hong Kong|Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong}}\n\nHong Kong was occupied by Japan from 23 December 1941 to 15 August 1945. The period, called '3 years and 8 months' halted the economy. The British, Canadians, Indians and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Forces resisted the Japanese invasion commanded by [[Sakai Takashi]] which started on 8 December 1941, eight hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Japan achieved air superiority on the first day of battle and the defensive forces were outnumbered. The British and the Indians retreated from the [[Gin Drinker's Line]] and consequently from [[Kowloon]] under heavy aerial bombardment and artillery barrage. Fierce fighting continued on [[Hong Kong Island]]; the only [[Reservoirs in Hong Kong|reservoir]] was lost. Canadian [[Winnipeg Grenadiers]] fought at the crucial [[Wong Nai Chong Gap]], which was the passage between the north and the secluded southern parts of the island.\n\nOn 25 December 1941, referred to as ''Black Christmas'' by locals, British colonial officials headed by the [[Governor of Hong Kong]], [[Mark Aitchison Young]], surrendered in person at the Japanese headquarters on the third floor of the [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]]. [[Isogai Rensuke]] became the first Japanese governor of Hong Kong.\n\n[[File:JapaneseWarCriminalsHK.jpg|thumb|Japanese war criminals prepare for their transfer to [[Stanley Prison]]]]\nDuring the Japanese occupation, [[hyper-inflation]] and food rationing became the norm of daily lives. It became unlawful to own [[Hong Kong Dollar]]s, which were replaced by the [[Japanese Military Yen]], a currency without reserves issued by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] administration. Although there is a lack of testimonial evidence from the female victims of Hong Kong, according to some eyewitnesses thousands of females could have been raped.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. During the three and half years of occupation by the Japanese, an estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|p=123}} Philip Snow, a prominent historian of the period, said that the Japanese cut rations for civilians to conserve food for soldiers, usually to starvation levels and deported many to famine- and disease-ridden areas of the [[mainland China|mainland]]. Most of the repatriated had come to Hong Kong just a few years earlier to flee the terror of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in mainland China.\n\nBy the end of the war in 1945, Hong Kong had been liberated by joint British and Chinese troops. The population of Hong Kong had shrunk to 600,000; less than half of the pre-war population of 1.6 million due to scarcity of food and emigration. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution in China]] in 1949 led to another population boom in Hong Kong. Thousands of [[refugee]]s emigrated from mainland China to Hong Kong, and made it an important [[entrep\u00f4t]] until the United Nations ordered a [[trade embargo]] on mainland China due to the [[Korean War]]. More refugees came during the [[Great Leap Forward]].\n\n==Post Japanese occupation==\n\nAfter the Second World War, the trend of decolonization swept across the world. Still, Britain chose to keep Hong Kong for strategic reasons. In order to consolidate its rule, constitutional changes, the [[Young Plan (Hong Kong)|Young Plan]], were proposed in response to the trend of decolonization so as to meet the needs of the people. The political and institutional system made only minimal changes due to the political instability in Mainland China at that time (aforementioned) which caused an influx of mainland residents to Hong Kong.\n\n==Modern Hong Kong==\n\n===Modern Hong Kong under British rule (1950s\u20131997)===\n\n====1950s====\n[[File:Hk1950.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1950s]]\n{{Main| the 1950s in Hong Kong}}\nSkills and capital brought by refugees of Mainland China, especially from Shanghai, along with a vast pool of cheap labour helped revive the economy. At the same time, many foreign firms relocated their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Enjoying unprecedented growth, Hong Kong transformed from a territory of [[entrep\u00f4t|entrep\u00f4t trade]] to one of industry and manufacturing. The early industrial centres, where many of the workers spent the majority of their days, turned out anything that could be produced with small space from [[buttons]], [[artificial flowers]], [[umbrellas]], [[textile]], [[enamelware]], [[footwear]] to\n\nLarge squatter camps developed throughout the territory providing homes for the massive and growing number of immigrants. The camps, however, posed a fire and health hazard, leading to disasters like the [[Shek Kip Mei Fire]]. Governor [[Alexander Grantham]] responded with a \"multi-storey buildings\" plan as a standard. It was the beginning of the high rise buildings. Conditions in public housing were very basic with several families sharing communal cooking facilities. Other aspects of life changed as traditional [[Cantonese opera]] gave way to [[cinema of Hong Kong|big screen cinemas]]. [[Tourism in Hong Kong|The tourism industry]] began to formalise. [[North Point]] was known as ''\"Little Shanghai\"'' (\u5c0f\u4e0a\u6d77), since in the minds of many, it had already become the replacement for the surrendered Shanghai in China.<ref name=\"Wordie\">{{cite book |title= Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island|last= Wordie|first= Jason|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Hong Kong University Press]]|location= Hong Kong|isbn= 962-209-563-1|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n====1960s====\n[[File:Hk1960c.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Kowloon City]] and [[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1960s]]\n{{Main|1960s in Hong Kong}}\nThe manufacturing industry opened a new decade employing large sections of the population. The period is considered a turning point for Hong Kong's economy. The construction business was also revamped with new detailed guidelines for the first time since World War II. While Hong Kong started out with a low [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], it used the textile industry as the foundation to boost the economy. China's [[cultural revolution]] put Hong Kong on a new political stage. Events like the [[Hong Kong 1967 riots|1967 riot]] filled the streets with [[Improvised explosive device|home-made bombs]] and chaos. Bomb disposal experts from the police and the [[British military]] defused as many as 8,000 home-made bombs. One in every eight bombs was genuine.<ref>Wiltshire, Trea.

Hong Kong consolidated its position as a commercial and tourism centre in Asia. High [[life expectancy]], literacy, per-capita income and other socio-economic measures attest to Hong Kong's achievements over the last four decades of the 20th century. Higher income also led to the introduction of the first high-rise, [[private housing estates]] with [[Taikoo Shing]]. From this time, people's homes became part of Hong Kong's skyline and scenery.\n\nIn 1974, [[MacLehose of Beoch|Murray McLehose]] founded the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong|ICAC]], the Independent Commission Against Corruption, in order to combat corruption within the [[Hong Kong Police Force|police force]]. The corruption was so widespread that a mass police petition took place resisting prosecutions. Despite early opposition to the ICAC by the police force, Hong Kong was successful in its anti-corruption efforts, eventually becoming one of the [[Index of perception of corruption|least corrupt societies in the world]].\n\nThe early 1970s saw legislation requiring equal pay and benefits for equal work by men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees.<ref>[http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived Toronto SUN<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716175556/http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived |date=16 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001 |title=Celebrating two lives well lived : Featured OTT : Videos<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=24 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704133812/http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001 |archive-date=4 July 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://torontosun.com/2012/04/07/life-love-and-service-recalled/wcm/a26742dc-a92a-4197-9e07-f3cb876e0578|title=Life, love and service - Toronto Sun|first1=Toronto|last1=SUN|first2=love and service Tumblr Pinterest Google Plus Reddit LinkedIn Email|last2=Share Life|first3=|last3=Tumblr|first4=|last4=Pinterest|first5=Google|last5=Plus|first6=|last6=Reddit|first7=|last7=LinkedIn|first8=|last8=Email|first9=NewsWoman badly hurt in Etobicoke condo|last9=shooting|first10=NewsPOLAR PLUNGE: Cops brave cold in Lake Ontario dip for 'special'|last10=cause|first11=NewsWHEELIE BIG HEARTS: Cops rescue wheelchair-bound man from|last11=cold|first12=NewsCRIME SCENE: Fire doused; crook sought; murder victim|last12=ID'd|date=7 April 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====1980s====\n[[File:hk1989a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1980s]]\n{{Main|1980s in Hong Kong}}\nIn 1982, the British Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], hoped that the increasing openness of the PRC government and the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reform]] in the mainland would allow the continuation of British rule. The resulting meeting led to the signing of [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the proposal of the [[One country, two systems]] concept by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Political news dominated the media, while [[Economy of Hong Kong|real estate]] took a major upswing. The financial world was also rattled by panics, leading to waves of policy changes and [[Black Saturday (1983)|Black Saturday]]. Meanwhile, Hong Kong was now recognised as one of the wealthiest representatives of the far east. At the same time, the warnings of the 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] raised [[emigration]] statistics to historic highs. Many left Hong Kong for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and anywhere else in the world without any communist influence.\n\n[[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong's Cinema]] enjoyed one paramount run that put it on the international map. Some of the biggest names included [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Chow Yun-fat]]. The music world also saw a new group of [[cantopop]] stars like [[Anita Mui]] and [[Leslie Cheung]].\n\n====1990s====\n[[File:HK1996t.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1990s]]\n{{Main|1990s in Hong Kong|Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong}}\nOn 4 April 1990, the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] was officially accepted as the mini-constitution of the Hong Kong SAR after the handover. The pro-Beijing bloc welcomed the Basic Law, calling it the most democratic legal system to ever exist in the PRC. The pro-democratic bloc criticised it as not democratic enough. In July 1992, [[Chris Patten]] was appointed as the last British [[Governor of Hong Kong]]. Patten had been Chairman of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK until he lost his parliamentary seat in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election]] earlier that year. Relations with the PRC government in Beijing became increasingly strained, as [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|Patten introduced democratic reforms]] that increased the number of elected members in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]. The PRC government viewed this as a breach of the Basic Law. On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was handed over to Communist China by the United Kingdom. The old Legislative Council, elected under Chris Patten's reforms, was replaced by the Provisional Legislative Council elected by a selection committee whose members were appointed by the PRC government. [[Tung Chee Hwa]] assumed duty as the first [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], elected in December by a selection committee with members appointed by the PRC government. He immediately reappointed the entire team of policy secretaries, guaranteeing significant continuity.<ref>Brian Hook, \"British views of the legacy of the colonial administration of Hong Kong: A preliminary assessment,\" ''[[China Quarterly]]'' (1997) Issue 151, pp. 553{{ndash}}66</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=50% | Unchanged after 1997\n! width=50% | Changed after 1997\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n# The long-held British practice of no general elections by HK citizens remains unchanged.\n# English is still taught in all schools.

A sizeable portion of the population that was previously against the handover found itself living with the adjustments. [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23]] became a controversy, and led to marches in different parts of Hong Kong with as many as 750,000 people out of a population of approximately 6,800,000 at the time. The government also dealt with the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS outbreak]] in 2003. A further health crisis, the [[Global spread of H5N1|Bird Flu Pandemic]] (H5N1) gained momentum from the late 90s, and led to the disposal of millions of chickens and other poultry. The slaughter put Hong Kong at the centre of global attention. At the same time, the economy tried to adjust fiscally. Within a short time, the political climate heated up and the Chief Executive position was challenged culturally, politically and managerially. [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], [[Lantau]] was also launched during this period. In 2009 Hong Kong suffered from another a [[2009 flu pandemic in Hong Kong|flu pandemic]] which resulted in a school closure for two weeks.\n\nHong Kong's skylines have continued to evolve, with three new skyscrapers dominating, each in [[Kowloon]], [[Tsuen Wan]] and [[Victoria, Hong Kong]]. The 415 metre (1,362-feet) tall 88 storey [[Two International Finance Centre]], completed in 2003, previously Hong Kong's tallest building, has been eclipsed by the 484 metre (1,588-feet) tall, 118 storey [[International Commerce Centre]] in West Kowloon, which was topped-out in 2010 and remains the tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong.

The [[anti-Hong Kong Express Rail Link movement]] protested at the proposed Hong Kong section of the [[Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link]]; the link was nevertheless completed in 2018. The [[Hong Kong 818 incident]], inhibited by the visit of [[Li Keqiang]], caused controversy regarding civil rights violations. The [[Moral and National Education controversy]]  exemplified the conflict between [[communist]] and [[nationalist]] positions of China's government with democratic sentiments expressed by Hong Kong citizens.\n\nThe [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative council election]] saw the localists emerging as a new political force behind the [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] and [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy]] camps by winning six seats in Hong Kong's [[geographical constituencies]]. However, six candidates were [[2016 Hong Kong LegCo candidates' disqualification controversy|barred from contesting]] by the [[Electoral Affairs Commission]], due to their association with the [[Hong Kong independence]] movement. Another six localist members who were elected were disqualified in the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]. After the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|5th Hong Kong Chief Executive Election]], Carrie Lam became the first female Chief Executive of Hong Kong. However, her proposal of the [[Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019]] has led to [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests|mass demonstrations]] against its implementation. The bill would make it legal for China to extradite criminals from Hong Kong, potentially including [[political prisoner]]s.

Starting out as a [[Walled villages of Hong Kong|farming]] fishing [[List of villages in Hong Kong|village]] and salt production site, it became an important free port and eventually a major international [[financial centre]].<ref>CIA gov. \"[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html CIA].\" ''HK GDP 2004.'' Retrieved on 6 March 2007.</ref>\n\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] ceded Hong Kong to the [[British Empire]] in 1842 through the [[treaty of Nanjing]], ending the [[First Opium War]]. Hong Kong then became a British [[crown colony]]. Britain also won the [[Second Opium War]], forcing the Qing Empire to cede Kowloon in 1860, while leasing the [[New Territories]] for 99 years from 1898.\n\nJapan occupied Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945 during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. By the end of the war in 1945, Hong Kong had been liberated by joint British and Chinese troops and returned to British rule. Hong Kong greatly increased its population from refugees from Mainland China, particularly during the [[Korean War|Korea War]] and the [[Great Leap Forward]]. In the 1950s, Hong Kong transformed from a territory of [[entrep\u00f4t|entrep\u00f4t trade]] to one of industry and manufacturing. The [[Chinese economic reform]] prompted manufacturers to relocate to China, leading Hong Kong to develop its commercial and financial industry.\n\nIn 1984, the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], which incited a wave of emigration from Hong Kong. The [[Handover of Hong Kong]] on July 1, 1997, returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule, and it adopted the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].\n\nIn the 21st century, Hong Kong has continued to enjoy success as a financial center. However, civil unrest, dissatisfaction with the government and Chinese influence, in general, has been a central issue. The planned implementation of [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23]] caused great controversy and a [[2003 July 1st protest|massive demonstration on 1 July 2003]], causing the bill to be shelved. Citizens expressed displeasure at their electoral system, culminating in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]]. The proposed [[Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019|Hong Kong extradition bill]] was seen as another step taken by the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] to undermine the law and human rights in Hong Kong, instigating [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests|multiple protests]].\n\n==Prehistoric era==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Hong Kong}}\n\nArchaeological findings suggesting human activity in Hong Kong date back over 30,000 years. Stone tools from the [[Paleolithic|Old Stone Age]] have been excavated in [[Sai Kung District|Sai Kung]] in [[Wong Tei Tung]]. The stone tools found in Sai Kung were perhaps from a stone tool making ground. Religious carvings on outlying islands and coastal areas have also been found, possibly related to [[She people]] in the [[Neolithic]].\n\nEvidence of an [[Upper Paleolithic]] settlement in Hong Kong was found at [[Wong Tei Tung]] in [[Sham Chung]] beside the [[Three Fathoms Cove]] in [[Sai Kung Peninsula]]. There were 6000 [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] found in a slope in the area and jointly confirmed by the [[Hong Kong Archaeological Society]] and Centre for Lingnan Archaeology of [[Zhongshan University]].<ref>[http://www.hkarch.org/en_news.html 2005 Field Archaeology on Sham Chung Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303144015/http://www.hkarch.org/en_news.html |date=3 March 2009 }} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/901620389 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/858316683 cite #2 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

The settlers in this area during that time were the [[Che people]], who also settled on the coast of Southern China. Excavations were mostly found on the western shores of Hong Kong. This location was most likely chosen to avoid strong winds from the southeast and to collect food from the nearby shores. Settlement can be found in [[Cheung Chau]], [[Lantau Island]] and [[Lamma Island]].\n\nThe coming of the [[Warring States period]] brought an influx of [[Baiyue|Yuet people]] from the north into the area. They probably might have avoided the instabilities at the north and went south. [[Bronze]] fishing, combat, and ritual tools were excavated on Lantau Island and Lamma Island. [[Ma Wan]] was the earliest settlement with direct evidence in Hong Kong. The Yuet people competed and assimilated with the indigenous Che people.<ref>Meacham, William (2008). ''The Archaeology of Hong Kong''. [[Hong Kong University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-9622099258}}.</ref> Hong Kong's prehistoric period ended roughly around the duration of the Qin and Han dynasties, when the territory became part of [[Panyu District|Panyu County]].\n\n==Imperial China era (221 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1911 AD)==\n[[File:Map of Xin'an County (in Canton) in 1866.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Bao'an County|Bao'an (Po On) County]] in 1866. It shows that Hong Kong and Shenzhen used to be a part of Bao'an County in the [[Qing dynasty]]]]\n{{Main|History of Hong Kong under Imperial China}}\n{{see also|Nanyue|Bao'an County}}\n\nThe territory that now comprises Hong Kong was loosely part of China during the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206&nbsp;BC), and the area was part of the ancient kingdom of [[Nanyue]] (203\u2013111&nbsp;BC). During the Qin dynasty, the territory was governed by [[Panyu County]] until the time of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]].\n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that the population increased during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD 220). In the 1950s, the [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum|tomb at Lei Cheng Uk]] from the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] (25\u2013220&nbsp;AD) was excavated and archaeologists began to investigate the possibility that salt production flourished in Hong Kong around 2000 years ago, although conclusive evidence has not been found. [[Tai Po Hoi]], the sea of Tai Po, was a major [[pearl hunting]] harbour in China from the Han dynasty through to the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), with activities peaking during the [[Southern Han]] (917\u2013971).\n\nDuring the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] until the early [[Tang dynasty]], Hong Kong was governed by [[Bao'an County]]. Under the [[Tang dynasty]], the [[Guangdong]] region flourished as an international trading centre. The [[Tuen Mun]] region in what is now Hong Kong's [[New Territories]] served as a port, naval base, salt production centre and later as a base for the exploitation of pearls. [[Lantau Island]] was also a salt production centre, where riots by salt smugglers against the government broke out. From the middle of the Tang dynasty until the Ming dynasty, Hong Kong was governed by [[Dongguan County]].\n\nIn 1276, during the [[Mongol]] invasion, the [[Southern Song dynasty]] court moved to [[Fujian]], then to Lantau Island and later to today's [[Sung Wong Toi|Kowloon City]]. [[Emperor Bing of Song|Emperor Huaizong of Song]], the last Song Dynasty emperor, was enthroned at [[Mui Wo]] on Lantau Island on 10&nbsp;May 1278 at the age of eight. This event is commemorated by the [[Sung Wong Toi]] in Kowloon. After his defeat at the [[Battle of Yamen]] on 19&nbsp;March 1279, the child emperor committed suicide by drowning with his officials at Mount Ya (modern [[Yamen (town)|Yamen Town]] in Guangdong). [[Tung Chung]] valley, named after a hero who gave up his life for the emperor, is believed to have been one of the locations for his court. [[Hau Wong]], an official of the emperor, is still worshipped in Hong Kong today.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring the Mongol period, Hong Kong saw its first population boom as Chinese refugees entered the area. Many refugees were driven by war and famine. Others arrived seeking employment. The [[Five Great Clans of the New Territories|five clans]] of [[Hau (surname)|Hau]], [[Tang Clan|Tang]], [[Peng (surname)|Pang]] and [[Liao (surname)|Liu]] and [[Wen (surname)|Man]] were Chinese from [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]] and [[Jiangxi]] who lived mostly in the [[New Territories]] and eventually became [[Punti]] speakers.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDespite the immigration and sparse development of agriculture, the area was hilly and relatively barren. People had to rely on salt, pearl and fishery trades to produce income. Some clans built [[walled villages of Hong Kong|walled villages]] to protect themselves from the threat of bandits, rival clans and wild animals. The Qing-dynasty Chinese pirate [[Cheung Po Tsai]] became a legend in Hong Kong. During the [[Ming dynasty]], Hong Kong was administered by Xin'an County.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], Hong Kong remained under the governance of Xin'an County, before it was colonised by [[British government|the British]]. As a military outpost and trading port, Hong Kong's territory gained the attention of the world. After the [[Great Clearance]] policy, ordered by the [[Kangxi Emperor]], many [[Hakka|Hakka people]] migrated from inland China to Xin'an County, which included modern Hong Kong.\n\nBefore the British government colonised the [[New Territories]] and [[New Kowloon]] in 1898, [[Punti]], [[Hakka]], [[Tanka (ethnic group)|Tanka]] and [[Hokkien]] people had migrated to and stayed in Hong Kong for many years. They are the [[Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|indigenous inhabitants]] of Hong Kong.

While the British exported to China luxury items like clocks and watches, there remained an overwhelming imbalance in trade. China developed a strong demand for silver, which was a difficult commodity for the British to come by in large quantities. The counterbalance of trade came with exports of opium to China, opium being legal in Britain and grown in significant quantities in the UK<ref>International Substance Abuse library \"http://www.drugtext.org/library/books/opiumpeople/opiuminthefens.html\" Retrieved on 26 March 2011.</ref> and later in far greater quantities in India.\n\nA Chinese commissioner [[Lin Zexu]] voiced to [[Queen Victoria]] the Qing state's opposition to the opium trade. The [[First Opium War]] which ensued lasted from 1839 to 1842. Britain occupied the island of Hong Kong on 25 January 1841 and used it as a military staging point. China was defeated and was forced to cede Hong Kong to Britain in the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on 29 August 1842. Hong Kong became a [[crown colony|Crown Colony]] of the British Empire.\n\nChristian missionaries founded many schools and churches in Hong Kong. St Stephen's Anglican Church located in West Point was founded by the [[Church Mission Society]] in 1865. [[Ying Wa Girls' School]] located in Mid-levels was founded by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1900. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was founded by the London Missionary Society in 1887, and [[Sun Yat-sen]] was one of its first two graduates in 1892. The college was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which was established in 1911.\n\n[[File:City of Victoria.jpg|thumb|Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong Island in the 1860s]]\nAlong with fellow students [[Yeung Hok-ling]], [[Chan Siu-bak]] and [[Yau Lit]], Sun Yat-sen started to promote the thought of overthrowing the Qing empire while he studied in the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. The four students were known by the Qing as the [[Four Bandits]]. Sun attended To Tsai Church (\u9053\u6fdf\u6703\u5802, founded by the London Missionary Society in 1888) while he studied in this College. Sun led the [[Chinese Revolution of 1911]], which changed China from an empire to a republic.\n\nIn April 1899, the residents of [[Kam Tin]] rebelled against the colonial government. They defended themselves in [[Kat Hing Wai]], a walled village. After several unsuccessful attacks by the British troops, the iron gate was blasted open. The gate was then shipped to London for exhibition. Under the demand of the [[Tang Clan|Tang clan]] in 1924, the gate was eventually returned in 1925 by the 16th governor, [[Reginald Edward Stubbs|Sir Reginald Stubbs]].\n\nSoon after [[Hong Kong and China Gas Company|the first gas company]] in 1862 came the [[Hongkong Electric|first electric company]] in 1890.

Nonetheless the crisis in mainland China in the 1920s and 1930s left Hong Kong vulnerable to a strategic invasion from [[Imperial Japan]].\n\n== British lease of Kowloon and the New Territories ==\n[[File:KWC - 1989 Aerial.jpg|thumb|By 1990, the [[Kowloon Walled City]] contained 50,000 residents within its {{convert|2.6|ha|acre|adj=on}} borders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nosowitz|first=Dan|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-04/life-inside-most-densely-populated-place-earth-infographic#page-2|title=Life Inside The Most Densely Populated Place On Earth [Infographic]|website=Popular Science|publisher=[[Popular Science]]|quote=\"1990 50,000 inhabitants\"|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>]]\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, the British had grown increasingly worried about the security of their free port at Hong Kong. It was an isolated island, surrounded by areas still under Chinese control. The British decided the answer would be to lease a buffer zone around Hong Kong that would make the island less vulnerable to invasion.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1860, at the end of the Second Opium War, the UK gained a perpetual lease over the Kowloon Peninsula, which is the mainland Chinese area just across the strait from Hong Kong Island. This agreement was part of the Convention of Beijing that ended that conflict.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1898, the British and Chinese governments signed the Second Convention of Peking, which included a 99-year lease agreement for the islands surrounding Hong Kong, called the \"New Territories\". The lease awarded control of more than 200 surrounding small islands to the British. In return, China received a promise that the islands would be returned to it after 99 years, at the end of the single negotiated term of lease.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 19 December 1984, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which Britain agreed to return not only the New Territories but also Kowloon and Hong Kong itself when the lease term expired. China promised to implement a \"One Country, Two Systems\" regime, under which for fifty years Hong Kong citizens could continue to practice capitalism and political freedoms forbidden on the mainland.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn {{start date and age|1997|7|1|df=y|paren=y}}, the lease ended, and the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong and surrounding territories to the People's Republic of China.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Japanese occupation era (1940s)==\n{{Main|Battle of Hong Kong|Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong}}\n\nHong Kong was occupied by Japan from 23 December 1941 to 15 August 1945. The period, called '3 years and 8 months' halted the economy. The British, Canadians, Indians and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Forces resisted the Japanese invasion commanded by [[Sakai Takashi]] which started on 8 December 1941, eight hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Japan achieved air superiority on the first day of battle and the defensive forces were outnumbered. The British and the Indians retreated from the [[Gin Drinker's Line]] and consequently from [[Kowloon]] under heavy aerial bombardment and artillery barrage. Fierce fighting continued on [[Hong Kong Island]]; the only [[Reservoirs in Hong Kong|reservoir]] was lost. Canadian [[Winnipeg Grenadiers]] fought at the crucial [[Wong Nai Chong Gap]], which was the passage between the north and the secluded southern parts of the island.\n\nOn 25 December 1941, referred to as ''Black Christmas'' by locals, British colonial officials headed by the [[Governor of Hong Kong]], [[Mark Aitchison Young]], surrendered in person at the Japanese headquarters on the third floor of the [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]]. [[Isogai Rensuke]] became the first Japanese governor of Hong Kong.\n\n[[File:JapaneseWarCriminalsHK.jpg|thumb|Japanese war criminals prepare for their transfer to [[Stanley Prison]]]]\nDuring the Japanese occupation, [[hyper-inflation]] and food rationing became the norm of daily lives. It became unlawful to own [[Hong Kong Dollar]]s, which were replaced by the [[Japanese Military Yen]], a currency without reserves issued by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] administration. Although there is a lack of testimonial evidence from the female victims of Hong Kong, according to some eyewitnesses thousands of females could have been raped.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. During the three and half years of occupation by the Japanese, an estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|p=123}} Philip Snow, a prominent historian of the period, said that the Japanese cut rations for civilians to conserve food for soldiers, usually to starvation levels and deported many to famine- and disease-ridden areas of the [[mainland China|mainland]]. Most of the repatriated had come to Hong Kong just a few years earlier to flee the terror of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in mainland China.\n\nBy the end of the war in 1945, Hong Kong had been liberated by joint British and Chinese troops. The population of Hong Kong had shrunk to 600,000; less than half of the pre-war population of 1.6 million due to scarcity of food and emigration. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution in China]] in 1949 led to another population boom in Hong Kong. Thousands of [[refugee]]s emigrated from mainland China to Hong Kong, and made it an important [[entrep\u00f4t]] until the United Nations ordered a [[trade embargo]] on mainland China due to the [[Korean War]]. More refugees came during the [[Great Leap Forward]].\n\n==Post Japanese occupation==\n\nAfter the Second World War, the trend of decolonization swept across the world. Still, Britain chose to keep Hong Kong for strategic reasons. In order to consolidate its rule, constitutional changes, the [[Young Plan (Hong Kong)|Young Plan]], were proposed in response to the trend of decolonization so as to meet the needs of the people. The political and institutional system made only minimal changes due to the political instability in Mainland China at that time (aforementioned) which caused an influx of mainland residents to Hong Kong.\n\n==Modern Hong Kong==\n\n===Modern Hong Kong under British rule (1950s\u20131997)===\n\n====1950s====\n[[File:Hk1950.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1950s]]\n{{Main| the 1950s in Hong Kong}}\nSkills and capital brought by refugees of Mainland China, especially from Shanghai, along with a vast pool of cheap labour helped revive the economy. At the same time, many foreign firms relocated their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Enjoying unprecedented growth, Hong Kong transformed from a territory of [[entrep\u00f4t|entrep\u00f4t trade]] to one of industry and manufacturing. The early industrial centres, where many of the workers spent the majority of their days, turned out anything that could be produced with small space from [[buttons]], [[artificial flowers]], [[umbrellas]], [[textile]], [[enamelware]], [[footwear]] to\n\nLarge squatter camps developed throughout the territory providing homes for the massive and growing number of immigrants. The camps, however, posed a fire and health hazard, leading to disasters like the [[Shek Kip Mei Fire]]. Governor [[Alexander Grantham]] responded with a \"multi-storey buildings\" plan as a standard. It was the beginning of the high rise buildings. Conditions in public housing were very basic with several families sharing communal cooking facilities. Other aspects of life changed as traditional [[Cantonese opera]] gave way to [[cinema of Hong Kong|big screen cinemas]]. [[Tourism in Hong Kong|The tourism industry]] began to formalise. [[North Point]] was known as ''\"Little Shanghai\"'' (\u5c0f\u4e0a\u6d77), since in the minds of many, it had already become the replacement for the surrendered Shanghai in China.<ref name=\"Wordie\">{{cite book |title= Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island|last= Wordie|first= Jason|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Hong Kong University Press]]|location= Hong Kong|isbn= 962-209-563-1|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n====1960s====\n[[File:Hk1960c.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Kowloon City]] and [[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1960s]]\n{{Main|1960s in Hong Kong}}\nThe manufacturing industry opened a new decade employing large sections of the population. The period is considered a turning point for Hong Kong's economy. The construction business was also revamped with new detailed guidelines for the first time since World War II. While Hong Kong started out with a low [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], it used the textile industry as the foundation to boost the economy. China's [[cultural revolution]] put Hong Kong on a new political stage. Events like the [[Hong Kong 1967 riots|1967 riot]] filled the streets with [[Improvised explosive device|home-made bombs]] and chaos. Bomb disposal experts from the police and the [[British military]] defused as many as 8,000 home-made bombs. One in every eight bombs was genuine.<ref>Wiltshire, Trea.

Hong Kong consolidated its position as a commercial and tourism centre in Asia. High [[life expectancy]], literacy, per-capita income and other socio-economic measures attest to Hong Kong's achievements over the last four decades of the 20th century. Higher income also led to the introduction of the first high-rise, [[private housing estates]] with [[Taikoo Shing]]. From this time, people's homes became part of Hong Kong's skyline and scenery.\n\nIn 1974, [[MacLehose of Beoch|Murray McLehose]] founded the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong|ICAC]], the Independent Commission Against Corruption, in order to combat corruption within the [[Hong Kong Police Force|police force]]. The corruption was so widespread that a mass police petition took place resisting prosecutions. Despite early opposition to the ICAC by the police force, Hong Kong was successful in its anti-corruption efforts, eventually becoming one of the [[Index of perception of corruption|least corrupt societies in the world]].\n\nThe early 1970s saw legislation requiring equal pay and benefits for equal work by men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees.<ref>[http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived Toronto SUN<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716175556/http://m.torontosun.com/2012/04/06/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived |date=16 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001 |title=Celebrating two lives well lived : Featured OTT : Videos<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=24 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704133812/http://www.ottawasun.com/videos/celebrating-two-lives-well-lived/1550780688001 |archive-date=4 July 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://torontosun.com/2012/04/07/life-love-and-service-recalled/wcm/a26742dc-a92a-4197-9e07-f3cb876e0578|title=Life, love and service - Toronto Sun|first1=Toronto|last1=SUN|first2=love and service Tumblr Pinterest Google Plus Reddit LinkedIn Email|last2=Share Life|first3=|last3=Tumblr|first4=|last4=Pinterest|first5=Google|last5=Plus|first6=|last6=Reddit|first7=|last7=LinkedIn|first8=|last8=Email|first9=NewsWoman badly hurt in Etobicoke condo|last9=shooting|first10=NewsPOLAR PLUNGE: Cops brave cold in Lake Ontario dip for 'special'|last10=cause|first11=NewsWHEELIE BIG HEARTS: Cops rescue wheelchair-bound man from|last11=cold|first12=NewsCRIME SCENE: Fire doused; crook sought; murder victim|last12=ID'd|date=7 April 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====1980s====\n[[File:hk1989a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1980s]]\n{{Main|1980s in Hong Kong}}\nIn 1982, the British Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], hoped that the increasing openness of the PRC government and the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reform]] in the mainland would allow the continuation of British rule. The resulting meeting led to the signing of [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and the proposal of the [[One country, two systems]] concept by [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Political news dominated the media, while [[Economy of Hong Kong|real estate]] took a major upswing. The financial world was also rattled by panics, leading to waves of policy changes and [[Black Saturday (1983)|Black Saturday]]. Meanwhile, Hong Kong was now recognised as one of the wealthiest representatives of the far east. At the same time, the warnings of the 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] raised [[emigration]] statistics to historic highs. Many left Hong Kong for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and anywhere else in the world without any communist influence.\n\n[[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong's Cinema]] enjoyed one paramount run that put it on the international map. Some of the biggest names included [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Chow Yun-fat]]. The music world also saw a new group of [[cantopop]] stars like [[Anita Mui]] and [[Leslie Cheung]].\n\n====1990s====\n[[File:HK1996t.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Victoria, Hong Kong]], 1990s]]\n{{Main|1990s in Hong Kong|Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong}}\nOn 4 April 1990, the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] was officially accepted as the mini-constitution of the Hong Kong SAR after the handover. The pro-Beijing bloc welcomed the Basic Law, calling it the most democratic legal system to ever exist in the PRC. The pro-democratic bloc criticised it as not democratic enough. In July 1992, [[Chris Patten]] was appointed as the last British [[Governor of Hong Kong]]. Patten had been Chairman of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK until he lost his parliamentary seat in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election]] earlier that year. Relations with the PRC government in Beijing became increasingly strained, as [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|Patten introduced democratic reforms]] that increased the number of elected members in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]. The PRC government viewed this as a breach of the Basic Law. On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was handed over to Communist China by the United Kingdom. The old Legislative Council, elected under Chris Patten's reforms, was replaced by the Provisional Legislative Council elected by a selection committee whose members were appointed by the PRC government. [[Tung Chee Hwa]] assumed duty as the first [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], elected in December by a selection committee with members appointed by the PRC government. He immediately reappointed the entire team of policy secretaries, guaranteeing significant continuity.<ref>Brian Hook, \"British views of the legacy of the colonial administration of Hong Kong: A preliminary assessment,\" ''[[China Quarterly]]'' (1997) Issue 151, pp. 553{{ndash}}66</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=50% | Unchanged after 1997\n! width=50% | Changed after 1997\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n# The long-held British practice of no general elections by HK citizens remains unchanged.\n# English is still taught in all schools.

A sizeable portion of the population that was previously against the handover found itself living with the adjustments. [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23]] became a controversy, and led to marches in different parts of Hong Kong with as many as 750,000 people out of a population of approximately 6,800,000 at the time. The government also dealt with the [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS outbreak]] in 2003. A further health crisis, the [[Global spread of H5N1|Bird Flu Pandemic]] (H5N1) gained momentum from the late 90s, and led to the disposal of millions of chickens and other poultry. The slaughter put Hong Kong at the centre of global attention. At the same time, the economy tried to adjust fiscally. Within a short time, the political climate heated up and the Chief Executive position was challenged culturally, politically and managerially. [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], [[Lantau]] was also launched during this period. In 2009 Hong Kong suffered from another a [[2009 flu pandemic in Hong Kong|flu pandemic]] which resulted in a school closure for two weeks.\n\nHong Kong's skylines have continued to evolve, with three new skyscrapers dominating, each in [[Kowloon]], [[Tsuen Wan]] and [[Victoria, Hong Kong]]. The 415 metre (1,362-feet) tall 88 storey [[Two International Finance Centre]], completed in 2003, previously Hong Kong's tallest building, has been eclipsed by the 484 metre (1,588-feet) tall, 118 storey [[International Commerce Centre]] in West Kowloon, which was topped-out in 2010 and remains the tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong. Also worth mentioning is the 320 metre (1,051-feet) tall [[Nina Tower]] located in [[Tsuen Wan]].

The [[anti-Hong Kong Express Rail Link movement]] protested at the proposed Hong Kong section of the [[Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link]]; the link was nevertheless completed in 2018. The [[Hong Kong 818 incident]], inhibited by the visit of [[Li Keqiang]], caused controversy regarding civil rights violations. The [[Moral and National Education controversy]]  exemplified the conflict between [[communist]] and [[nationalist]] positions of China's government with democratic sentiments expressed by Hong Kong citizens.\n\nThe [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative council election]] saw the localists emerging as a new political force behind the [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] and [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy]] camps by winning six seats in Hong Kong's [[geographical constituencies]]. However, six candidates were [[2016 Hong Kong LegCo candidates' disqualification controversy|barred from contesting]] by the [[Electoral Affairs Commission]], due to their association with the [[Hong Kong independence]] movement. Another six localist members who were elected were disqualified in the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]. After the [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|5th Hong Kong Chief Executive Election]], Carrie Lam became the first female Chief Executive of Hong Kong. However, her proposal of the [[Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019]] has led to [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests|mass demonstrations]] against its implementation. The bill would make it legal for China to extradite criminals from Hong Kong, potentially including [[political prisoner]]s. It is feared that the bill would cause the city to open itself up to the reach of [[Law of the People's Republic of China|mainland Chinese law]] and that people from Hong Kong [[Law of Hong Kong|could become subject]] to a different legal system.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|thumb|right|150px|Flag of Hong Kong under British rule]]\n[[File:Flag of Hong Kong.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Flag of Hong Kong SAR]]]]\n{{Portal|Hong Kong}}\n* [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)]]\n* [[History of China]] ([[Timeline of Chinese history|timeline]])\n* [[History of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[British Empire]]\n* [[British nationality law and Hong Kong]]\n* [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] (1801\u20131854)\n* [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] (1768\u20131782 and 1854\u20131966)\n* [[Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs]] (1966\u20131968)\n* [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] (since 1968)\n* [[Governor of Hong Kong]]\n* [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong]]\n* [[Heritage conservation in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Museums in Hong Kong]]\n* [[History of Macau]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Butenhoff, Linda.

The media have represented the event as a period of lawlessness, loutish behaviour and unruliness.<ref name=\"snsia\"/> Some local residents and media have criticised the event due to binge drinking, and sexual promiscuity.

Fights have broken out between schoolies from one area and another<ref name=\"review\">(6 January 2003). [http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s758263.htm Schoolies Week Review]. AM. Transcript.

Yet the experiment garnered widespread condemnation when schoolie Jake Scott, a Young LNP member himself, launched a racist tirade against Indigenous Australians calling upon Australians to \"stop celebrating a culture that couldn't even the bloody wheel for god's sake\". The footage was later taken down by the youth wing of the party, but became viral within hours, forcing the party to suspend all three members involved. \n\nIn the days following the incident, [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaoxFlhy4oGz3EvkTGhWvkA Jordan Shanks], an Australian YouTube political commentator, uploaded a video satirising the actions of McGain and Riches on his channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/friendlyjordies friendlyjordies]. Shanks labelled the scandal an \"internet laughing stock\" and entitled the video \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DynNUg8uaQ SCHOOLIES IS RUINED]\". It has since been viewed over 240,000 times.\n\n==Official Schoolies events==\nOfficial Schoolies events are drug-free and alcohol-free events held at many Schoolies destinations. They include concerts, dances and parties. For all official events, attendees are required to be a registered schoolie and present a schoolie ID on entry. This schoolie ID, which at some locations includes a photo, is given to each schoolie upon registering, which requires the presentation of a current school ID and incurs a small fee. At many destinations, the official events are held in fenced-off areas or in nightclubs to prevent the infiltration of \"toolies\" and to maintain crowd control. Some events are free, while others (often those held at nightclubs) incur an entry fee.\n\n==Toolies==\nPopular schoolies (or leavers) venues are often attended by people well past school age, labelled by the media as \"''toolies''\"<ref name=\"HSun\">[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/coastal-towns-keen-to-welcome-schoolies-but-not-the-toolies/story-e6frf7jo-1225799933423 Coastal towns keen to welcome schoolies, but not the toolies].

Toolies also refers to early school leavers who are in apprenticeship training but join in the Schoolies celebrations.\n\nAnother group that have some presence at Schoolies week celebrations are those known as \"foolies\" or \"pre-schoolies\". These are adolescents who have not yet left school but still partake in activities during Schoolies week. Many organised events during Schoolies week, such as concerts, only admit those who are school leavers. On the Gold Coast in particular, Schoolies are often given wristbands as a form of identification.\n\n==Problems and risks==\nSchoolies week celebrations can involve large volumes of alcohol and other drugs such as tobacco, [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[MDMA|ecstasy]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Confrontations between participants can occur resulting in violent assaults. Other problems and risk associated with schoolies week include sexual health and sexual assault.

A 2010 study found that almost two-thirds of schoolies will consume more than ten drinks per night.<ref name=\"sgwtw\"/> The survey also revealed that most of the teenagers surveyed rated the experience negatively afterwards.\n\nMore recently laws have been changed at a Federal level increasing the tax on pre-mixed spirits, and at a state level in Queensland to focus on parents supplying alcohol to their children in an irresponsible way. [[Drink spiking]] has also been a significant problem.\n\nThe availability of drugs at Schoolies week has also been a problem {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In 2011 25% of male schoolies and 14% of females reported being [[Substance intoxication|stoned]] most or every day or night of Schoolies week.\n\n===Violence===\nSchoolies has been long known for its violence, and media reporting has often focused on schoolies violence. In the mid-1990s there were incidents where news crews handed out money for schoolies to initiate violence so they could film schoolies violence for the evening news.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  In 1996, the [[Gold Coast City Council]] began to increase regulation of events and spaces.<ref name=\"emge\">{{cite book |title=Embodied Geographies: Space, bodies and rites of passage |last=Winchester |first=Hilary P.M. |author2=Pauline M.

In subsequent years with police numbers significantly increased and innovative approaches developed, the violence has continued, but police have rapidly engaged and resolved violence. When the Queensland Government took over the management of Schoolies at the Gold Coast in 2003 from the Gold Coast City Council, after the most violent Schoolies week in 2002, their primary concern was public perceptions of Schoolies week.\n\nSchoolies destinations have been more heavily policed since, and some destinations have engaged private security guards to assist. The most significant statistic regarding violence at schoolies over the past few decades has placed the blame more so in the hands of 'toolies' than 'schoolies' themselves. Damage to hotel rooms has occurred, as well as vandalism to other private and public property.\n\n===Sex===\nSexual health has been made a focus since opportunities for [[casual sex]] at schoolies week can lead to unprotected sex and the propagation of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs). There are also concerns about sexual activity in public places such as beaches. Increases in sexual assaults during schoolies week destinations has also been a problem. A 2010 study found that one-third of males were expecting to have sex with multiple partners.<ref name=\"sgwtw\"/>\n\n==Red Frogs network==\nThe event is supported by an all-volunteer group of Christians who are recruited into the Red Frogs network.

Queensland]] in the late 1970s, in the week following final exams for private single-sex schools. The Broadbeach Hotel was the main meeting place. Schoolies Week events began to be organised for 1980, and from then on the Gold Coast attracted schoolies from all over Australia for celebrations. Since then, the tradition has spread, and Australian high-school graduates celebrate their graduation with a week-long party at many popular tourist destinations around the country.\n\nSchoolies week is considered by many teenagers in Australia as a cultural [[rite of passage]].<ref name=\"sgwtw\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/schoolies-get-what-they-want-booze-and-risky-sex-20111112-1nd2c.html |title=Schoolies get what they want: booze and risky sex |author=Jill Stark |accessdate=14 November 2011 |date=13 November 2011 |work=Brisbane Times |publisher=Fairfax Media }}</ref> Schoolies week is seen as transitional period from youth to adulthood, marking a change of state from the imposition of school discipline to the chosen freedom to have a body which is out of control.<ref name=\"emge\"/> According to the Official National Schoolies Week Website, \"The most-enduring Schoolies-week tradition is the first run down the beach and dive into the ocean after school is finished forever.

The media have represented the event as a period of lawlessness, loutish behaviour and unruliness.<ref name=\"snsia\"/> Some local residents and media have criticised the event due to binge drinking, and sexual promiscuity. Police attention is regularly required where the collective behaviour of schoolies at some locations gets out of hand, such as at [[Rottnest Island]] in 1986.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In efforts to reduce such acts, the week-long event on [[Rottnest Island]] in Western Australia has, as of 2006, been reduced to three days, which itself has resulted in a fair amount of criticism from young members of the public.\n\nIn recent years, violence (notably sexual violence) has become an increased threat to the safety of attendees. Fights have broken out between schoolies from one area and another<ref name=\"review\">(6 January 2003). [http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s758263.htm Schoolies Week Review]. AM. Transcript.

[[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Jim Keogh said that during eight days of 2009 schoolies celebrations, 217 schoolies had been arrested on 244 charges, compared with 94 schoolies arrested for the same period in 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Charges were laid against schoolies for serious assault, [[drunk and disorderly]] conduct, drug possession and obstructing police. The incidents prompted talks of banning Schoolies week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=328343 |title=More trouble at Schoolies |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |date=13 September 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605141150/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=328343 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This has led schoolies to look at safer alternatives to ensure their wellbeing.\n\n==Official Schoolies events==\nOfficial Schoolies events are drug-free and alcohol-free events held at many Schoolies destinations. They include concerts, dances and parties. For all official events, attendees are required to be a registered schoolie and present a schoolie ID on entry. This schoolie ID, which at some locations includes a photo, is given to each schoolie upon registering, which requires the presentation of a current school ID and incurs a small fee. At many destinations, the official events are held in fenced-off areas or in nightclubs to prevent the infiltration of \"toolies\" and to maintain crowd control. Some events are free, while others (often those held at nightclubs) incur an entry fee.\n\n==Toolies==\nPopular schoolies (or leavers) venues are often attended by people well past school age, labelled by the media as \"''toolies''\"<ref name=\"HSun\">[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/coastal-towns-keen-to-welcome-schoolies-but-not-the-toolies/story-e6frf7jo-1225799933423 Coastal towns keen to welcome schoolies, but not the toolies].

Toolies also refers to early school leavers who are in apprenticeship training but join in the Schoolies celebrations.\n\nAnother group that have some presence at Schoolies week celebrations are those known as \"foolies\" or \"pre-schoolies\". These are adolescents who have not yet left school but still partake in activities during Schoolies week. Many organised events during Schoolies week, such as concerts, only admit those who are school leavers. On the Gold Coast in particular, Schoolies are often given wristbands as a form of identification.\n\n==Problems and risks==\nSchoolies week celebrations can involve large volumes of alcohol and other drugs such as tobacco, [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[MDMA|ecstasy]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Confrontations between participants can occur resulting in violent assaults. Other problems and risk associated with schoolies week include sexual health and sexual assault.

A 2010 study found that almost two-thirds of schoolies will consume more than ten drinks per night.<ref name=\"sgwtw\"/> The survey also revealed that most of the teenagers surveyed rated the experience negatively afterwards.\n\nMore recently laws have been changed at a Federal level increasing the tax on pre-mixed spirits, and at a state level in Queensland to focus on parents supplying alcohol to their children in an irresponsible way. [[Drink spiking]] has also been a significant problem.\n\nThe availability of drugs at Schoolies week has also been a problem {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In 2011 25% of male schoolies and 14% of females reported being [[Substance intoxication|stoned]] most or every day or night of Schoolies week.\n\n===Violence===\nSchoolies has been long known for its violence, and media reporting has often focused on schoolies violence. In the mid-1990s there were incidents where news crews handed out money for schoolies to initiate violence so they could film schoolies violence for the evening news.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  In 1996, the [[Gold Coast City Council]] began to increase regulation of events and spaces.<ref name=\"emge\">{{cite book |title=Embodied Geographies: Space, bodies and rites of passage |last=Winchester |first=Hilary P.M. |author2=Pauline M.

In subsequent years with police numbers significantly increased and innovative approaches developed, the violence has continued, but police have rapidly engaged and resolved violence. When the Queensland Government took over the management of Schoolies at the Gold Coast in 2003 from the Gold Coast City Council, after the most violent Schoolies week in 2002, their primary concern was public perceptions of Schoolies week.\n\nSchoolies destinations have been more heavily policed since, and some destinations have engaged private security guards to assist. The most significant statistic regarding violence at schoolies over the past few decades has placed the blame more so in the hands of 'toolies' than 'schoolies' themselves. Damage to hotel rooms has occurred, as well as vandalism to other private and public property.\n\n===Sex===\nSexual health has been made a focus since opportunities for [[casual sex]] at schoolies week can lead to unprotected sex and the propagation of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs). There are also concerns about sexual activity in public places such as beaches. Increases in sexual assaults during schoolies week destinations has also been a problem. A 2010 study found that one-third of males were expecting to have sex with multiple partners.<ref name=\"sgwtw\"/>\n\n==Red Frogs network==\nThe event is supported by an all-volunteer group of Christians who are recruited into the Red Frogs network.
