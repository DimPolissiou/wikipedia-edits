It operates with 10,000 [[watt]]s in the daytime and 2,700 watts at night using a [[directional antenna]] around the clock.

It is one of the oldest radio stations in the Washington [[media market]], continuously on the air from 1925. For most of its history, the station operated as '''WMAL'''; on July 1, 2019, its [[Talk radio|talk]] programming was moved exclusively to co-owned [[WMAL-FM]] at 105.9 [[Hertz|MHz]], which had simulcast with 630 AM since 2011.\n\n==Programming==\n{{as of|2019|7}}, WSBN's programming consists of the national ESPN Radio schedule, though the station intends to produce some local programming.<ref name=\"wp-wmalamsports\">{{cite news |last1=Allen |first1=Scott |title=D.C. is getting a third sports talk radio station with the launch of ESPN 630 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/06/14/dc-is-getting-third-sports-talk-radio-station-with-launch-espn/ |accessdate=July 2, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 14, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nWMAL first went on the air on October 12, 1925, using [[Call sign|call letters]] incorporating the initials of Martin A. Leese, a local [[optician]] who began selling radio sets at 720 11th Street NW in Washington, D.C.<ref>\"A Radio for Every Purse\". (August 15, 1926). ''The Washington Post'', p. F7</ref> He started WMAL as a low-power station. The shutdown of station [[WCAP (defunct)|WCAP]] left Washington with  WRC (now [[WTEM]]) as its only high-power station, so local business leaders affiliated with the City Club of Washington banded together to create a second high-powered station. Their original plan was to buy WCAP and convert it to a municipal station, but instead they worked with Leese to boost WMAL's signal and make it the city's second large station.<ref>\"City Club to Help Develop New Radio Station in Capital\". (September 26, 1926). ''The Washington Post'', p. M13</ref> The new high-power WMAL went on the air from studios at 710-712 11th Street NW on October 2, 1926, with former WCAP announcer William T. Pierson as director and with a policy of encouraging young broadcasting talent in hopes of creating \"a people's forum\".<ref>\"New Radio Station in First Program\".  (October 3, 1926).  ''The Washington Post'', p. M14</ref>\n\nIn 1927, Leese left his optical business to focus full-time on running the station, and the following year the [[Federal Radio Commission]]'s national frequency allocation plan assigned WMAL the AM 630 frequency, which it still uses today. WMAL was a [[CBS Radio]] [[Network affiliate]] from 1928 until October 19, 1932, and then was briefly unaffiliated until joining the [[NBC Blue Network]] in January 1933. The Blue Network later became [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], with which WMAL was affiliated for many years, and which owned WMAL for several decades.\n\nBy mid-1932, M. R. Baker had been appointed manager of the station, and Kenneth H. Berkeley was appointed station director of WMAL in 1933. While still owned by the Leese family, WMAL was eventually leased to the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] in 1934, joining it with [[owned-and-operated station]] WRC.\n\nNBC's Washington vice president Frank M. Russell supervised the operation of both WMAL and WRC by 1935 when studios were moved from the National Press Building to the Trans-Lux Theatre Building, 724 14th Street NW. Transmitting facilities continued to be located at 712 Eleventh Street NW.\n\nIn the late months of 1937, the lease to NBC was terminated, with station operation reverting to the Leese Family interests. NBC, however, continued to operate it under a managerial agreement executed in fall 1937. Norman Leese was president of WMAL's licensee at that time. On May 1, 1938, the M.A. Leese Radio Corporation was acquired by publishers of the now-defunct ''[[Washington Star|Washington Evening Star]]'' [[newspaper]], a family-owned concern headed by board chairman and president Samuel H. Kauffman. Norman Leese remained president and K. H. Berkeley continued as general manager of WMAL.\n\nThe operating arrangement between NBC and the M.A. Leese Radio Corporation ended in February 1942. The station then reverted to the direct control of the Evening Star Broadcasting Company, of which K. H. Berkeley was executive vice president. Berkeley was also WMAL's general manager. In October 1947, WMAL-TV signed on as the first high-band [[VHF]] [[television]] station in the United States. It became an ABC Network affiliate a year later.\n\nBy 1946, S. H. Kauffman, president and part owner of the ''Evening Star'', was given additional duties as president of its broadcasting subsidiary, the Evening Star Broadcasting Company, until his resignation in August 1954. His replacement as general manager was Frederick S. Houwink.\n\nAlso in 1954, John W. Thompson, Jr. replaced S. H. Kauffman as president of Evening Star Broadcasting Co.\n\nAndrew Martin Ockershausen was appointed station manager of WMAL in 1960. One of Ockershausen's first moves was to team [[Frank Harden]] with [[Jackson Weaver]] for WMAL's morning drive show after the duo had a successful tryout hosting an evening comedy show patterned after [[Bob and Ray]]; ''Harden and Weaver'' took off in popularity and quickly became the top-rated morning show in the Washington market, featuring a blend of news, interviews, light music and comedy.<ref>Harden and Weaver, 1983. p. 88 & 112</ref><ref name=\"washington\">''Frank Harden Signs Off At WMAL; After 50 Years, Radio Voice Leaves With Little Fanfare'' by Marc Fisher ''The Washington Post'' January 7, 1998  [https://web.archive.org/web/20160325225807/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-647106.html Highbeam.com]</ref><ref name=\"sillier\">'' '60s Radio Days: A Sillier, Simpler Time''. Marc Fisher, ''The Washington Post'', September 13, 1999; Page A1.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Fred Houwink became a company vice president while continuing as WMAL's general manager. In 1965 Houwink was named vice president of Evening Star Broadcasting and Ockershausen was elevated to general manager of WMAL.\n\nIn 1970 Houwink retired and Ockershausen was named vice president, operations. Also in 1970 Richard S. Stakes was named general manager and Harold L. Green was named station manager. In 1974 Charles A. Macatee became WMAL's general manager.\n\n===ABC years===\nIn early January 1976, the Evening Star Broadcasting Company's WMAL, [[WLVW|WMAL-FM]] and [[WJLA|WMAL-TV]] and majority control of the ailing newspaper were acquired from the Kauffman, Noyes and Adams families by publisher [[Joe Allbritton|Joseph L. Albritton]]\u2019s Perpetual Corporation and Albritton became board chairman and chief owner of WMAL's license. On January 21, 1976, WMAL's licensee name was changed to ''Washington Star Communications of Delaware, Inc.'' Richard S. Stakes became station president, but resigned in December 1976. Mr. Albritton then assumed the presidency, with Robert Nelson becoming president of the broadcasting division. General Manager Charles Macatee resigned in January 1977.\n\nA requirement of the purchase of the Evening Star properties included the sale of the radio or television properties. In March 1977, WMAL and WMAL-FM were spun off to ABC Radio, while the TV station was retained and became [[WJLA|WJLA-TV]], named after Albritton's initials. ABC paid $16 million for WMAL and WMAL-FM, a record price for radio properties at that time. Andrew Ockershausen was appointed executive vice president.\n\n[[File:WMAL 630 old.png|left|thumb|200px|WMAL logo used until 2009.]]On January 3, 1986, [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] and [[ABC, Inc.]] merged in a $3.52 billion deal. Thomas S. Murphy was chairman and CEO of the new firm. Frederick Weinhaus became president and general manager following the resignation of Andrew Ockershausen in March 1986. Weinhaus was transferred to [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] New York in January 1988. His replacement in May 1988 was Thomas Bresnahan, who continued in that role until his retirement in 2002.\n\nWMAL morning co-host Jackson Weaver died on October 20, 1992, with ''Harden and Weaver'' still at or near the top of the local ratings; Weaver also garnered fame nationally as the first voice of [[Smokey Bear]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jackson Weaver, 72, Voice of Smokey Bear |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/22/obituaries/jackson-weaver-72-voice-of-smokey-bear.html?pagewanted=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 22, 1992 |language=en}}</ref> Frank Harden continued the morning show with co-hosts [[Tim Brant]] and Andy Parks until his retirement in 1998.<ref name=\"washington\" /> Brant and Parks continued until Brant's departure in May 2002,<ref>https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/dec/15/20031215-093650-7060r/</ref> his replacement would be former congressman [[Fred Grandy]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, WMAL transitioned its talk lineup into one similar to sister station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in New York City, with an emphasis on conservative talk.\n\n[[File:WMAL (AM) former logo (2009-2011).png|thumb|200px|WMAL logo, 2009-2011]] [[Chris Berry (broadcaster)|Chris Berry]] was named president and general manager November 19, 2002.

Plante, a popular talk host who hosted evenings and later middays, was yanked in favor of Joe Scarborough's ''[[Morning Joe]]'' in April 2009, only to return to middays six months later after Scarborough's show was cancelled.\n\nBy late 2009, WMAL's morning-drive through midnight weekday format was uninterrupted conservative talk, with a lineup of [[Fred Grandy]] and Andy Parks, [[Chris Plante]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Sean Hannity]], [[Mark Levin]], [[Joe Scarborough]], and [[Curtis Sliwa]]. Weekends include gardening host Jos Roozen, investing adviser [[Ric Edelman]] and lawyer Michael Collins. [[John Batchelor]] replaced Sliwa in November 2009. In April 2010, Parks was laid off from the station, resulting in Plante's and Grandy's shows being merged. At the same time, Scarborough's show was put on extended hiatus. Austin Hill began filling in the middays for the time being, while [[Mark Simone]] handled Scarborough's shift. Grandy left WMAL in March 2011.\n\n[[File:WMAL-AMandFM 2014.png|200px|thumb|left|Logo during simulcast with 105.9 FM, 2011\u20132019]]\nOn September 19, 2011, WMAL began simulcasting its AM signal on 105.9 FM, now [[WMAL-FM]]. The former WMAL-FM, renamed WRQX in 1977, has since become [[WLVW]]; it remained co-owned with WMAL until 2019.\n\nIn 2017, WMAL started broadcasting [[Washington Redskins]] games as an affiliate station for the first time since the team's [[Super Bowl XXVI]] win in 1992. WMAL previously carried the team's games from 1942 to 1956, and again from 1963 to 1991.

It is one of the oldest radio stations in the Washington [[media market]], continuously on the air from 1925. For most of its history, the station operated as '''WMAL'''; on July 1, 2019, its [[Talk radio|talk]] programming was moved exclusively to co-owned [[WMAL-FM]] at 105.9 [[Hertz|MHz]], which had simulcast with 630 AM since 2011.\n\n==Programming==\n{{as of|2019|7}}, WSBN's programming consists of the national ESPN Radio schedule, though the station intends to produce some local programming.<ref name=\"wp-wmalamsports\">{{cite news |last1=Allen |first1=Scott |title=D.C. is getting a third sports talk radio station with the launch of ESPN 630 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/06/14/dc-is-getting-third-sports-talk-radio-station-with-launch-espn/ |accessdate=July 2, 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 14, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nWMAL first went on the air on October 12, 1925, using [[Call sign|call letters]] incorporating the initials of Martin A. Leese, a local [[optician]] who began selling radio sets at 720 11th Street NW in Washington, D.C.<ref>\"A Radio for Every Purse\". (August 15, 1926). ''The Washington Post'', p. F7</ref> He started WMAL as a low-power station. The shutdown of station [[WCAP (defunct)|WCAP]] left Washington with  WRC (now [[WTEM]]) as its only high-power station, so local business leaders affiliated with the City Club of Washington banded together to create a second high-powered station. Their original plan was to buy WCAP and convert it to a municipal station, but instead they worked with Leese to boost WMAL's signal and make it the city's second large station.<ref>\"City Club to Help Develop New Radio Station in Capital\". (September 26, 1926). ''The Washington Post'', p. M13</ref> The new high-power WMAL went on the air from studios at 710-712 11th Street NW on October 2, 1926, with former WCAP announcer William T. Pierson as director and with a policy of encouraging young broadcasting talent in hopes of creating \"a people's forum\".<ref>\"New Radio Station in First Program\".  (October 3, 1926).  ''The Washington Post'', p. M14</ref>\n\nIn 1927, Leese left his optical business to focus full-time on running the station, and the following year the [[Federal Radio Commission]]'s national frequency allocation plan assigned WMAL the AM 630 frequency, which it still uses today. WMAL was a [[CBS Radio]] [[Network affiliate]] from 1928 until October 19, 1932, and then was briefly unaffiliated until joining the [[NBC Blue Network]] in January 1933. The Blue Network later became [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], with which WMAL was affiliated for many years, and which owned WMAL for several decades.\n\nBy mid-1932, M. R. Baker had been appointed manager of the station, and Kenneth H. Berkeley was appointed station director of WMAL in 1933. While still owned by the Leese family, WMAL was eventually leased to the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] in 1934, joining it with [[owned-and-operated station]] WRC.\n\nNBC's Washington vice president Frank M. Russell supervised the operation of both WMAL and WRC by 1935 when studios were moved from the National Press Building to the Trans-Lux Theatre Building, 724 14th Street NW. Transmitting facilities continued to be located at 712 Eleventh Street NW.\n\nIn the late months of 1937, the lease to NBC was terminated, with station operation reverting to the Leese Family interests. NBC, however, continued to operate it under a managerial agreement executed in fall 1937. Norman Leese was president of WMAL's licensee at that time. On May 1, 1938, the M.A. Leese Radio Corporation was acquired by publishers of the now-defunct ''[[Washington Star|Washington Evening Star]]'' [[newspaper]], a family-owned concern headed by board chairman and president Samuel H. Kauffman. Norman Leese remained president and K. H. Berkeley continued as general manager of WMAL.\n\nThe operating arrangement between NBC and the M.A. Leese Radio Corporation ended in February 1942. The station then reverted to the direct control of the Evening Star Broadcasting Company, of which K. H. Berkeley was executive vice president. Berkeley was also WMAL's general manager. In October 1947, WMAL-TV signed on as the first high-band [[VHF]] [[television]] station in the United States. It became an ABC Network affiliate a year later.\n\nBy 1946, S. H. Kauffman, president and part owner of the ''Evening Star'', was given additional duties as president of its broadcasting subsidiary, the Evening Star Broadcasting Company, until his resignation in August 1954. His replacement as general manager was Frederick S. Houwink.\n\nAlso in 1954, John W. Thompson, Jr. replaced S. H. Kauffman as president of Evening Star Broadcasting Co.\n\nAndrew Martin Ockershausen was appointed station manager of WMAL in 1960. One of Ockershausen's first moves was to team [[Frank Harden]] with [[Jackson Weaver]] for WMAL's morning drive show after the duo had a successful tryout hosting an evening comedy show patterned after [[Bob and Ray]]; ''Harden and Weaver'' took off in popularity and quickly became the top-rated morning show in the Washington market, featuring a blend of news, interviews, light music and comedy.<ref>Harden and Weaver, 1983. p. 88 & 112</ref><ref name=\"washington\">''Frank Harden Signs Off At WMAL; After 50 Years, Radio Voice Leaves With Little Fanfare'' by Marc Fisher ''The Washington Post'' January 7, 1998  [https://web.archive.org/web/20160325225807/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-647106.html Highbeam.com]</ref><ref name=\"sillier\">'' '60s Radio Days: A Sillier, Simpler Time''. Marc Fisher, ''The Washington Post'', September 13, 1999; Page A1.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, Fred Houwink became a company vice president while continuing as WMAL's general manager. In 1965 Houwink was named vice president of Evening Star Broadcasting and Ockershausen was elevated to general manager of WMAL.\n\nIn 1970 Houwink retired and Ockershausen was named vice president, operations. Also in 1970 Richard S. Stakes was named general manager and Harold L. Green was named station manager. In 1974 Charles A. Macatee became WMAL's general manager.\n\n===ABC years===\nIn early January 1976, the Evening Star Broadcasting Company's WMAL, [[WLVW|WMAL-FM]] and [[WJLA|WMAL-TV]] and majority control of the ailing newspaper were acquired from the Kauffman, Noyes and Adams families by publisher [[Joe Allbritton|Joseph L. Albritton]]\u2019s Perpetual Corporation and Albritton became board chairman and chief owner of WMAL's license. On January 21, 1976, WMAL's licensee name was changed to ''Washington Star Communications of Delaware, Inc.'' Richard S. Stakes became station president, but resigned in December 1976. Mr. Albritton then assumed the presidency, with Robert Nelson becoming president of the broadcasting division. General Manager Charles Macatee resigned in January 1977.\n\nA requirement of the purchase of the Evening Star properties included the sale of the radio or television properties. In March 1977, WMAL and WMAL-FM were spun off to ABC Radio, while the TV station was retained and became [[WJLA|WJLA-TV]], named after Albritton's initials. ABC paid $16 million for WMAL and WMAL-FM, a record price for radio properties at that time. Andrew Ockershausen was appointed executive vice president.\n\n[[File:WMAL 630 old.png|left|thumb|200px|WMAL logo used until 2009.]]On January 3, 1986, [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] and [[ABC, Inc.]] merged in a $3.52 billion deal. Thomas S. Murphy was chairman and CEO of the new firm. Frederick Weinhaus became president and general manager following the resignation of Andrew Ockershausen in March 1986. Weinhaus was transferred to [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] New York in January 1988. His replacement in May 1988 was Thomas Bresnahan, who continued in that role until his retirement in 2002.\n\nWMAL morning co-host Jackson Weaver died on October 20, 1992, with ''Harden and Weaver'' still at or near the top of the local ratings; Weaver also garnered fame nationally as the first voice of [[Smokey Bear]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jackson Weaver, 72, Voice of Smokey Bear |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/22/obituaries/jackson-weaver-72-voice-of-smokey-bear.html?pagewanted=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 22, 1992 |language=en}}</ref> Frank Harden continued the morning show with co-hosts [[Tim Brant]] and Andy Parks until his retirement in 1998.<ref name=\"washington\" /> Brant and Parks continued until Brant's departure in May 2002,<ref>https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/dec/15/20031215-093650-7060r/</ref> his replacement would be former congressman [[Fred Grandy]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, WMAL transitioned its talk lineup into one similar to sister station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in New York City, with an emphasis on conservative talk.\n\n[[File:WMAL (AM) former logo (2009-2011).png|thumb|200px|WMAL logo, 2009-2011]] [[Chris Berry (broadcaster)|Chris Berry]] was named president and general manager November 19, 2002.

Plante, a popular talk host who hosted evenings and later middays, was yanked in favor of Joe Scarborough's ''[[Morning Joe]]'' in April 2009, only to return to middays six months later after Scarborough's show was cancelled.\n\nBy late 2009, WMAL's morning-drive through midnight weekday format was uninterrupted conservative talk, with a lineup of [[Fred Grandy]] and Andy Parks, [[Chris Plante]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Sean Hannity]], [[Mark Levin]], [[Joe Scarborough]], and [[Curtis Sliwa]]. Weekends include gardening host Jos Roozen, investing adviser [[Ric Edelman]] and lawyer Michael Collins. [[John Batchelor]] replaced Sliwa in November 2009. In April 2010, Parks was laid off from the station, resulting in Plante's and Grandy's shows being merged. At the same time, Scarborough's show was put on extended hiatus. Austin Hill began filling in the middays for the time being, while [[Mark Simone]] handled Scarborough's shift. Grandy left WMAL in March 2011.\n\n[[File:WMAL-AMandFM 2014.png|200px|thumb|left|Logo during simulcast with 105.9 FM, 2011\u20132019]]\nOn September 19, 2011, WMAL began simulcasting its AM signal on 105.9 FM, now [[WMAL-FM]].

WMAL previously carried the team's games from 1942 to 1956, and again from 1963 to 1991.

The series aired from September 19, 2016 to January 30, 2020 on [[NBC]]. It focuses on Eleanor Shellstrop ([[Kristen Bell]]), who arrives in the [[afterlife]] and is welcomed by Michael ([[Ted Danson]]) to \"The Good Place\", a highly selective [[Heaven]]-like [[utopia]] he designed, as a reward for her [[Righteousness|righteous]] life. However, she realizes that she was sent there by mistake and must hide her morally imperfect behavior while trying to become a better and more ethical person. [[William Jackson Harper]], [[Jameela Jamil]], and [[Manny Jacinto]] co-star as other residents of \"The Good Place\", together with [[D'Arcy Carden]] as Janet, an artificial being who assists Good Place residents.\n\n''The Good Place'' has received critical acclaim for its writing, acting, originality, setting, and tone. In addition, the first season's [[twist ending]] and the show's exploration and creative use of [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]] have been positively received. The recognition earned the series a [[Peabody Award]] in 2019. The series has won two [[Hugo Awards]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]] for the episodes \"The Trolley Problem\" and \"Janet(s)\".\n\nIn December 2018, NBC renewed the series for a fourth and final season, which premiered on September 26, 2019 and concluded on January 30, 2020.<ref name=\"FinalSeason\"/><ref name=\"S4PremiereDate\"/>\n\n==Premise and synopsis==\n{{Anchor|Plot|Plot summary}}\n\nThe series is set in an [[afterlife]] in which humans are sent to the \"Good Place\" or the \"Bad Place\" after death: all humans are assigned a numerical score based on the morality of their conduct in life. Only those with the very highest scores are sent to the Good Place, where they enjoy eternal happiness with their every wish granted, guided by an [[artificial intelligence]] named Janet; all else experience an eternity of torture in the Bad Place. \n\nIn [[The Good Place (season 1)|the first season]], amoral loner Eleanor and small-time criminal Jason believe that they have been sent to the Good Place incorrectly. Eleanor's assigned [[soulmate]], Chidi, a [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]], attempts to teach them ethics so they can earn their presence there. Jason's soulmate, wealthy socialite Tahani, attempts to help Michael, the kindly designer of their neighborhood, deal with the chaos apparently caused by Eleanor and Jason's presence. Eventually, Eleanor realizes that the four humans have actually been in an experimental Bad Place all along, chosen by Michael to torture each other emotionally and psychologically for eternity.\n\nIn [[The Good Place (season 2)|the second season]], Michael repeatedly erases the humans' memories to try to restart their psychological torture, but they figure out the truth each time. Eventually they persuade him to take their side and attempt to get them into the Good Place for real. Michael appeals their case to the eternal Judge, who rules that the humans may be returned to their lives on Earth, with no memory of the afterlife, to attempt to prove their moral development.\n\nBack on Earth in [[The Good Place (season 3)|the third season]], the group participates in a research study led by Chidi and his colleague Simone. Once they learn the truth about the afterlife, they try to help others improve their moral behavior. Eventually they discover that no one has been admitted to the Good Place in centuries. They propose that the points system is fundamentally flawed and set up an experimental simulated Good Place to test their thesis that humans can develop morally with proper support. \n\nIn [[The Good Place (season 4)|the final season]], the year-long experiment eventually proves that humans can show moral improvement in the afterlife. The group institutes a new system whereby deceased humans will earn their way into the Good Place by passing tests of moral development; and then, to avoid becoming numbed by the ennui of eternal bliss, humans may choose to exit the Good Place and peacefully end their afterlife. In the final episode, Jason, Chidi, and Eleanor eventually choose to exit; Tahani becomes a designer of afterlife environments, and Michael is allowed to be sent to Earth to live as a human.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n[[File:Kristen Bell at The 35th Annual Saturn Awards.jpg|thumb|[[Kristen Bell]] portrays series protagonist Eleanor Shellstrop.]]\n[[File:'The Good Place' cast and crew visit San Diego Comic Con for a panel (43768257142).jpg|thumb|The cast of ''The Good Place'' at the 2018 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Eleanor Shellstrop, a deceased selfish saleswoman from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], who seemingly winds up in the Good Place by mistake.

Did its finale measure up?|last=VanDerWerff|first=Emily Todd|date=2020-01-31|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe beginning of ''The Good Place'' takes its inspiration from the idiom \"Hell is other people\", from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s play ''[[No Exit]]''. In the play, three people are trapped in Hell, represented as one room, and they torture one another psychologically while reflecting upon the sins that got them there.<ref name=\"vox\" /> The concept \"Hell is other people\" is an often-misunderstood philosophical idiom meant to reflect that \"Hell is other people because you are, in some sense, forever trapped within them, subject to their apprehension of you.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ambrosino |first=Brandon |title=Hell is other people ... misquoting philosophers |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7229547/philosophy-quotes-misunderstood-wittgenstein-sartre-descartes |website=Vox |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"den of geek\">{{cite web |last=Mellor |first=Louisa |title=The 1944 Existentialist Play That Inspired The Good Place |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-good-place/275396/the-1944-existentialist-play-that-inspired-the-good-place |website=Den of Geek |date=August 4, 2018 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe play ''No Exit'' acts as a direct inspiration for ''The Good Place's'' first season where it is revealed that the human-loving Good Place architect, Michael, is a demon sent from Hell to run an experiment on the idea that humans are their own best torturers. He selectively chooses a group of four people who he decides are perfectly offset to torture one another and, in the beginning, it appears to work. Chidi tortures Eleanor with his indecisiveness, inflexibility, and scholarly disposition; likewise Eleanor tortures Chidi by constantly putting him in situations where he must make decisions or go against the very moral tenets he espouses. Tahani tortures Eleanor by continuously reinforcing her superiority, Jason tortures Tahani by being unable to return her incessant need for validation (as he is initially the silent Buddhist monk Jianyu), and for Jason the mere fact he is forced to pretend he is someone other than himself is torture in itself. Each character is designed to bring out what they hate most about each other and themselves, resulting in the new form of torture Michael is experimenting with.<ref name=\"den of geek\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |title=Critic's Notebook: Twisty 'Good Place' Finale Sets Up a Second Season That NBC Needs to Order |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/good-place-finale-critics-notebook-966705 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 4, 2018 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe second philosophical inspiration of ''The Good Place'' is the question of whether studying moral philosophy can have a direct effect on how moral one can be. In season two, Chidi becomes a teacher to Eleanor, Jason, Tahani and the demon, Michael. The show does not definitively answer this question, as Eleanor often struggles to decide which moral philosophy is best to abide by in her situations, but the lessons do encourage the process of self-reflection. By encouraging Eleanor to reflect on the moral implications of an act, her challenges encourage moral her to develop her capacity to see her choices as moral ones.  Morality is also created in Michael not through Chidi's lessons, which Michael uses as a means of torture but, rather, through the relationships he develops with the characters.<ref>{{cite video |last=Pickard |first=Claire |title=The Philosophy of The Good Place \u2013 Wisecrack Edition |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds |website=YouTube |publisher=[[Wisecrack (company)|Wisecrack]] |date=September 22, 2018 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe final major philosophical tenet of the show is named in one of the series' episodes, \"What We Owe to Each Other\", which is a philosophy book written by Tim Scanlon. According to the show's head writer Michael Schur, this \"book forms the spine of the entire show\".<ref name=\"vox\" /> The book presents the idea of [[Contractualism]]: the idea is that \"to act morally is to abide by principles that no one could reasonably reject\".<ref name=\"vox\"/> The show and the relationships between the characters act as an investigation into contractualism with the four main humans, Michael, and Janet forming their own society whereby they must act in ways that no one could reasonably reject even when that goes against the rules and tenets of higher powers. The overarching thesis of the show, greatly influenced by the contractualist theory is \"the point of morality... isn't to accumulate goodness points, as in the elaborate point system the organizers of ''The Good Place'' and its corresponding Bad Place employ to determine who goes to which upon death. It's to live up to our duties to each other.\"<ref name=\"vox\" />\n\n==''The Selection''==\nIn September 2019, prior to the release of the fourth season of ''The Good Place'', [[NBC]] released a six-episode [[web series]] on their website, app, and their [[YouTube]] channel, titled ''The Selection'', directed by [[Eric Kissack]]. The series, set during an [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] taking place during the season 3 episode \"Chidi Sees the Time-Knife\", follows Michael's former demon boss Shawn as he and his underlings decide which four people to pick for Michael's new incarnation of \"the Good Place\". [[Marc Evan Jackson]], Josh Siegal, [[Bambadjan Bamba]], [[Amy Okuda]], and [[Jama Williamson]] form the main cast by reprising their roles from ''The Good Place'' as Shawn and his underlings, with [[Joe Mande]] reprising his role as Toddrick \"Todd\" Hemple in the third episode.<ref>{{cite web

television series created by [[Michael Schur]]. The series aired from September 19, 2016 to January 30, 2020 on [[NBC]]. It focuses on Eleanor Shellstrop ([[Kristen Bell]]), who arrives in the [[afterlife]] and is welcomed by Michael ([[Ted Danson]]) to \"The Good Place\", a highly selective [[Heaven]]-like [[utopia]] he designed, as a reward for her [[Righteousness|righteous]] life. However, she realizes that she was sent there by mistake and must hide her morally imperfect behavior while trying to become a better and more ethical person. [[William Jackson Harper]], [[Jameela Jamil]], and [[Manny Jacinto]] co-star as other residents of \"The Good Place\", together with [[D'Arcy Carden]] as Janet, an artificial being who assists Good Place residents.\n\n''The Good Place'' has received critical acclaim for its writing, acting, originality, setting, and tone. In addition, the first season's [[twist ending]] and the show's exploration and creative use of [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]] have been positively received. The recognition earned the series a [[Peabody Award]] in 2019. The series has won two [[Hugo Awards]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]] for the episodes \"The Trolley Problem\" and \"Janet(s)\".\n\nIn December 2018, NBC renewed the series for a fourth and final season, which premiered on September 26, 2019 and concluded on January 30, 2020.<ref name=\"FinalSeason\"/><ref name=\"S4PremiereDate\"/>\n\n==Premise and synopsis==\n{{Anchor|Plot|Plot summary}}\n\nThe series is set in an [[afterlife]] in which humans are sent to the \"Good Place\" or the \"Bad Place\" after death: all humans are assigned a numerical score based on the morality of their conduct in life. Only those with the very highest scores are sent to the Good Place, where they enjoy eternal happiness with their every wish granted, guided by an [[artificial intelligence]] named Janet; all else experience an eternity of torture in the Bad Place. \n\nIn [[The Good Place (season 1)|the first season]], amoral loner Eleanor and small-time criminal Jason believe that they have been sent to the Good Place incorrectly. Eleanor's assigned [[soulmate]], Chidi, a [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]], attempts to teach them ethics so they can earn their presence there. Jason's soulmate, wealthy socialite Tahani, attempts to help Michael, the kindly designer of their neighborhood, deal with the chaos apparently caused by Eleanor and Jason's presence. Eventually, Eleanor realizes that the four humans have actually been in an experimental Bad Place all along, chosen by Michael to torture each other emotionally and psychologically for eternity.\n\nIn [[The Good Place (season 2)|the second season]], Michael repeatedly erases the humans' memories to try to restart their psychological torture, but they figure out the truth each time. Eventually they persuade him to take their side and attempt to get them into the Good Place for real. Michael appeals their case to the eternal Judge, who rules that the humans may be returned to their lives on Earth, with no memory of the afterlife, to attempt to prove their moral development.\n\nBack on Earth in [[The Good Place (season 3)|the third season]], the group participates in a research study led by Chidi and his colleague Simone. Once they learn the truth about the afterlife, they try to help others improve their moral behavior. Eventually they discover that no one has been admitted to the Good Place in centuries. They propose that the points system is fundamentally flawed and set up an experimental simulated Good Place to test their thesis that humans can develop morally with proper support. \n\nIn [[The Good Place (season 4)|the final season]], the year-long experiment eventually proves that humans can show moral improvement in the afterlife. The group institutes a new system whereby deceased humans will earn their way into the Good Place by passing tests of moral development; and then, to avoid becoming numbed by the ennui of eternal bliss, humans may choose to exit the Good Place and peacefully end their afterlife. In the final episode, Jason, Chidi, and Eleanor eventually choose to exit; Tahani becomes a designer of afterlife environments, and Michael is allowed to be sent to Earth to live as a human.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n[[File:Kristen Bell at The 35th Annual Saturn Awards.jpg|thumb|[[Kristen Bell]] portrays series protagonist Eleanor Shellstrop.]]\n[[File:'The Good Place' cast and crew visit San Diego Comic Con for a panel (43768257142).jpg|thumb|The cast of ''The Good Place'' at the 2018 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Eleanor Shellstrop, a deceased selfish saleswoman from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], who seemingly winds up in the Good Place by mistake.

research|section|date=February 2020}}\n''The Good Place'' makes use of many different theories of [[moral philosophy]] and ethics through the character of Chidi Anagonye, the moral philosophy professor. Within the show, there is reference to [[John Locke]], [[Tim Scanlon]], [[Peter Singer]], and [[Derek Parfit]], and \"the show has covered everything from [[Jonathan Dancy]]'s theory of [[moral particularism]], to [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian virtue ethics]], to [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]], to [[moral nihilism]].\"<ref name=\"vox\">{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |title=How The Good Place taught moral philosophy to its characters \u2014 and its creators |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/26/20874217/the-good-place-season-premiere-season-4-moral-philosophy |website=Vox |date=September 26, 2019 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref> UCLA philosophy professor, [[Pamela Hieronymi]], served as a consultant to the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/how-ucla-philosophy-professor-pamela-hieronymi-helped-construct-the-good-place |title=How a UCLA philosophy professor helped construct \u2018The Good Place\u2019 |website=UCLA Newsroom |first=Jessica |last=Wolf |date=October 3, 2018 |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref> She also made a cameo alongside political philosopher, [[Todd May]], in the final episode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/31/21116261/the-good-place-series-finale-recap-whenever-youre-ready-season-4-door|title=The Good Place was groundbreaking TV. Did its finale measure up?|last=VanDerWerff|first=Emily Todd|date=2020-01-31|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe beginning of ''The Good Place'' takes its inspiration from the idiom \"Hell is other people\", from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s play ''[[No Exit]]''. In the play, three people are trapped in Hell, represented as one room, and they torture one another psychologically while reflecting upon the sins that got them there.<ref name=\"vox\" /> The concept \"Hell is other people\" is an often-misunderstood philosophical idiom meant to reflect that \"Hell is other people because you are, in some sense, forever trapped within them, subject to their apprehension of you.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ambrosino |first=Brandon |title=Hell is other people ... misquoting philosophers |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7229547/philosophy-quotes-misunderstood-wittgenstein-sartre-descartes |website=Vox |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"den of geek\">{{cite web |last=Mellor |first=Louisa |title=The 1944 Existentialist Play That Inspired The Good Place |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-good-place/275396/the-1944-existentialist-play-that-inspired-the-good-place |website=Den of Geek |date=August 4, 2018 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe play ''No Exit'' acts as a direct inspiration for ''The Good Place's'' first season where it is revealed that the human-loving Good Place architect, Michael, is a demon sent from Hell to run an experiment on the idea that humans are their own best torturers. He selectively chooses a group of four people who he decides are perfectly offset to torture one another and, in the beginning, it appears to work. Chidi tortures Eleanor with his indecisiveness, inflexibility, and scholarly disposition; likewise Eleanor tortures Chidi by constantly putting him in situations where he must make decisions or go against the very moral tenets he espouses. Tahani tortures Eleanor by continuously reinforcing her superiority, Jason tortures Tahani by being unable to return her incessant need for validation (as he is initially the silent Buddhist monk Jianyu), and for Jason the mere fact he is forced to pretend he is someone other than himself is torture in itself. Each character is designed to bring out what they hate most about each other and themselves, resulting in the new form of torture Michael is experimenting with.<ref name=\"den of geek\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |title=Critic's Notebook: Twisty 'Good Place' Finale Sets Up a Second Season That NBC Needs to Order |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/good-place-finale-critics-notebook-966705 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 4, 2018 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe second philosophical inspiration of ''The Good Place'' is the question of whether studying moral philosophy can have a direct effect on how moral one can be. In season two, Chidi becomes a teacher to Eleanor, Jason, Tahani and the demon, Michael. The show does not definitively answer this question, as Eleanor often struggles to decide which moral philosophy is best to abide by in her situations, but the lessons do encourage the process of self-reflection. By encouraging Eleanor to reflect on the moral implications of an act, her challenges encourage moral her to develop her capacity to see her choices as moral ones.  Morality is also created in Michael not through Chidi's lessons, which Michael uses as a means of torture but, rather, through the relationships he develops with the characters.<ref>{{cite video |last=Pickard |first=Claire |title=The Philosophy of The Good Place \u2013 Wisecrack Edition |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds |website=YouTube |publisher=[[Wisecrack (company)|Wisecrack]] |date=September 22, 2018 |accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe final major philosophical tenet of the show is named in one of the series' episodes, \"What We Owe to Each Other\", which is a philosophy book written by Tim Scanlon. According to the show's head writer Michael Schur, this \"book forms the spine of the entire show\".<ref name=\"vox\" /> The book presents the idea of [[Contractualism]]: the idea is that \"to act morally is to abide by principles that no one could reasonably reject\".<ref name=\"vox\"/> The show and the relationships between the characters act as an investigation into contractualism with the four main humans, Michael, and Janet forming their own society whereby they must act in ways that no one could reasonably reject even when that goes against the rules and tenets of higher powers. The overarching thesis of the show, greatly influenced by the contractualist theory is \"the point of morality... isn't to accumulate goodness points, as in the elaborate point system the organizers of ''The Good Place'' and its corresponding Bad Place employ to determine who goes to which upon death. It's to live up to our duties to each other.\"<ref name=\"vox\" />\n\n==''The Selection''==\nIn September 2019, prior to the release of the fourth season of ''The Good Place'', [[NBC]] released a six-episode [[web series]] on their website, app, and their [[YouTube]] channel, titled ''The Selection'', directed by [[Eric Kissack]]. The series, set during an [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] taking place during the season 3 episode \"Chidi Sees the Time-Knife\", follows Michael's former demon boss Shawn as he and his underlings decide which four people to pick for Michael's new incarnation of \"the Good Place\". [[Marc Evan Jackson]], Josh Siegal, [[Bambadjan Bamba]], [[Amy Okuda]], and [[Jama Williamson]] form the main cast by reprising their roles from ''The Good Place'' as Shawn and his underlings, with [[Joe Mande]] reprising his role as Toddrick \"Todd\" Hemple in the third episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/09/the-good-place-preps-final-season-with-the-selection-digital-series-1202734356/ |title=\u2018The Good Place\u2019 Preps Viewers For Its Final Season With \u2018The Selection\u2019 Digital Series |website=Deadline |first=Bruce |last=Haring |date=September 13, 2019 |accessdate=September 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|display=''The Good Place''|d=Q22908690|c=category:The Good Place|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|wikt=no|s=no|species=no}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n\n{{Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form}}\n{{TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy}}\n{{authority control|WORLDCATID=}} <!-- empty value to suppress WorldCat Identities link that 404s -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Good Place, The}}\n[[Category:The Good Place| ]]\n[[Category:2010s American comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2016 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Angels in television]]\n[[Category:Demons in television]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fantasy comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Fiction about memory erasure and alteration]]\n[[Category:Fiction about the afterlife]]\n[[Category:Heaven in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Hell in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Hugo Award-winning television series]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award-winning television programs]]\n[[Category:Philosophical fiction]]\n[[Category:Philosophy and culture]]\n[[Category:Philosophy television series]]\n[[Category:Television series about parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Television series by 3 Arts Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremulon]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:Television shows about death]]\n[[Category:Television shows featuring audio description]]\n[[Category:Television shows filmed in California]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Mepl1988", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMain", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place"}

The song was part of the Marilyn Manson song pack that became available on July 25, 2017.\n\n==Background==\nManson told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'': \"I've always had these dreams about making a girl out of all these pieces of prosthetic limbs, and then taking my own hair and teeth that I saved from when I was a kid and very ritualistically creating this companion.\" Those dreams were the inspiration for \"Tourniquet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sympathy-for-the-devil-marilyn-manson-19970123|title=Marilyn Manson: Sympathy for the Devil|author=Strauss, Neil|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 23, 1997|accessdate=January 13, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423144646/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sympathy-for-the-devil-marilyn-manson-19970123|archivedate=April 23, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"Tourniquet\" is a [[gothic rock]] song<ref name=goth/> with a length of four minutes and thirty seconds.<ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/tourniquet-mw0000378056|title=Tourniquet \u2013 Marilyn Manson |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=January 24, 2017}}</ref> It begins with the [[backmasking|backwards]] message \"This is my lowest point of vulnerability\".<ref name=loudwire>{{cite magazine| url=http://loudwire.com/best-marilyn-manson-songs/| last=Heartmann| first=Graham| title=10 Best Marilyn Manson Songs| magazine=[[Loudwire]]| date=January 5, 2013| accessdate=December 26, 2017| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727221155/http://loudwire.com/best-marilyn-manson-songs/| archivedate=July 27, 2016}}</ref> Like many Marilyn Manson songs from the first three albums, some of the lyrics to this song were previously a poem [[Marilyn Manson|Manson]] had written prior to the formation of the band.

Deborah joined [[King's College London]] as Director, Cultural Partnerships in 2012. In 2015 she was appointed as the university's Assistant Principal (London) and in 2018 was named Vice President & Vice-Principal (London).\n\nBorn in [[Derby]], and brought up in [[Kent]] and [[Lincolnshire]], she studied dance from the age of seven, first locally, and then, on the recommendation of her teacher, at the [[Royal Ballet School]]. Whilst at the school she won the 1980 [[Prix de Lausanne]], the prestigious international ballet competition.\n\n== Ballet career ==\nShe was invited to join [[The Royal Ballet]] in 1981, having toured with the company as a student during the summer. The teachers that Bull identified as the \"resident teachers\" were [[Brian Shaw]], [[Alexander Agadzhanov]], [[Betty Anderton]] and the Norwegian [[Gerd Larsen]]. Bull particularly admired Larsen's ability to introduce mime.<ref name=bull>{{cite book|last=Bull|first=Deborah|title=Everyday dancer|date=2011|isbn=0571260942|pages=19\u201320|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0571260942}}</ref> Bull was promoted through the ranks and gained principal status in 1992, immediately following the company's opening performance in Japan, at which she danced the role of Gamzatti in La Bayadere.\n\nDuring her twenty years in The Royal Ballet, she danced a wide range of work throughout the repertoire. Her leading roles in the classics included Odette/Odile in ''Swan Lake'', Aurora in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and Kitri in ''Don Quixote'', and she created roles for [[Ashley Page]], [[David Bintley]], [[Michael Corder]], Emma Diamond, [[Wayne McGregor]], [[Glen Tetley]] and [[Twyla Tharp]]. She received particular praise for her performances in the works of [[George Balanchine]] and [[William Forsythe (choreographer)|William Forsythe]]. In 1995 Forsythe staged for her the first performance in this country of his ballet ''Steptext'', and she was subsequently nominated for a 1996 Olivier Award in the 'Outstanding Achievement In Dance' Category for her interpretation. She was named as 1996 Dancer of the Year by both ''The Sunday Express'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'', who praised her work both on and off the stage, saying 'here is a dancer whose intelligence and courage - for once - don't reside entirely in the tips of her toes'.\n\nAway from The Royal Ballet, she toured Italy, North America and Canada with [[Wayne Eagling]]'s group, 'Stars of the Royal Ballet', and was invited to join [[Irek Mukhamedov]] for the debut performances of his company 'Irek Mukhamedov and Friends' in 1992. She danced at the 1993 and 1995 Harrogate International Festival, and in April 1996 was invited to perform in the first 'Diamonds of World Ballet' Gala at the Kremlin Palace, Moscow. She has toured Japan with Tetsuya Kumakawa and in the summers of 1994 and 1995 she organised, staged and starred in ''An Evening of British Ballet'' at the Sintra Festival in Portugal. In March 2001, she was invited to star in the triple bill Nijinsky Ritrovato at the Rome Opera House, dancing the Chosen Maiden in ''Rite of Spring'' and alongside Carla Fracci in ''Jeux''.\n\n== Artists\u2019 Development Initiative ==\nIn addition to her work with The Royal Ballet, she founded in 1998 the Artists\u2019 Development Initiative at the Royal Opera House, a programme designed to open up the resources and expertise within the theatre to small-scale companies and independent artists. Over its first two years, ADI worked with over 250 artists from outside the Royal Opera House and facilitated collaborations across art forms and between independent choreographers and classical dancers. ADI shared the 2001 ''Time Out'' Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance with [[Wayne McGregor]] for Symbiont(s), premiered in the Clore Studio Upstairs in June 2000.\n\n== ROH2 ==\nShe retired from The Royal Ballet in August 2001 to take up a new position at the Royal Opera House in January 2002, as Creative Director, [[ROH2]], developing a range of small-scale and experimental artistic initiatives and overseeing the programme in the theatre's alternative performance spaces. In 2004, her remit expanded to include the delivery of a strategy for the ROH's work away from the main stage, including an alternative performance programme, opera and dance development initiatives, Big Screen live relays from the main stage, an \u2018On the Road\u2019 programme and daytime activities in the building. In addition, she managed ROH Collections, the Royal Opera House's extensive archives, and was focused on the organisation's Olympic planning and audience engagement strategies. In 2008, she was made Creative Director of the Royal Opera House, a post she held until 2012.\n\n== Publishing ==\nIn addition to her work as a dancer, she has regularly written and lectured on the arts. In January 1996 she debated at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion 'This House Believes the National Lottery Gives Too Much Money to the Elitist Arts'. Her address was described by [[Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie|Lord Gowrie]], her debating partner, as 'the best speech I have heard on the Arts in 30 years'. The motion was heavily defeated, a triumph which the ''Evening Standard'' attributed largely to 'the eloquence of a ballerina, unaccustomed to public speaking', describing her speech as 'cogently argued and delivered with generosity of spirit'.\n\nIn October 1996 she was invited by Lord Gowrie to deliver the Arts Council Annual Lecture at the Royal Society for the Arts, 'From Private Patronage to Public Purse'.\n\nShe has written articles for ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', ''[[Classic FM Magazine]]'', ''[[New Statesman]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'', and reviewed for ''The Telegraph'', ''[[The Literary Review]]'' and several dance magazines. From 1999 to 2001 she wrote a regular column, Private View, for ''The Telegraph''.\n\nAside from the Arts, she has a passionate interest in health and fitness, and has taught nutrition to the students of the Royal Ballet School as well as chairing the [[Prix de Lausanne]]\u2019s annual seminars on dance related health matters.\n\nShe has published three books. ''The Vitality Plan'', ([[Dorling Kindersley]], January 1998) was published simultaneously in the United States as ''Totally Fit'', and has since been translated into seven different languages. ''Dancing Away'' ([[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], October 1998) is a diary of The Royal Ballet's first year \u2018on the road\u2019, as the Royal Opera House underwent its extensive and controversial redevelopment. To mark publication, Deborah was commissioned to read five extracts from the book on [[BBC Radio 4]]. ''Dancing Away'' was described by ''[[The Spectator]]'' as \u2018arguably the most amusing and fascinating dance book ever published\u2019. ''The Faber Pocket Guide to Ballet'', jointly with Luke Jennings, was published in 2004, describing important historical and repertoire ballets with a 'View from the Wings' by Bull of her personal thoughts on dancing in a piece. A second book for [[Faber and Faber|Faber]]'', The Everyday Dancer'', appeared in 2011.\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n===Television===\nHer first programme for television, ''Dance Ballerina, Dance'', was screened at Christmas 1998 as part of BBC 2's ''Dance Night'', an evening devoted entirely to dance which she co-presented along with the comedian [[Alexei Sayle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/dance-event-of-the-week-dance-night-monday-bbc2-1194361.html|title=Dance; Event of the week - Dance Night, Monday BBC2|date=26 December 1998|newspaper=Independent|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> ''Travels With My Tutu'', written and presented by Bull, was screened over Christmas 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/522e03cc9d994257b7d2127400192385|title=Travels with My Tutu - BBC Two England - 15 December 2000 - BBC Genome|publisher=[[BBC Genome Project]]|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> This four part BBC2 series explored breakdance, jive, belly dance and tango and attracted record audiences.\n\nShe has presented live on [[BBC Two]] from the Royal Opera House (''[[Copp\u00e9lia]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e197134e70604860861530a6027b6598|title=Copp\u00e9lia - BBC Two England - 19 February 2000 - BBC Genome|publisher=[[BBC Genome Project]]|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> and ''The Nutcracker'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cfd8ed9746884d49b345be09ed0458fd|title=The Royal Ballet in The Nutcracker - BBC Two England - 30 December 2000 - BBC Genome|publisher=[[BBC Genome Project]]|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> both in 2000) and from [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]] (Rambert Dance Company), as well as a live [[The Proms|Proms]] performance on [[BBC One]] in 2004.

Deborah joined [[King's College London]] as Director, Cultural Partnerships in 2012. In 2015 she was appointed as the university's Assistant Principal (London) and in 2018 was named Vice President & Vice-Principal (London).\n\nBorn in [[Derby]], and brought up in [[Kent]] and [[Lincolnshire]], she studied dance from the age of seven, first locally, and then, on the recommendation of her teacher, at the [[Royal Ballet School]]. Whilst at the school she won the 1980 [[Prix de Lausanne]], the prestigious international ballet competition.\n\n== Ballet career ==\nShe was invited to join [[The Royal Ballet]] in 1981, having toured with the company as a student during the summer. The teachers that Bull identified as the \"resident teachers\" were [[Brian Shaw]], [[Alexander Agadzhanov]], [[Betty Anderton]] and the Norwegian [[Gerd Larsen]]. Bull particularly admired Larsen's ability to introduce mime.<ref name=bull>{{cite book|last=Bull|first=Deborah|title=Everyday dancer|date=2011|isbn=0571260942|pages=19\u201320|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0571260942}}</ref> Bull was promoted through the ranks and gained principal status in 1992, immediately following the company's opening performance in Japan, at which she danced the role of Gamzatti in La Bayadere.\n\nDuring her twenty years in The Royal Ballet, she danced a wide range of work throughout the repertoire. Her leading roles in the classics included Odette/Odile in ''Swan Lake'', Aurora in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' and Kitri in ''Don Quixote'', and she created roles for [[Ashley Page]], [[David Bintley]], [[Michael Corder]], Emma Diamond, [[Wayne McGregor]], [[Glen Tetley]] and [[Twyla Tharp]]. She received particular praise for her performances in the works of [[George Balanchine]] and [[William Forsythe (choreographer)|William Forsythe]]. In 1995 Forsythe staged for her the first performance in this country of his ballet ''Steptext'', and she was subsequently nominated for a 1996 Olivier Award in the 'Outstanding Achievement In Dance' Category for her interpretation. She was named as 1996 Dancer of the Year by both ''The Sunday Express'' and ''The Independent on Sunday'', who praised her work both on and off the stage, saying 'here is a dancer whose intelligence and courage - for once - don't reside entirely in the tips of her toes'.\n\nAway from The Royal Ballet, she toured Italy, North America and Canada with [[Wayne Eagling]]'s group, 'Stars of the Royal Ballet', and was invited to join [[Irek Mukhamedov]] for the debut performances of his company 'Irek Mukhamedov and Friends' in 1992. She danced at the 1993 and 1995 Harrogate International Festival, and in April 1996 was invited to perform in the first 'Diamonds of World Ballet' Gala at the Kremlin Palace, Moscow. She has toured Japan with Tetsuya Kumakawa and in the summers of 1994 and 1995 she organised, staged and starred in ''An Evening of British Ballet'' at the Sintra Festival in Portugal. In March 2001, she was invited to star in the triple bill Nijinsky Ritrovato at the Rome Opera House, dancing the Chosen Maiden in ''Rite of Spring'' and alongside Carla Fracci in ''Jeux''.\n\n== Artists\u2019 Development Initiative ==\nIn addition to her work with The Royal Ballet, she founded in 1998 the Artists\u2019 Development Initiative at the Royal Opera House, a programme designed to open up the resources and expertise within the theatre to small-scale companies and independent artists. Over its first two years, ADI worked with over 250 artists from outside the Royal Opera House and facilitated collaborations across art forms and between independent choreographers and classical dancers. ADI shared the 2001 ''Time Out'' Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance with [[Wayne McGregor]] for Symbiont(s), premiered in the Clore Studio Upstairs in June 2000.\n\n== ROH2 ==\nShe retired from The Royal Ballet in August 2001 to take up a new position at the Royal Opera House in January 2002, as Creative Director, [[ROH2]], developing a range of small-scale and experimental artistic initiatives and overseeing the programme in the theatre\u2019s alternative performance spaces. In 2004, her remit expanded to include the delivery of a strategy for the ROH's work away from the main stage, including an alternative performance programme, opera and dance development initiatives, Big Screen live relays from the main stage, an \u2018On the Road\u2019 programme and daytime activities in the building. In addition, she managed ROH Collections, the Royal Opera House's extensive archives, and was focused on the organisation\u2019s Olympic planning and audience engagement strategies. In 2008, she was made Creative Director of the Royal Opera House, a post she held until 2012.\n\n== Publishing ==\nIn addition to her work as a dancer, she has regularly written and lectured on the arts. In January 1996 she debated at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion 'This House Believes the National Lottery Gives Too Much Money to the Elitist Arts'. Her address was described by [[Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie|Lord Gowrie]], her debating partner, as 'the best speech I have heard on the Arts in 30 years'. The motion was heavily defeated, a triumph which the ''Evening Standard'' attributed largely to 'the eloquence of a ballerina, unaccustomed to public speaking', describing her speech as 'cogently argued and delivered with generosity of spirit'.\n\nIn October 1996 she was invited by Lord Gowrie to deliver the Arts Council Annual Lecture at the Royal Society for the Arts, 'From Private Patronage to Public Purse'.\n\nShe has written articles for ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', ''[[Classic FM Magazine]]'', ''[[New Statesman]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'', and reviewed for ''The Telegraph'', ''[[The Literary Review]]'' and several dance magazines. From 1999 to 2001 she wrote a regular column, Private View, for ''The Telegraph''.\n\nAside from the Arts, she has a passionate interest in health and fitness, and has taught nutrition to the students of the Royal Ballet School as well as chairing the [[Prix de Lausanne]]\u2019s annual seminars on dance related health matters.\n\nShe has published three books. ''The Vitality Plan'', ([[Dorling Kindersley]], January 1998) was published simultaneously in the United States as ''Totally Fit'', and has since been translated into seven different languages. ''Dancing Away'' ([[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], October 1998) is a diary of The Royal Ballet's first year \u2018on the road\u2019, as the Royal Opera House underwent its extensive and controversial redevelopment.

His father Louis was born in [[Leeds]] to where the family had emigrated, and became a doctor; his mother came from the rabbinical Palterovich family who had emigrated to Leeds in 1895 (Taylor was therefore a distant cousin of actress [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]). Taylor had a brother, Arthur, and a sister, Dorothy. By the time of his birth, the family were living in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]; Taylor passed the 11-plus and attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]]. During [[World War II]], Newcastle was subject to bombing raids and Taylor was evacuated to [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] where he lived in a house without either running water or mains electricity. He had three daughters:  Ruth, Deborah and Judith; and a son Louis.\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1951 Taylor won an exhibition to [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], to study law. He was also a talented pianist, continuing to play for the whole of his life. He graduated in 1953 with an upper second class degree and then read for the Bar, being [[call to the bar|called]] in 1954. He chose to practise on the north-eastern circuit around Newcastle and joined the chambers of Norman Harper. He conducted mainly criminal cases, often for the prosecution, and at a very early age 'took silk' to become a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1967; he occasionally appeared for the defence and on one such occasion, the reactionary judge [[Melford Stevenson]] deemed him a threat to the administration of justice.\n\n==Famous cases==\nTaylor attracted attention from 1973 when he appeared for the prosecution in several cases connected to the corrupt architect [[John Poulson]], including that of Poulson himself. Over the next three years, the prosecutions succeeded and many of those involved were jailed. In 1974, Taylor successfully prosecuted [[Judith Ward]] who was convicted of a series of IRA bombings (many years later, the conviction was found to have been a miscarriage of justice, mostly through Ward's delusions of her own guilt). He also prosecuted [[Stefan Kiszko]] in July 1976, in what would become one of the most notorious miscarriages of justice in British Law in the 20th Century. Taylor also took on [[John Ryman]], a fellow Barrister and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Blyth Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Blyth Valley]] who was found to have submitted fraudulent election expenses.\n\nThe most high-profile trial in which Taylor appeared took place in 1979 and the defendant was former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] who was accused of conspiracy to murder. Although all involved were acquitted, most observers put this down to the summing-up of the trial judge and the malpractice of the prosecution witnesses; Taylor won praise for his handling of the case. His opening address is frequently quoted; Taylor's style of oratory was deliberately concise and straightforward but he had a talent for a punning literary allusion.\n\n==Judge==\nTaylor had been first appointed a recorder (part-time judge) in 1969 and served as a recorder in the Crown Court from 1972. After serving as Chairman of the Bar Council for 1979\u201380, he was made a full High Court judge in the Queen's Bench Division, receiving the customary [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=48384 |date=28 November 1980 |page=16524}}</ref> One of his first cases saw him give [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley London Borough Council]] permission to challenge the [[Greater London Council]]'s \"Fare's Fair\" policy of lowering public transport fares. In 1983 Taylor held that a [[Pakistan]]i man who had pronounced [[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]] and notified the authorities in Pakistan had not [[divorce]]d his wife according to English law.\n\nIn 1984, Taylor largely sided with [[Mary Whitehouse]] who brought a case against the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] over the feature film version of ''[[Scum (film)|Scum]]'' (1979); he said the Director-General of the IBA had made \"a grave error of judgment\" in allowing the film to be shown. The next year, he held that Nottinghamshire police had acted negligently in firing [[CS gas]] into a house knowing there would be a fire risk and not having fire engines on standby. In 1987 he stated that he did not accept that a judge could not inquire further when a minister raised a justification of 'national security' for their actions (the case concerned the [[telephone tapping]] of [[Joan Ruddock]]).\n\n==Court of Appeal==\nIn 1988 Taylor was promoted to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. There he became known to the public on 17 April 1989 when he was commissioned by the government to undertake an inquiry into the [[Hillsborough disaster]] two days previously. The [[Taylor Report]] he produced led to the introduction of [[all-seater stadium]] at all top English football clubs, and the removal of fences around fans sitting areas. Standing accommodation was seen as a risk due to the increased chances of a \"crush\", and the security fences which Taylor describes as treating spectators like \"prisoners of war\" were also a hazard in crushes as they claimed the lives of most of the 96 people who ultimately lost their lives at Hillsborough; 94 of them died on the day of the disaster, a 95th died several days later, and the final victim died in March 1993 having never regained consciousness.<ref>[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&SrchText=Hillsborough&edn=&DateFromDD=17&DateFromMM=Apr&DateFromYY=1989&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortOrder=asc&SortOrder=asc&SortOrder=asc&SortSpec=&DateToDD=21&DateToMM=Apr&ResultListMax=200&Submit1=Search&source=thetimes&DateToYY=1989&byline=&head=&Collection=NI%C2%A7%3D&Caption=&SortField=SDate&SortField=Pub&SortField=EDN&SortField=Page&ST=NS&Site=ALL&ResultCount=20&BackDD=Day&summreqd=yes&QueryText=(Hillsborough)+%3CAND%3E+(PUB%3DBOTH)+%3CAND%3E+((SDate%3E%3D4%2F17%2F1989)+%3CAND%3E+(SDate%3C%3D4%2F21%2F1989))&BackMM=Month&indexkey=29D8117191423728026E160&advsrch=0&BackYY=Year&_P=3&ResultMaxDocs=200&]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTaylor's recommendations, published on 29 January 1990, stated that all First and Second Division (which became the [[Premier League]] and Division One in 1992) stadiums had to be all-seater by August 1994, and that the rest of the [[Football League]] should follow suit by August 1999. However, [[the Football Association]] later ruled that the smaller clubs could retain standing accommodation provided that their stadiums met safety requirements, while clubs promoted to the upper reaches of the league would be allowed standing accommodation at their stadiums for up to three years after [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]].\n\nTaylor's popularity as a former Chairman of the Bar Council and as a fair judge who could plausibly claim to have been in touch with all aspects of British life led to his being considered the favourite to take over from [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]] when Lane retired from the job of [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], a retirement which seemed all the more likely due to the criticism of Lane for his stance on a succession of miscarriages of justice. Taylor was duly appointed when Lane stepped down in 1992, at the same time being created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Taylor of Gosforth''', ''of [[Embleton, Northumberland|Embleton]] in the [[County of Northumberland]]'' on 27 April 1992.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=52908 |date=30 April 1992 |page=7533}}</ref>\n\n==Lord Chief Justice==\nWhere Lane had been extremely reticent about giving interviews, Taylor was determined to be as open as possible. Not only did he start his tenure by holding an unprecedented press conference, he appeared as a guest on [[BBC]] television's ''[[Question Time (television)|Question Time]]'' and as a castaway on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. Within a few months of taking over he accepted an invitation to give the annual [[Richard Dimbleby Lecture|Dimbleby Lecture]] on \"The judiciary in the nineties\" in which he cast himself as a reformer. He supported moves to stop Judges wearing wigs in court.\n\nUnlike previous holders of the office, Taylor concentrated almost exclusively on appeals rather than acting as a trial judge. This was partly because a backlog had grown up but also because of the much increased concern over a series of cases going back many years which were being proved to be miscarriages of justice. Taylor differed from his immediate predecessor in considering this an immensely serious issue, and knew from his own experience of prosecuting Judith Ward and [[Stefan Kiszko]] that many more cases could come to light. This led him to strong support of the full disclosure of prosecution evidence (he also supported moves towards disclosure of defence evidence).\n\nTaylor was with the grain of public opinion in supporting stronger sentences on [[drink driving|drunk drivers]] who killed, and he also extended the range of defences available to [[domestic violence]] victims who fought back. He also extended the concept of murder to include the abortion of unborn children in their mother's womb. Because of his unusual openness, his view was often heard on matters of political controversy: he could live with the change to allow juries to draw adverse inferences from defendant's silence when interviewed, but opposed moves restricting the right of an accused to elect trial by jury.\n\n==Illness==\nTaylor was profoundly affected by the death of his wife Irene in 1995. Shortly afterwards he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. The last appeal he heard was that of [[Rosemary West]], which he turned down. He stepped down in 1996, although did not go quietly: in a series of speeches in the [[House of Lords]] over the next year he strongly attacked proposals from the then [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], [[Michael Howard]], to introduce mandatory sentencing, which he said \"must involve a denial of justice\". He died from cancer in 1997 aged 66 at his home in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1997/05/01/world/lord-taylor-of-gosforth-is-dead-chief-english-appeals-judge-66.html?referer=https://www.google.com/|title=Lord Taylor of Gosforth Is Dead; Chief English Appeals Judge, 66|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 May 1997}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070523194121/http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/lmfreemencit?opendocument#justice Honour from the City of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]\n*[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&sText=Peter+Taylor&LinkID=mp06506&rNo=0&role=sit Portrait of Taylor] at the [[National Portrait Gallery (England)|National Portrait Gallery]], London\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-legal}}\n{{succession box | before=[[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|The Lord Lane]] | title=[[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice of England]] | years=1992\u20131996 | after=[[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|The Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taylor, Peter, Baron Taylor of Gosforth}}\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:Crossbench life peers]]\n[[Category:English judges]]\n[[Category:Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales]]\n[[Category:British Jews]]\n[[Category:People from Newcastle upon Tyne]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:People educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne]]\n[[Category:Queen's Bench Division judges]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Jewish British politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{other people||Peter Taylor (disambiguation){{!}}Peter Taylor}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n{{Infobox judge\n| honorific-prefix = [[The Right Honourable]]\n| name        = The Lord Taylor of Gosforth\n| honorific-suffix = {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|Kt|PC|}}\n| image       = Lord Taylor of Gosforth 1993.jpg\n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| office      = [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice of England]]\n| term_start  = 27 April 1992\n| term_end    = 4 June 1996\n| nominator   = [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|The Lord Mackay of Clashfern]]\n| appointer   = [[Elizabeth II]]\n| predecessor = [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|The Lord Lane]]\n| successor   = [[Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|The Lord Bingham of Cornhill]]\n| office2     = Lord Justice of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]]\n| term_start2 = 1988\n| term_end2   = 1992\n| nominator2  =\n| appointer2  = [[Elizabeth II]]\n| birth_name         = Peter Murray Taylor\n| birth_date         = {{Birth date|1930|5|1}}\n| birth_place        = [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England\n| death_date         = {{Death date and age|1997|4|28|1930|5|1}}\n| death_place = Guildford, England\n| nationality        = British\n| spouse             = Irene Harris Taylor (d. 1995)\n| relations          = [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] (distant cousin)\n| children           = Ruth Taylor<br>Deborah Taylor<br>Judith Taylor<br>Louis Taylor\n| parents            = Louis Taylor (father)\n| education          = [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]]\n| alma_mater         = [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]]\n| awards             = [[Knight Bachelor]]<br>[[Life Peer]]\n}}\n\n'''Peter Murray Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|Kt|PC|}} (1 May 1930 \u2013 28 April 1997) was the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice of England]] from 1992 until 1996.\n\n==Family==\nTaylor came from a [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[Jew]]ish family who had emigrated to England from [[Marijampol\u0117]] and [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]; the original name of the family was Teiger or Teicher. His father Louis was born in [[Leeds]] to where the family had emigrated, and became a doctor; his mother came from the rabbinical Palterovich family who had emigrated to Leeds in 1895 (Taylor was therefore a distant cousin of actress [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]). Taylor had a brother, Arthur, and a sister, Dorothy. By the time of his birth, the family were living in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]; Taylor passed the 11-plus and attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]]. During [[World War II]], Newcastle was subject to bombing raids and Taylor was evacuated to [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] where he lived in a house without either running water or mains electricity. He had three daughters:  Ruth, Deborah and Judith; and a son Louis.\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1951 Taylor won an exhibition to [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], to study law. He was also a talented pianist, continuing to play for the whole of his life. He graduated in 1953 with an upper second class degree and then read for the Bar, being [[call to the bar|called]] in 1954. He chose to practise on the north-eastern circuit around Newcastle and joined the chambers of Norman Harper. He conducted mainly criminal cases, often for the prosecution, and at a very early age 'took silk' to become a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1967; he occasionally appeared for the defence and on one such occasion, the reactionary judge [[Melford Stevenson]] deemed him a threat to the administration of justice.\n\n==Famous cases==\nTaylor attracted attention from 1973 when he appeared for the prosecution in several cases connected to the corrupt architect [[John Poulson]], including that of Poulson himself. Over the next three years, the prosecutions succeeded and many of those involved were jailed. In 1974, Taylor successfully prosecuted [[Judith Ward]] who was convicted of a series of IRA bombings (many years later, the conviction was found to have been a miscarriage of justice, mostly through Ward's delusions of her own guilt). He also prosecuted [[Stefan Kiszko]] in July 1976, in what would become one of the most notorious miscarriages of justice in British Law in the 20th Century. Taylor also took on [[John Ryman]], a fellow Barrister and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Blyth Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Blyth Valley]] who was found to have submitted fraudulent election expenses.\n\nThe most high-profile trial in which Taylor appeared took place in 1979 and the defendant was former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] who was accused of conspiracy to murder. Although all involved were acquitted, most observers put this down to the summing-up of the trial judge and the malpractice of the prosecution witnesses; Taylor won praise for his handling of the case. His opening address is frequently quoted; Taylor's style of oratory was deliberately concise and straightforward but he had a talent for a punning literary allusion.\n\n==Judge==\nTaylor had been first appointed a recorder (part-time judge) in 1969 and served as a recorder in the Crown Court from 1972. After serving as Chairman of the Bar Council for 1979-80, he was made a full High Court judge in the Queen's Bench Division, receiving the customary [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=48384 |date=28 November 1980 |page=16524}}</ref> One of his first cases saw him give [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley London Borough Council]] permission to challenge the [[Greater London Council]]'s \"Fare's Fair\" policy of lowering public transport fares. In 1983 Taylor held that a [[Pakistan]]i man who had pronounced [[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]] and notified the authorities in Pakistan had not [[divorce]]d his wife according to English law.\n\nIn 1984, Taylor largely sided with [[Mary Whitehouse]] who brought a case against the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] over the feature film version of ''[[Scum (film)|Scum]]'' (1979); he said the Director-General of the IBA had made \"a grave error of judgment\" in allowing the film to be shown. The next year, he held that Nottinghamshire police had acted negligently in firing [[CS gas]] into a house knowing there would be a fire risk and not having fire engines on standby. In 1987 he stated that he did not accept that a judge could not inquire further when a minister raised a justification of 'national security' for their actions (the case concerned the [[telephone tapping]] of [[Joan Ruddock]]).\n\n==Court of Appeal==\nIn 1988 Taylor was promoted to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. There he became known to the public on 17 April 1989 when he was commissioned by the government to undertake an inquiry into the [[Hillsborough disaster]] two days previously. The [[Taylor Report]] he produced led to the introduction of [[all-seater stadium]] at all top English football clubs, and the removal of fences around fans sitting areas. Standing accommodation was seen as a risk due to the increased chances of a \"crush\", and the security fences which Taylor describes as treating spectators like \"prisoners of war\" were also a hazard in crushes as they claimed the lives of most of the 96 people who ultimately lost their lives at Hillsborough; 94 of them died on the day of the disaster, a 95th died several days later, and the final victim died in March 1993 having never regained consciousness.<ref>[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&SrchText=Hillsborough&edn=&DateFromDD=17&DateFromMM=Apr&DateFromYY=1989&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortOrder=asc&SortOrder=asc&SortOrder=asc&SortSpec=&DateToDD=21&DateToMM=Apr&ResultListMax=200&Submit1=Search&source=thetimes&DateToYY=1989&byline=&head=&Collection=NI%C2%A7%3D&Caption=&SortField=SDate&SortField=Pub&SortField=EDN&SortField=Page&ST=NS&Site=ALL&ResultCount=20&BackDD=Day&summreqd=yes&QueryText=(Hillsborough)+%3CAND%3E+(PUB%3DBOTH)+%3CAND%3E+((SDate%3E%3D4%2F17%2F1989)+%3CAND%3E+(SDate%3C%3D4%2F21%2F1989))&BackMM=Month&indexkey=29D8117191423728026E160&advsrch=0&BackYY=Year&_P=3&ResultMaxDocs=200&]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTaylor's recommendations, published on 29 January 1990, stated that all First and Second Division (which became the [[Premier League]] and Division One in 1992) stadiums had to be all-seater by August 1994, and that the rest of the [[Football League]] should follow suit by August 1999.
