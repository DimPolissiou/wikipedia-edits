The motion of the rod is termed elliptical motion. The semi-axes ''a'' and ''b'' of the ellipses have lengths equal to the distances from the point on the rod to each of the two pivots. \n\nThe straight lines described by the pivots are special cases of an ellipse, where the length of one axis is twice the distance between the pivots and that of the other is zero. All points on a circle with a diameter defined by the two pivots reciprocate in such straight lines. This circle corresponds to the smaller circle in a [[Tusi_couple|Tusi couple]].\n\nThe point midway between the pivots orbits in a circle around the point where the channels cross. This circle is also a special case of an ellipse. Here the axes are of equal length. The diameter of the circle is equal to the distance between the pivots. The direction of travel around the orbit is opposite to the sense of rotation of the trammel. Thus, if a crank centred on the crossing point of the channels is used to engage the trammel at the midway point to drive it, the rotation of the crankpin and the trammel are equal and opposite, which in practical applications results in extra friction and accelerated wear. This is compounded by high forces owing to the short throw of the crank of only 1/4 the travel of the pivots.\n \nAn '''[[ellipsograph]]''' is a trammel of Archimedes intended to draw, cut, or machine ellipses, e.g. in [[wood]] or other sheet materials.  An ellipsograph has the appropriate instrument (pencil, knife, [[wood router|router]], etc.) attached to the rod.  Usually the [[distances]] ''a'' and ''b'' are adjustable, so that the size and shape of the ellipse can be varied.\n\nThe history of such ellipsographs is not certain, but they are believed to date back to [[Proclus]] and perhaps even to the time of [[Archimedes]].<ref name=AMM/>\n\nWooden versions of the trammel of Archimedes have been produced also as [[toy]]s or [[novelty item]]s, and sold under the name of '''[[Kentucky]] do-nothings''', '''nothing grinders''', '''do nothing machines''', or '''bullshit grinders'''.  In these toys  the drafting instrument is replaced by a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] handle, and the position of the sliding shuttles is usually fixed.\n\n== Mathematics ==\n{{Gallery\n |align=center\n |title=Concept\n |File:Archimedes Trammel.gif|Trammel of Archimedes as [[ellipsograph]].\n |File:Archimedes Trammel Diagram.png|Diagram]]\n |File:Archimedes_trammel_loci.svg|link={{filepath:Archimedes_trammel_loci.svg}}|Loci of some points along and beyond a trammel of Archimedes, the green \ncircle being the loci of its midpoint &ndash; [{{filepath:Archimedes_trammel_loci.svg}} in the SVG file,] move the pointer over the diagram to move the trammel\n |File:Trammel of Archimedes with three sliders.gif|Trammel of Archimedes with three sliders\n}}\nLet ''C'' be the outer end of the rod, and ''A'', ''B'' be the pivots of the sliders.

A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

(''[[n\u00e9e]]'' '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup.

The types were known as '''amphtrack''', \"amtrak\", \"amtrac\", etc. ([[portmanteau]]s of \"amphibious tractor\"), and \"alligator\" or \"gator\".\n\n== Development ==\n=== The Alligator===\nThe LVT had its origins in a civilian rescue vehicle called the ''Alligator''. Developed by [[Donald Roebling]] in 1935, the Alligator was intended to operate in swampy areas, inaccessible to both traditional cars and boats. Two years later, Roebling built a redesigned vehicle with improved water speed. The [[United States Marine Corps]], which had been developing [[amphibious warfare]] doctrine based on the ideas of [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lt. Col]] [[Earl Hancock Ellis|Earl Hancock \"Pete\" Ellis]] and others, became interested in the machine after learning about it through an article in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] and convinced Roebling to design a more seaworthy model for military use.<ref name=nip>{{cite journal |last=Seese |first=Robert J. |year=1983 |title=The Roebling Alligator |journal=[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]] |volume=109 |issue=12 |page=27 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nBoth the US Navy and Roebling resisted the idea of a military design, the US Navy because it felt conventional landing craft could do the job, and Roebling because he wished his invention to be used only for peaceful purposes. Roebling was persuaded after war broke out in Europe, and completed a militarized prototype by May 1940. The Bureau of Ships requested a second prototype with a more powerful engine, and the USMC tested the design in November 1940. Impressed by the second prototype, the Bureau of Ships placed a contract for production of 100 units of a model using all-steel construction, for a more rugged and easily produced design, and the first LVT-1 was delivered in July 1941. Another 200 units were ordered even before the first production units were delivered. After more improvements to meet requirements of the Navy, made difficult by Roebling's lack of blueprints for the initial designs, the vehicle was adopted as \"Landing Vehicle Tracked\" or LVT.<ref name=nip/>\n\n===The LVT-1 design===\nThe contract to build the first 200 LVTs was awarded to the [[Food Machinery Corporation]] (FMC), a manufacturer of [[insecticide]] spray pumps and other farm equipment, which built some parts for the Alligators. The initial 200 LVTs were built at FMC's [[Dunedin, Florida]] factory, where most of the improvement work had been done as well. The first production LVT rolled out of the plant in July, 1941.<ref name=nip/> Later, wartime LVT production was expanded by FMC and the Navy to four factories, including the initial facility in Dunedin; the new facilities were located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], [[Riverside, California]], and [[San Jose, California]].\n\nThe LVT-1 could carry 18 fully equipped men or {{convert|4,500|lb}} of cargo.<ref>''The complete guide to tanks and armoured fighting vehicles'', p. 314, {{ISBN|978-1-84681-110-4}}, {{ISBN|1-84681-110-4}}</ref> Originally intended to carry replenishment from ships to shore, they lacked [[vehicle armour|armor protection]] and their tracks and suspension were unreliable when used on hard terrain. However, the Marines soon recognized the potential of the LVT as an assault vehicle. A battalion of LVTs was ready for 1st Marine Division by 16 February 1942. The LVTs saw their first operational use in Guadalcanal, where they were used exclusively for landing supplies. About 128 LVTs were available for the landings.\n\n=== LVT-2 Buffalo and other developments===\nAs early as January 1940, Roebling had prepared preliminary sketches of an LVT with a gun turret to provide fire support to the landing waves. The concept languished until June 1941, when USMC recommended development of an LVT armed with a 37mm gun and three machine guns and armored against 0.50 (12.7mm) machine gun fire. Development was slow and ultimately involved a complete redesign of the LVT, the LVT-2 Buffalo. Armored versions were introduced as well as fire support versions, dubbed ''Amtanks'', which were fitted with turrets from [[Stuart tank|Stuart series light tanks]] (LVT(A)-1) and [[Howitzer Motor Carriage M8]]s (LVT(A)-4).\n\nAmong other upgrades were a new powerpack (engine and cooling accessories), also borrowed from the Stuarts, and a rubber \"torsilastic\" [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] which improved performance on land. After Borg-Warner evaluated the LVT-1, Borg-Warner and FMC began work on new designs. FMC was assisted by faculty from Caltech and the University of California and developed the designs that became the LVT-2 and the LVT(A)-1. Interest in the LVT was enough that the Secretary of the Navy formed the Continued Board for the Development of the Landing Vehicle Tracked on 30 October 1943.\n\nProduction continued throughout the war, resulting in 18,616 LVTs delivered. 23 US Army and 11 USMC battalions were equipped by 1945 with LVTs. British and Australian armies also used LVTs in combat during World War II.\n\nIn the late 1940s, a series of prototypes were built and tested, but none reached production stage due to lack of funding. Realizing that acquisition of new vehicles was unlikely, the Marines modernized some of the LVT-3s and LVT(A)-5s and kept them in service until the late 1950s.\n\n==Combat history==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\n\n=== Guadalcanal===\nUSMC LVT-1s were mainly used for logistical support at [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]]. LVT-1 proved in this campaign its tactical capabilities, versatility and potential for amphibious operations.\n[[File:LVT amphibian tractors move toward the beach on Guadalcanal in August 1942.jpg|thumb|LVT-1 move toward the beach on Guadalcanal. The [[USS President Hayes (APA-20)|USS ''President Hayes'' (AP-39)]] is seen in the background.]]\nAs LVT-1s were unarmed, the Marines decided to arm them using any available machine gun. Each one was armed with three .30-caliber machine guns (sometimes water-cooled models) and a .50-caliber machine gun. Organization of LVTs of the Amphibian Tractor Battalions for the assault:\n* Company \"A\" of 1st Battalion with thirty LVT-1 was assigned to the [[5th Marine Regiment|5th Marines]] which was to land on Guadalcanal.\n* A platoon of LVT-1s would go ashore on [[Tulagi]] assigned to 2nd Marine Battalion.{{citation needed||date=August 2019}}\n* Company \"B\" was assigned to the [[1st Marine Regiment]].\n* The remainder of the 1st Battalion remained with the [[1st Marine Division|1st Division]]'s support group.\n* Company \"A\" of the 2nd Battalion was assigned to [[2nd Marine Regiment]], the landing force reserve.\n\n===Tarawa===\nIn the [[Battle of Tarawa|amphibious assault on Tarawa]] in late 1943, the LVTs were first used for amphibious assault in order to negotiate the barrier reef and arrive to the most heavily defended beaches the Americans ever met in the Pacific. This was also the first use of the LVT-2 Water Buffalo in combat. [[2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion|2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion]] LVTs took part in the first, second, and third waves of landings and carried the continuous supply of ammunition, reinforcements, and ferrying back of the wounded. Of 125 vehicles used (50 new LVT-2s and 75 LVT-1s), only 35 remained operational by the end of the first day, continuing to ferry men and supplies across the coral reef and through the shallows to the beach.\n\n[[File:Tank at Tarawa.jpg|thumb|Disabled LVTs and a [[Type 95 Ha-Go|Type 95 light tank]] on Tarawa.]]\n\nThe 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion had only about 79 LVT-1s and 50 LVT-2s (directly shipped from San Diego) available for the assault. Most of the troops had to disembark from [[LCVP (United States)|LCVP]] \"Higgins boats\" and wade across the reef chest-deep or higher water while under heavy enemy fire. American casualties were very heavy and many who made to the beach alive had lost their [[rifle]]s and other essential gear.\n\n=== Developments in the Pacific===\nAfter Tarawa, many changes were made. The USMC recommended that a battalion of armored LVTs, two companies of [[DUKW]]s and two battalions of cargo LVTs be assigned to each division in future amphibious operations. The number of LVTs by battalion was increased to 300; before Tarawa it was 100. Due to mechanical reliability problems after every landing, the Marines replaced all LVTs used in operations.\n\nAs a result of Tarawa experience, standardized armor kits were provided for the LVTs to be used in contested landings. Other improvements were made in the damage repair area, machine gun shields, and in the LVT design to increase crew and LVT survivability.\n\nThe gun-armed \"amtank\" LVT(A)-1 and LVT(A)-4 were developed to provide fire support. Armed with a 75mm howitzer, the latter was introduced in 1944 just before the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas campaign]] and was especially effective in this role as it was capable of destroying Japanese fortifications as it came ashore. Its howitzer complemented the 75mm gun of the [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] used by the Marines. However, the LVT(A)-4 had an open-topped turret which left the crew vulnerable to artillery and infantry attack, especially to the latter, as it lacked any sort of machine gun armament. The lack of machine gun armament was eventually rectified, though the open-topped turret remained in order to save weight. Although usually used in a direct role during landings only (once inland the \"amtanks\" were assigned to artillery formations to augment their firepower), in the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas campaign]] \"amtanks\" were employed inland, much like regular tanks.\n\n=== Bougainville ===\nIn November 1943, US Marines [[Bougainville Campaign|landed on the island of Bougainville]]. 29 LVTs were landed on the first day, with a total of 124 LVTs operating with the Marines during the landing.\n\n=== Marshall Islands===\nIn the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|campaign for the Marshall Islands,]] the full range of the LVT models became available, including armed Amtrac LVTs based on the proven LVT-2 with a tank gun turret. This provided close-in firepower as the cargo LVTs neared the beach. The combination of armoured cargo LVT-2 and the armed LVT(A)-1 together helped to capture the Marshalls far ahead of schedule.\n\n=== Saipan===\n[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] saw the massive use of the LVTs by the USMC with six battalions of cargo LVT, including the new ramped LVT-4, and two battalions of armored Amtracs, employing the new LVT(A)-4 with a 75&nbsp;mm howitzer.\n\n===Tinian===\n[[File:LVT-2 doodlebug.jpg|thumb|LVT-2 doodlebug in testing on Saipan]]\nAt [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]] a field variant of the LVT-2 was created by the [[Seabees]] of the 3rd Battalion [[18th Marines]] and 3rd Battalion [[20th Marines]].<ref name=\"Tinian\">Seabees and doodlebugs at Tinian, This date in Seabee History July 24 1944, Seabee Museum website, Port Hueneme, CA[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/museums/seabee/explore/online-reading-room/seabee-faqs/the-doodlebugs.html]</ref> V Amphibious Corps chose beaches abutted by [[coral]] embankments up to 15 feet. \nThe Japanese thought the embankments the beaches unsuitable for a landing. The [[Civil Engineer Corps|CB engineers]] constructed detachable ramps mounted on LVTs to make such an assault possible.<ref name=\"Tinian\"/> Salvaging iron beams from the damaged sugar factory on Saipan they fabricated 10 assault vehicles.<ref name=\"Tinian\"/> The commanding Marine General was skeptical and ordered a vehicle go up and down a ramp 100 times before approving their use in combat. The Tinian assault was a success.  The defenders were quickly overwhelmed compromising the remainder of the defences.<ref name=\"Tinian\"/>  The Seabees named their LVTs \"doddlebugs\".<ref name=\"Tinian\"/>\n\n===Peleliu===\nFrom the [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu campaign]] on, a number of LVTs were fitted with a [[flamethrower]] for use against fortifications. The LVT was usually flanked by a pair of gun tanks for protection. A number of LVTs were converted to armored ambulances carrying a [[Physician|doctor]] and three [[Hospital corpsman|corpsmen]]. LVTs were also employed as guide boats for tanks unloading onto submerged reefs.\n\n===Leyte===\nThe largest use of LVTs{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} was in the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte landing]] in October 1944, with nine US Army amtrac and two amtank [[battalion]]s deployed by [[Sixth United States Army|US Army 6th Army]]. These US Army LVTs were later used in other [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippine islands]] landings.<ref>[http://www.natread.com/node/3 The 788th Amphibian Tractor Battalion]</ref> 54 LVT(4) tracked amphibious assault vehicles of the 672nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion as part of the raiding force on 23 February 1945 forged across Laguna de Bay and crashed the gates during the [[Raid on Los Ba\u00f1os|liberation of Los Ba\u00f1os Internment Camp]]. They ferried the weakened liberated civilians back behind the lines during the contested withdrawal.\n\n===Iwo Jima===\nThe LVT-4 played a crucial role both as the assault vehicle to carry troops and as the chief logistical vehicle in the first days of [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]. Ashore, the LVTs were used to rescue wheeled vehicles that could not navigate [[Iwo Jima]]'s soft volcanic ash and steep terraces. In addition, American troops used the LVTs to transport casualties from the front lines to evacuation sites on the beaches. The 75&nbsp;mm howitzer on the LVT-4 provided important fire support as the Marines slowly advanced across the island.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/IV/index.html | title=HyperWar: USMC Operations in WWII: Vol IV--Western Pacific Operations}}</ref>\n\n===Okinawa===\nThis was the largest landing in the Central Pacific drive. The new LVT-3, a redesign of internal arrangements, was used successfully through the long [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]]. Over 1000 LVTs took part in the [[Battle of Okinawa]].\n\n===Europe===\nIn Europe, LVTs were mainly used for landings and river crossing operations as well as assaults in swampy zones. By the end of 1943, 200 LVT-1s had been delivered to the British Army for training in preparation for future operations in Europe. The U.S., [[British Army|British]], and [[Canadian Army|Canadian armies]] used the Buffalo in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]] (1944), during the [[Operation Plunder|Operation ''Plunder'']] crossing of the [[Rhine]], along the [[Po River]] in Italy, across the river Elbe, and in a number of other river crossing operations.\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B11628.jpg|thumb|Buffalo amphibians during the invasion of Walcheren Island, November 1944.]]\nLVTs were used in the [[Normandy landings]], but their use by the United States was limited as the US Army doctrine in Europe viewed the [[DD tank|Sherman DD]] as the answer to assault on heavily defended beaches. LVT-2s were used to help unload supplies after the landings on [[Utah Beach]] from the cargo ships off the coast to the beach and through the nearby swamps.\n\nFor the Rhine crossing, the British [[21st Army Group]] had some 600 Buffalos available, most of them used to transport the assault infantry. As mud was expected to hamper the Sherman DD tanks, some LVTs were armed with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon and two machine guns to give fire support until bridges could be constructed across the river. The \"Specials\" were assigned to the [[79th Armoured Division]] (which operated all specialist assault vehicles), that also provided Buffalos fitted with [[Churchill_tank#Churchill_AVRE_(Assault_Vehicle_Royal_Engineers)|\"Bobbin\" carpets]] to create temporary roadways over the mud.\n\nThe US Army used LVT-2s and LVT-4s in Europe in small numbers in 1944-45 for river crossing operations. LVT-2s and LVT-4s were used by US troops on the [[Operation Grenade|Roer River crossing]] in 1945. US Army LVT-4's were also used by [[752nd Tank Battalion]] to ferry [[88th Infantry Division (United States)|88th Infantry Division]] troops across the [[Po (river)|Po River]] in [[Italy]] in April 1945.\n\nFive LVT-4s were supplied through [[Lend-Lease]] to the [[Red Army|Soviet Red Army]], which used them when assaulting the well-defended west banks of the [[Oder]] and [[Danube]] rivers.\n\n===North Africa===\nThe first operational use of the LVT in North Africa was in November 1942. A small number of LVT-1s were used during the landings on the coast of North Africa during [[Operation Torch]]. Four LVT-1s and two bulldozers were assigned to each shore party engineer company. Their tasks were towing vehicles and boat salvage operations. LVT-1s proved useful in getting stranded landing craft afloat, but they also experienced many mechanical failures.\n\n===South East Asia===\nSome of the reconnaissance units of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fourteenth Army]] in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] operated LVT-1s. Although originally planned to fight against the Japanese on the Burmese coast at the end of 1943, this part of the operations plan was cancelled and no LVT-1s were used in combat.\n\nIn 1945, the [[Royal Marines]] Amphibious support unit was created. Its LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s supported Royal Marines landings in Burma and Malaya.\n\n===Post WWII===\nSome LVT-3s, LVT-3Cs, and modified LVT(A)-5s saw action in the [[Korean War]]. The [[French Army]] used the U.S.-supplied LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s in the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]] and in the [[Suez Crisis]].\n[[File:LSD-22-Fort-Marion-LVT-korea.jpg|thumb|LVTs embarking Royal Marine commandos leave Fort Marion (LSD-22) for the beach at Sorye Dong, North Korea, on 7 April 1951.]]\nDuring the Korean War, LVT(3)Cs and LVT(A)s were used for the [[Battle of Inchon|landing in Incheon]] and subsequent [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]  crossing to re-take Seoul. It was also used in the [[Hungnam evacuation|evacuation of Hungnam]] Harbour when Chinese forces attacked. The LVT(3)C was used by USMC in Korea as both an amphibious vehicle, and in the role of an armored personnel carrier while on land.\n\nNationalist China (ROC) forces used some US-provided LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s during [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] against [[People's Liberation Army|communist Chinese troops]]. Many were captured by communist Chinese forces, with at least several dozen refitted with a Soviet ZiS-2 57&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun in place of the original US 75&nbsp;mm howitzer-gun following their successful capture of mainland China from the Chinese Nationalists in 1949.\n\nFrench armored units developed the use of amphibious tracked vehicles in Indochina: The amphibious C model of the [[M29 Weasel]] (armed either with [[FM 24/29 light machine gun|Chaterrault M1924/29]], [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] or [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning M1919]] machine guns and with [[M18 recoilless rifle|57mm M18A1]] recoilless guns),{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=24}} LVT-4s (equipped with two M2 and two M1919 machine guns, and sometimes equipped with [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40mm Bofors guns]]{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=25}} or 57&nbsp;mm recoilless guns){{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=24}} and LVT(A)-4 (with 75&nbsp;mm howitzer) were used to great effect by ''[[1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment|1er R\u00e9giment Etrangers de Cavalerie]]''.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=33}} In 1950, the French Army received a number of LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s from the US to supplement M29Cs.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=17}} In September 1951, the first French mixed unit (''1er Groupement Autonome'') was created, consisting of two squadrons of Weasels (33 each), three squadrons of LVT-4 (11 each) and one fire support platoon of 6 LVT(A)-4. Later a second group was created in [[Tonkin]] when more LVTs were received. Both these groups participated in [[Mekong Delta|Mekong]] and [[Red River delta]] operations and in landing operations on Vietnam shores.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=18}} The {{ill|1er r\u00e9giment de chasseurs \u00e0 cheval|fr|1er r\u00e9giment de chasseurs \u00e0 cheval (France)}} also deployed a platoon of LVTs.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=29}} LVTs were known as \"alligators\" in French armed forces.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=17}}\n\nDuring the [[Suez crisis|1956 Suez Canal crisis]], [[40 Commando|40]] and [[42 Commando]] of the [[Royal Marines]] made a landing in [[Port Said]] using their available LVTs, supported by a number of [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion tanks]] from the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The [[French Navy]] assigned 13 LVT-4s to the Force H, to be used by the ''1\u00e8re compagnie du [[1st Foreign Parachute Regiment|1er R.E.P.]]'' and ''3eme Marine Commando'' during their assault on [[Port Fuad]].\n\n== Other operators==\nAt the end of the war, the oldest LVT versions were disposed as surplus and sold to other countries. Only LVT-3 and LVT(A)-5s remained in operational use in US armed forces.\n\nA couple of LVT-3s were assigned in 1943 to Arctic Expedition, after being modified to operate in cold environment.\n\n== Modern descendants ==\nIn the 1950s, LVTs still in service were replaced by the [[LVTP-5]] family of vehicles, which in turn were followed by the [[LVT-7]] family, eventually redesignated [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|AAV]]. The AAV is manufactured by [[BAE Systems Land and Armaments]], which was the first company to produce the LVT (as FMC).\n\nIn 1958, the US Navy tested the largest LVT ever produced, the [[LVT(U)X2]] ''Goliath'' produced by [[Pacific Car and Foundry]]. The Goliath was large enough to transport any load the conventional [[Landing Craft Utility|LCU]] could carry, including a 60-ton main battle tank, from a [[Dock landing ship|landing dock ship]] to shore and across beach barriers. Only one Goliath was built and it never became operational.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vtsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA127 '' \"Goliath Goes Anywhere\" '', March 1959, Popular Mechanics]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=oWX-x0b4pw4C&pg=PA302 '' \"US Amphibious Ships and Aircraft\" '', by Norman Friedman, 2002]</ref>\n\nCurrently, many of the world's militaries employ more modern versions of the amtrack. One of the latest is the now cancelled [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], that was slated to begin replacing the AAV in 2015 but was cancelled in 2011 after going significantly over budget.\n\n== Variants ==\nThe US Army used a different naming system from the Navy. Instead of using the usual Army system of [[List of U.S. military vehicles by model number|Model or M-numbers]], they referred to the LVTs by Mark number using Roman numerals rather than Arabic numerals. Hence the LVT-4 was the \"Mark IV\" (which was not the same as the \"[[M4 Sherman|M4]]\").<ref name=Icks16/>\n[[File:An-American-amphibious-armored-vehicle-starts-down-the-lowered-ramp-391753836072.jpg|thumb|LVT-1]]\n===''LVT-1'' (1941)===\nThe first military model. Traveling at a respectable {{convert|6|knot}}  in the water and {{convert|12|mph}} on land, it could deliver 24 fully equipped assault troops to the beach and supply supporting fire from two .30 [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]s though it was only intended for delivering supplies inland until wheeled vehicles could be brought ashore. It was powered by a {{cvt|146|bhp}} six-cylinder petrol engine, mounted in a housing in the rear cargo hold. The LVT-1 was propelled on both land and water by tracks which were fitted with Roebling patented oblique shoes that gave good grip on land as well as good drive in the water. Apart of the forward driver's compartment, the bulk of the unarmoured steel hull was given over to a {{convert|4500|lb}} payload cargo hold which was divided into several watertight compartments. 1,225 LVT-1s were built between 1941 and 1943, 485 were transferred to US Army and 200 to British Army. LVT-1 had a maximum speed of {{cvt|12|mph}} on land or {{cvt|6.9|mph}} in water; and a range of {{convert|210|mi}} on land or {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} in water.\n\nNo armor or weapons were included in its design as its role was cargo transport from ship to shore. Many vehicles were refitted prior to the [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa landing]] to hold two {{convert|.50|in}} Browning heavy machine guns forward, with the .30 guns aft. The vehicle was not armored and its thin steel hull offered virtually no protection, although prior to Tarawa some vehicles received {{cvt|9|mm}} of armor plating to the cab. Tracks performed well on [[sand]], but not on tough surfaces. The rigid suspension threw tracks and roller bearings corroded in salt water.{{sfn|Icks|1970|p=9}} Proper maintenance of the new machine was often an issue, as few Marines were trained to work on it, and early models suffered frequent breakdowns. As LVT-1 vehicles experienced many breakdowns they were gradually phased out of operational use before 1945.\n\n=== ''LVT-2 Water Buffalo'', British designation ''Buffalo II'' (1942)===\n[[File:USMC LVT-2 Water Buffalo.JPEG|thumb|LVT-2 Water Buffalo with Marines bound for the beaches of Tinian Island, 1944]]\nThis was an improved version of LVT-1. It featured a new powertrain (To save time and to simplify production it was the same as that in the [[M3 Stuart|M3A1]] light tank) and torsilastic suspension. The aluminium track grousers were bolted on, making changes much easier since they wore out quickly on land and even more so on coral. Hard terrain performance was much better compared to the LVT-1. 2,962 units were produced for the US Navy, who then proceeded to transfer 1,507 to the US Army and 100 to the British Army. With a maximum speed of {{cvt|20|mph}} on Land (or {{cvt|7.5|mph}} on water) and an operational range of miles on land (or {{cvt|50|mi}} on water) the LVT-2 could carry a payload of {{cvt|6950|lb}}.\n\nLVT-2s participated in more campaigns that any other LVT variant, including Tarawa, Roi-Namur, Cape Gloucester, Northern Kwajalein, Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and in some parts of Europe, such as the Rhine crossing of [[Operation Plunder]].\n\n===''LVT(A)-1'' (1942)===\n[[File:LVT (A) in Military Museum Beijing 20181020.jpg|thumb|LVT(A)-1]]\nThe first infantry support LVT. With the first experience of Pacific amphibious operations it was clear heavier firepower than the usual .50 in guns was needed. Based on the LVT-2, ''A'' standing for armored, this fire support version had a hull plated with {{convert|6|to|12|mm|in|frac=4}} of armor. It was fitted with a turret nearly identical to that of the [[Stuart tank|Light Tank M3]], with a [[37mm Gun M3|37 mm Gun M6]] in an M44 mount, and also carried two rear-mounted machine guns, 509 units were produced. The vehicle's hull was covered in 6-12mm of armor plate, and the vehicle was powered by a {{cvt|262|bhp}} air-cooled petrol engine. Despite the limitations imposed by the turret, it could still carry a limited payload of {{cvt|1000|lb|sigfig=2}} of cargo and had a quite respectable speed of {{cvt|25|mph}} on land and {{cvt|6.5|mph}} in water, and an operational range of {{cvt|125|mi|km|-1}} on land or {{cvt|75|mi|km|-1}} in water.\n\nThese vehicles were intended to provide fire support to the assaulting Marines in the early stages of establishing a beachhead. It was common, however, for the LVT(A)s to commence firing whilst still in the water, which, considering the amount of naval gunfire that usually accompanied a landing, may have been a waste of ammunition.\n\nAt Roi-Namur, the 24th Marines had support of LVT(A)-1s, but they could not close up enough to effectively support the troops from the beaches. Other LVT(A)-1s supported the 22nd Marines landing at Engebi. By mid-1944, all LVT(A)-1s had been replaced by much more capable 75mm gun armed LVT(A)-4s.\n\n===''LVT(A)-2 Water Buffalo'' (1943)===\nThis was an armored version of the LVT-2 following the US Army request for an armored variant of the LVT-2 cargo Amtrac. Service in the South Pacific soon indicated more protection was needed. This version had the driver's cab protected by {{cvt|0.5|in}} of armor plate, and the rest of the hull with {{convert|1/4|in|mm}} armor plate. By 1944, shields were added to protect the front gunners. Surprisingly the additional {{convert|2750|lb}} of armor, added to the {{convert|24,250|lb|kg|adj=on}} weight of the unarmored LVT-2, had no impact on performance and only caused the craft to draw an additional {{convert|2|in}} of water when afloat. Capacity 18 troops. 450 units produced.\n\n===''LVT-4 Water Buffalo'', British designation ''Buffalo IV'' (1943)===\nFMC modified an LVT-2 in August 1943 by moving the engine forward and adding a large ramp door in the rear,<ref>{{cite book |title= Tanks and armored fighting vehicles of World War 2 |last=Winchester |first=Jim |year=2004 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=Edison, New Jersey |isbn= 0-7607-6464-6 |pages=172\u2013173 }}</ref> allowing troops to exit from the rear of the vehicle. Capacity went from 16 troops in the LVT-2 to 30, making earlier LVTs largely obsolete. This innovation also greatly facilitated the loading and unloading of cargo. Some vehicles received armor kits. It was by far the most numerous version of the LVT, with 8,348 units delivered; the US Army received 6,083, and the British Army 500. Many of the British LVT-4 were armed with a [[20 mm Polsten]] cannon and 2 \u00d7 .30 in (7.62&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]].\n\nSince no major changes were made to the engine and transmission of the LVT-2, the LVT-4 was completed much quicker than the LVT-3, with the first machines going into action at Saipan in June 1944.\n\n===''Sea Serpent''===\nThe Sea Serpent was designed by the [[79th Armoured Division]] for use by the British in the [[Far East]]. Its armament was two [[Petroleum Warfare Department#Wasp|\"Wasp\" flamethrowers]] and a machine gun. These would have been used by the \"flame battery\" of the 34th Amphibian Support Regiment, [[Royal Marines]] in any assault on the Japanese mainland but the war ended before they were used.<ref>Fletcher, ''The Universal Tank'' 1993 HMSO 0 11 290534 X pp 109-110</ref>\n\n===''LVT(A)-3''===\nArmored version of the LVT-4, never approved for production.\n\n===''LVT-3 Bushmaster'' (1944)===\n[[File:LVT3-amp11.JPG|thumb|LVT-3]]\nDeveloped by the [[BorgWarner|Borg Warner Corporation]] as their Model B in April 1943. To allow for rear loading, the engines were moved to the [[sponsons]] and a ramp installed in the rear, and slightly wider to provide room for a Jeep to be carried in the cargo hold. Some received armor kits. First used in combat in Okinawa in April 1945. 2,962 units produced, with many remaining in US service until 1955 when they were finally superseded by the LVTP-5. Powered by the same twin {{convert|148|bhp}} Cadillac V-8 petrol engines and transmission of the M5 light tank, it could carry a payload of 9,000&nbsp;lbs or 30 fully armed soldiers. It performed with efficiency and greater reliability, as more maintenance time was generally available than during the hectic days of the major World War II. The LVT(3)C remained standard with the Marine Corps until the introduction of the first major post\u2014war design, the LVT(P)5, in 1953. Overall weight of the craft was {{convert|26,600|lb|kg}}, and its maximum speed was {{convert|17|mph}} on land or {{convert|6|mph}} on water, with an operational range of {{convert|150|mi|km}} on land or {{convert|75|mi|km}} on water.\n\n===''LVT(A)-4'' (1944)===\nThe 37&nbsp;mm gun of the LVT(A)-1 was inadequate for fire support version so the turret of the [[Howitzer Motor Carriage M8|75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8]]{{snd}}armed with a 75&nbsp;mm howitzer{{snd}}was used to produce the LVT (A)-4. In some cases, the 75&nbsp;mm was replaced with the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Ronson flamethrower]]. A single .50 cal machine gun was installed on the ring mount above the turret rear. In the late production vehicles, the heavy machine gun was replaced with two M1919A4 .30&nbsp;MGs on pintle mounts and one more in the bow mount. 1,890 units produced, and 1,307 were transferred to US Army and 50 to British Army.\n\nThe Chinese PLA captured several from Nationalist forces during the Civil War and placed them in service, eventually modifying some by replacing the 75&nbsp;mm howitzer with the 37&nbsp;mm M6 tank gun and others with the [[ZiS-2]] 57&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun, complete with shield, the conversion also necessitating the removal of the original mantlet.\n\n===''LVT(A)-5'' (1945)===\nLVT(A)-4 with a powered turret and a [[gyrostabilizer]] for the howitzer. Some were upgraded in the late 1940s by changing the armor configuration. 269 units produced.\n\n[[File:LVT3C-amp24.JPG|thumb|LVT-3C]]\n===''LVT-3C'' (1949)===\nModified LVT-3. An armored roof was fitted and the bow was extended to improve buoyancy. Armament included a .30&nbsp;MG in a turret and a .30 bow MG in ball mount. 1,200 LVT-3s were converted.\n\n===''Amphibian, tracked, 4-ton General Service'' (1944/45)===\nA British vehicle based on the LVT-4 and known as the ''Neptune''.

The [[United States Marine Corps]], [[United States Army]], and [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] and [[British Army|British armies]] used several LVT models during [[World War II]].\n\nOriginally intended solely as cargo carriers for ship to shore operations, they evolved into assault troop and fire support vehicles. The types were known as '''amphtrack''', \"amtrak\", \"amtrac\", etc. ([[portmanteau]]s of \"amphibious tractor\"), and \"alligator\" or \"gator\".\n\n== Development ==\n=== The Alligator===\nThe LVT had its origins in a civilian rescue vehicle called the ''Alligator''. Developed by [[Donald Roebling]] in 1935, the Alligator was intended to operate in swampy areas, inaccessible to both traditional cars and boats. Two years later, Roebling built a redesigned vehicle with improved water speed. The [[United States Marine Corps]], which had been developing [[amphibious warfare]] doctrine based on the ideas of [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lt. Col]] [[Earl Hancock Ellis|Earl Hancock \"Pete\" Ellis]] and others, became interested in the machine after learning about it through an article in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] and convinced Roebling to design a more seaworthy model for military use.<ref name=nip>{{cite journal |last=Seese |first=Robert J. |year=1983 |title=The Roebling Alligator |journal=[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]] |volume=109 |issue=12 |page=27 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] }}</ref>\n\nBoth the US Navy and Roebling resisted the idea of a military design, the US Navy because it felt conventional landing craft could do the job, and Roebling because he wished his invention to be used only for peaceful purposes. Roebling was persuaded after war broke out in Europe, and completed a militarized prototype by May 1940. The Bureau of Ships requested a second prototype with a more powerful engine, and the USMC tested the design in November 1940. Impressed by the second prototype, the Bureau of Ships placed a contract for production of 100 units of a model using all-steel construction, for a more rugged and easily produced design, and the first LVT-1 was delivered in July 1941. Another 200 units were ordered even before the first production units were delivered. After more improvements to meet requirements of the Navy, made difficult by Roebling's lack of blueprints for the initial designs, the vehicle was adopted as \"Landing Vehicle Tracked\" or LVT.<ref name=nip/>\n\n===The LVT-1 design===\nThe contract to build the first 200 LVTs was awarded to the [[Food Machinery Corporation]] (FMC), a manufacturer of [[insecticide]] spray pumps and other farm equipment, which built some parts for the Alligators. The initial 200 LVTs were built at FMC's [[Dunedin, Florida]] factory, where most of the improvement work had been done as well. The first production LVT rolled out of the plant in July, 1941.<ref name=nip/> Later, wartime LVT production was expanded by FMC and the Navy to four factories, including the initial facility in Dunedin; the new facilities were located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], [[Riverside, California]], and [[San Jose, California]].\n\nThe LVT-1 could carry 18 fully equipped men or {{convert|4,500|lb}} of cargo.<ref>''The complete guide to tanks and armoured fighting vehicles'', p. 314, {{ISBN|978-1-84681-110-4}}, {{ISBN|1-84681-110-4}}</ref> Originally intended to carry replenishment from ships to shore, they lacked [[vehicle armour|armor protection]] and their tracks and suspension were unreliable when used on hard terrain. However, the Marines soon recognized the potential of the LVT as an assault vehicle. A battalion of LVTs was ready for 1st Marine Division by 16 February 1942. The LVTs saw their first operational use in Guadalcanal, where they were used exclusively for landing supplies. About 128 LVTs were available for the landings.\n\n=== LVT-2 Buffalo and other developments===\nAs early as January 1940, Roebling had prepared preliminary sketches of an LVT with a gun turret to provide fire support to the landing waves. The concept languished until June 1941, when USMC recommended development of an LVT armed with a 37mm gun and three machine guns and armored against 0.50 (12.7mm) machine gun fire. Development was slow and ultimately involved a complete redesign of the LVT, the LVT-2 Buffalo. Armored versions were introduced as well as fire support versions, dubbed ''Amtanks'', which were fitted with turrets from [[Stuart tank|Stuart series light tanks]] (LVT(A)-1) and [[Howitzer Motor Carriage M8]]s (LVT(A)-4).\n\nAmong other upgrades were a new powerpack (engine and cooling accessories), also borrowed from the Stuarts, and a rubber \"torsilastic\" [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] which improved performance on land. After Borg-Warner evaluated the LVT-1, Borg-Warner and FMC began work on new designs. FMC was assisted by faculty from Caltech and the University of California and developed the designs that became the LVT-2 and the LVT(A)-1. Interest in the LVT was enough that the Secretary of the Navy formed the Continued Board for the Development of the Landing Vehicle Tracked on 30 October 1943.\n\nProduction continued throughout the war, resulting in 18,616 LVTs delivered. 23 US Army and 11 USMC battalions were equipped by 1945 with LVTs. British and Australian armies also used LVTs in combat during World War II.\n\nIn the late 1940s, a series of prototypes were built and tested, but none reached production stage due to lack of funding. Realizing that acquisition of new vehicles was unlikely, the Marines modernized some of the LVT-3s and LVT(A)-5s and kept them in service until the late 1950s.\n\n==Combat history==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\n\n=== Guadalcanal===\nUSMC LVT-1s were mainly used for logistical support at [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]]. LVT-1 proved in this campaign its tactical capabilities, versatility and potential for amphibious operations.\n[[File:LVT amphibian tractors move toward the beach on Guadalcanal in August 1942.jpg|thumb|LVT-1 move toward the beach on Guadalcanal. The [[USS President Hayes (APA-20)|USS ''President Hayes'' (AP-39)]] is seen in the background.]]\nAs LVT-1s were unarmed, the Marines decided to arm them using any available machine gun. Each one was armed with three .30-caliber machine guns (sometimes water-cooled models) and a .50-caliber machine gun. Organization of LVTs of the Amphibian Tractor Battalions for the assault:\n* Company \"A\" of 1st Battalion with thirty LVT-1 was assigned to the [[5th Marine Regiment|5th Marines]] which was to land on Guadalcanal.\n* A platoon of LVT-1s would go ashore on [[Tulagi]] assigned to 2nd Marine Battalion.{{citation needed||date=August 2019}}\n* Company \"B\" was assigned to the [[1st Marine Regiment]].\n* The remainder of the 1st Battalion remained with the [[1st Marine Division|1st Division]]'s support group.\n* Company \"A\" of the 2nd Battalion was assigned to [[2nd Marine Regiment]], the landing force reserve.\n\n===Tarawa===\nIn the [[Battle of Tarawa|amphibious assault on Tarawa]] in late 1943, the LVTs were first used for amphibious assault in order to negotiate the barrier reef and arrive to the most heavily defended beaches the Americans ever met in the Pacific. This was also the first use of the LVT-2 Water Buffalo in combat. [[2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion|2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion]] LVTs took part in the first, second, and third waves of landings and carried the continuous supply of ammunition, reinforcements, and ferrying back of the wounded. Of 125 vehicles used (50 new LVT-2s and 75 LVT-1s), only 35 remained operational by the end of the first day, continuing to ferry men and supplies across the coral reef and through the shallows to the beach.\n\n[[File:Tank at Tarawa.jpg|thumb|Disabled LVTs and a [[Type 95 Ha-Go|Type 95 light tank]] on Tarawa.]]\n\nThe 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion had only about 79 LVT-1s and 50 LVT-2s (directly shipped from San Diego) available for the assault. Most of the troops had to disembark from [[LCVP (United States)|LCVP]] \"Higgins boats\" and wade across the reef chest-deep or higher water while under heavy enemy fire. American casualties were very heavy and many who made to the beach alive had lost their [[rifle]]s and other essential gear.\n\n=== Developments in the Pacific===\nAfter Tarawa, many changes were made. The USMC recommended that a battalion of armored LVTs, two companies of [[DUKW]]s and two battalions of cargo LVTs be assigned to each division in future amphibious operations. The number of LVTs by battalion was increased to 300; before Tarawa it was 100. Due to mechanical reliability problems after every landing, the Marines replaced all LVTs used in operations.\n\nAs a result of Tarawa experience, standardized armor kits were provided for the LVTs to be used in contested landings. Other improvements were made in the damage repair area, machine gun shields, and in the LVT design to increase crew and LVT survivability.\n\nThe gun-armed \"amtank\" LVT(A)-1 and LVT(A)-4 were developed to provide fire support. Armed with a 75mm howitzer, the latter was introduced in 1944 just before the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas campaign]] and was especially effective in this role as it was capable of destroying Japanese fortifications as it came ashore. Its howitzer complemented the 75mm gun of the [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] used by the Marines. However, the LVT(A)-4 had an open-topped turret which left the crew vulnerable to artillery and infantry attack, especially to the latter, as it lacked any sort of machine gun armament. The lack of machine gun armament was eventually rectified, though the open-topped turret remained in order to save weight. Although usually used in a direct role during landings only (once inland the \"amtanks\" were assigned to artillery formations to augment their firepower), in the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas campaign]] \"amtanks\" were employed inland, much like regular tanks.\n\n=== Bougainville ===\nIn November 1943, US Marines [[Bougainville Campaign|landed on the island of Bougainville]]. 29 LVTs were landed on the first day, with a total of 124 LVTs operating with the Marines during the landing.\n\n=== Marshall Islands===\nIn the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|campaign for the Marshall Islands,]] the full range of the LVT models became available, including armed Amtrac LVTs based on the proven LVT-2 with a tank gun turret. This provided close-in firepower as the cargo LVTs neared the beach. The combination of armoured cargo LVT-2 and the armed LVT(A)-1 together helped to capture the Marshalls far ahead of schedule.\n\n=== Saipan===\n[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] saw the massive use of the LVTs by the USMC with six battalions of cargo LVT, including the new ramped LVT-4, and two battalions of armored Amtracs, employing the new LVT(A)-4 with a 75&nbsp;mm howitzer.\n\n===Tinian===\n[[File:LVT-2 doodlebug.jpg|thumb|LVT-2 doodlebug in testing on Saipan]]\nAt [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]] a field variant of the LVT-2 was created by the [[Seabees]] of the 3rd Battalion [[18th Marines]] and 3rd Battalion [[20th Marines]].<ref name=\"Tinian\">Seabees and doodlebugs at Tinian, This date in Seabee History July 24 1944, Seabee Museum website, Port Hueneme, CA[V]</ref> V Amphibious Corps chose beaches abutted by [[coral]] embankments up to 15 feet. \nThe Japanese thought the embankments the beaches unsuitable for a landing. The [[Civil Engineer Corps|CB engineers]] constructed detachable ramps mounted on LVTs to make such an assault possible.<ref name=\"Tinian\"/> Salvaging iron beams from the damaged sugar factory on Saipan they fabricated 10 assault vehicles.<ref name=\"Tinian\"/> The commanding Marine General was skeptical and ordered a vehicle go up and down a ramp 100 times before approving their use in combat. The Tinian assault was a success.  The defenders were quickly overwhelmed compromising the remainder of the defences.<ref name=\"Tinian\"/>  The Seabees named their LVTs \"doddlebugs\".<ref name=\"Tinian\"/>\n\n===Peleliu===\nFrom the [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu campaign]] on, a number of LVTs were fitted with a [[flamethrower]] for use against fortifications. The LVT was usually flanked by a pair of gun tanks for protection. A number of LVTs were converted to armored ambulances carrying a [[Physician|doctor]] and three [[Hospital corpsman|corpsmen]]. LVTs were also employed as guide boats for tanks unloading onto submerged reefs.\n\n===Leyte===\nThe largest use of LVTs{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} was in the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte landing]] in October 1944, with nine US Army amtrac and two amtank [[battalion]]s deployed by [[Sixth United States Army|US Army 6th Army]]. These US Army LVTs were later used in other [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Philippine islands]] landings.<ref>[http://www.natread.com/node/3 The 788th Amphibian Tractor Battalion]</ref> 54 LVT(4) tracked amphibious assault vehicles of the 672nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion as part of the raiding force on 23 February 1945 forged across Laguna de Bay and crashed the gates during the [[Raid on Los Ba\u00f1os|liberation of Los Ba\u00f1os Internment Camp]]. They ferried the weakened liberated civilians back behind the lines during the contested withdrawal.\n\n===Iwo Jima===\nThe LVT-4 played a crucial role both as the assault vehicle to carry troops and as the chief logistical vehicle in the first days of [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]. Ashore, the LVTs were used to rescue wheeled vehicles that could not navigate [[Iwo Jima]]'s soft volcanic ash and steep terraces. In addition, American troops used the LVTs to transport casualties from the front lines to evacuation sites on the beaches. The 75&nbsp;mm howitzer on the LVT-4 provided important fire support as the Marines slowly advanced across the island.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/IV/index.html | title=HyperWar: USMC Operations in WWII: Vol IV--Western Pacific Operations}}</ref>\n\n===Okinawa===\nThis was the largest landing in the Central Pacific drive. The new LVT-3, a redesign of internal arrangements, was used successfully through the long [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]]. Over 1000 LVTs took part in the [[Battle of Okinawa]].\n\n===Europe===\nIn Europe, LVTs were mainly used for landings and river crossing operations as well as assaults in swampy zones. By the end of 1943, 200 LVT-1s had been delivered to the British Army for training in preparation for future operations in Europe. The U.S., [[British Army|British]], and [[Canadian Army|Canadian armies]] used the Buffalo in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]] (1944), during the [[Operation Plunder|Operation ''Plunder'']] crossing of the [[Rhine]], along the [[Po River]] in Italy, across the river Elbe, and in a number of other river crossing operations.\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B11628.jpg|thumb|Buffalo amphibians during the invasion of Walcheren Island, November 1944.]]\nLVTs were used in the [[Normandy landings]], but their use by the United States was limited as the US Army doctrine in Europe viewed the [[DD tank|Sherman DD]] as the answer to assault on heavily defended beaches. LVT-2s were used to help unload supplies after the landings on [[Utah Beach]] from the cargo ships off the coast to the beach and through the nearby swamps.\n\nFor the Rhine crossing, the British [[21st Army Group]] had some 600 Buffalos available, most of them used to transport the assault infantry. As mud was expected to hamper the Sherman DD tanks, some LVTs were armed with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon and two machine guns to give fire support until bridges could be constructed across the river. The \"Specials\" were assigned to the [[79th Armoured Division]] (which operated all specialist assault vehicles), that also provided Buffalos fitted with [[Churchill_tank#Churchill_AVRE_(Assault_Vehicle_Royal_Engineers)|\"Bobbin\" carpets]] to create temporary roadways over the mud.\n\nThe US Army used LVT-2s and LVT-4s in Europe in small numbers in 1944-45 for river crossing operations. LVT-2s and LVT-4s were used by US troops on the [[Operation Grenade|Roer River crossing]] in 1945. US Army LVT-4's were also used by [[752nd Tank Battalion]] to ferry [[88th Infantry Division (United States)|88th Infantry Division]] troops across the [[Po (river)|Po River]] in [[Italy]] in April 1945.\n\nFive LVT-4s were supplied through [[Lend-Lease]] to the [[Red Army|Soviet Red Army]], which used them when assaulting the well-defended west banks of the [[Oder]] and [[Danube]] rivers.\n\n===North Africa===\nThe first operational use of the LVT in North Africa was in November 1942. A small number of LVT-1s were used during the landings on the coast of North Africa during [[Operation Torch]]. Four LVT-1s and two bulldozers were assigned to each shore party engineer company. Their tasks were towing vehicles and boat salvage operations. LVT-1s proved useful in getting stranded landing craft afloat, but they also experienced many mechanical failures.\n\n===South East Asia===\nSome of the reconnaissance units of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fourteenth Army]] in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] operated LVT-1s. Although originally planned to fight against the Japanese on the Burmese coast at the end of 1943, this part of the operations plan was cancelled and no LVT-1s were used in combat.\n\nIn 1945, the [[Royal Marines]] Amphibious support unit was created. Its LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s supported Royal Marines landings in Burma and Malaya.\n\n===Post WWII===\nSome LVT-3s, LVT-3Cs, and modified LVT(A)-5s saw action in the [[Korean War]]. The [[French Army]] used the U.S.-supplied LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s in the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]] and in the [[Suez Crisis]].\n[[File:LSD-22-Fort-Marion-LVT-korea.jpg|thumb|LVTs embarking Royal Marine commandos leave Fort Marion (LSD-22) for the beach at Sorye Dong, North Korea, on 7 April 1951.]]\nDuring the Korean War, LVT(3)Cs and LVT(A)s were used for the [[Battle of Inchon|landing in Incheon]] and subsequent [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]  crossing to re-take Seoul. It was also used in the [[Hungnam evacuation|evacuation of Hungnam]] Harbour when Chinese forces attacked. The LVT(3)C was used by USMC in Korea as both an amphibious vehicle, and in the role of an armored personnel carrier while on land.\n\nNationalist China (ROC) forces used some US-provided LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s during [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] against [[People's Liberation Army|communist Chinese troops]]. Many were captured by communist Chinese forces, with at least several dozen refitted with a Soviet ZiS-2 57&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun in place of the original US 75&nbsp;mm howitzer-gun following their successful capture of mainland China from the Chinese Nationalists in 1949.\n\nFrench armored units developed the use of amphibious tracked vehicles in Indochina: The amphibious C model of the [[M29 Weasel]] (armed either with [[FM 24/29 light machine gun|Chaterrault M1924/29]], [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] or [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning M1919]] machine guns and with [[M18 recoilless rifle|57mm M18A1]] recoilless guns),{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=24}} LVT-4s (equipped with two M2 and two M1919 machine guns, and sometimes equipped with [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40mm Bofors guns]]{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=25}} or 57&nbsp;mm recoilless guns){{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=24}} and LVT(A)-4 (with 75&nbsp;mm howitzer) were used to great effect by ''[[1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment|1er R\u00e9giment Etrangers de Cavalerie]]''.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=33}} In 1950, the French Army received a number of LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s from the US to supplement M29Cs.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=17}} In September 1951, the first French mixed unit (''1er Groupement Autonome'') was created, consisting of two squadrons of Weasels (33 each), three squadrons of LVT-4 (11 each) and one fire support platoon of 6 LVT(A)-4. Later a second group was created in [[Tonkin]] when more LVTs were received. Both these groups participated in [[Mekong Delta|Mekong]] and [[Red River delta]] operations and in landing operations on Vietnam shores.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=18}} The {{ill|1er r\u00e9giment de chasseurs \u00e0 cheval|fr|1er r\u00e9giment de chasseurs \u00e0 cheval (France)}} also deployed a platoon of LVTs.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=29}} LVTs were known as \"alligators\" in French armed forces.{{sfn|Dunstan|2019|p=17}}\n\nDuring the [[Suez crisis|1956 Suez Canal crisis]], [[40 Commando|40]] and [[42 Commando]] of the [[Royal Marines]] made a landing in [[Port Said]] using their available LVTs, supported by a number of [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion tanks]] from the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The [[French Navy]] assigned 13 LVT-4s to the Force H, to be used by the ''1\u00e8re compagnie du [[1st Foreign Parachute Regiment|1er R.E.P.]]'' and ''3eme Marine Commando'' during their assault on [[Port Fuad]].\n\n== Other operators==\nAt the end of the war, the oldest LVT versions were disposed as surplus and sold to other countries. Only LVT-3 and LVT(A)-5s remained in operational use in US armed forces.\n\nA couple of LVT-3s were assigned in 1943 to Arctic Expedition, after being modified to operate in cold environment.\n\n== Modern descendants ==\nIn the 1950s, LVTs still in service were replaced by the [[LVTP-5]] family of vehicles, which in turn were followed by the [[LVT-7]] family, eventually redesignated [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|AAV]]. The AAV is manufactured by [[BAE Systems Land and Armaments]], which was the first company to produce the LVT (as FMC).\n\nIn 1958, the US Navy tested the largest LVT ever produced, the [[LVT(U)X2]] ''Goliath'' produced by [[Pacific Car and Foundry]]. The Goliath was large enough to transport any load the conventional [[Landing Craft Utility|LCU]] could carry, including a 60-ton main battle tank, from a [[Dock landing ship|landing dock ship]] to shore and across beach barriers. Only one Goliath was built and it never became operational.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vtsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA127 '' \"Goliath Goes Anywhere\" '', March 1959, Popular Mechanics]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=oWX-x0b4pw4C&pg=PA302 '' \"US Amphibious Ships and Aircraft\" '', by Norman Friedman, 2002]</ref>\n\nCurrently, many of the world's militaries employ more modern versions of the amtrack. One of the latest is the now cancelled [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], that was slated to begin replacing the AAV in 2015 but was cancelled in 2011 after going significantly over budget.\n\n== Variants ==\nThe US Army used a different naming system from the Navy. Instead of using the usual Army system of [[List of U.S. military vehicles by model number|Model or M-numbers]], they referred to the LVTs by Mark number using Roman numerals rather than Arabic numerals. Hence the LVT-4 was the \"Mark IV\" (which was not the same as the \"[[M4 Sherman|M4]]\").<ref name=Icks16/>\n[[File:An-American-amphibious-armored-vehicle-starts-down-the-lowered-ramp-391753836072.jpg|thumb|LVT-1]]\n===''LVT-1'' (1941)===\nThe first military model. Traveling at a respectable {{convert|6|knot}}  in the water and {{convert|12|mph}} on land, it could deliver 24 fully equipped assault troops to the beach and supply supporting fire from two .30 [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]s though it was only intended for delivering supplies inland until wheeled vehicles could be brought ashore. It was powered by a {{cvt|146|bhp}} six-cylinder petrol engine, mounted in a housing in the rear cargo hold. The LVT-1 was propelled on both land and water by tracks which were fitted with Roebling patented oblique shoes that gave good grip on land as well as good drive in the water. Apart of the forward driver's compartment, the bulk of the unarmoured steel hull was given over to a {{convert|4500|lb}} payload cargo hold which was divided into several watertight compartments. 1,225 LVT-1s were built between 1941 and 1943, 485 were transferred to US Army and 200 to British Army. LVT-1 had a maximum speed of {{cvt|12|mph}} on land or {{cvt|6.9|mph}} in water; and a range of {{convert|210|mi}} on land or {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} in water.\n\nNo armor or weapons were included in its design as its role was cargo transport from ship to shore. Many vehicles were refitted prior to the [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa landing]] to hold two {{convert|.50|in}} Browning heavy machine guns forward, with the .30 guns aft. The vehicle was not armored and its thin steel hull offered virtually no protection, although prior to Tarawa some vehicles received {{cvt|9|mm}} of armor plating to the cab. Tracks performed well on [[sand]], but not on tough surfaces. The rigid suspension threw tracks and roller bearings corroded in salt water.{{sfn|Icks|1970|p=9}} Proper maintenance of the new machine was often an issue, as few Marines were trained to work on it, and early models suffered frequent breakdowns. As LVT-1 vehicles experienced many breakdowns they were gradually phased out of operational use before 1945.\n\n=== ''LVT-2 Water Buffalo'', British designation ''Buffalo II'' (1942)===\n[[File:USMC LVT-2 Water Buffalo.JPEG|thumb|LVT-2 Water Buffalo with Marines bound for the beaches of Tinian Island, 1944]]\nThis was an improved version of LVT-1. It featured a new powertrain (To save time and to simplify production it was the same as that in the [[M3 Stuart|M3A1]] light tank) and torsilastic suspension. The aluminium track grousers were bolted on, making changes much easier since they wore out quickly on land and even more so on coral. Hard terrain performance was much better compared to the LVT-1. 2,962 units were produced for the US Navy, who then proceeded to transfer 1,507 to the US Army and 100 to the British Army. With a maximum speed of {{cvt|20|mph}} on Land (or {{cvt|7.5|mph}} on water) and an operational range of miles on land (or {{cvt|50|mi}} on water) the LVT-2 could carry a payload of {{cvt|6950|lb}}.\n\nLVT-2s participated in more campaigns that any other LVT variant, including Tarawa, Roi-Namur, Cape Gloucester, Northern Kwajalein, Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and in some parts of Europe, such as the Rhine crossing of [[Operation Plunder]].\n\n===''LVT(A)-1'' (1942)===\n[[File:LVT (A) in Military Museum Beijing 20181020.jpg|thumb|LVT(A)-1]]\nThe first infantry support LVT. With the first experience of Pacific amphibious operations it was clear heavier firepower than the usual .50 in guns was needed. Based on the LVT-2, ''A'' standing for armored, this fire support version had a hull plated with {{convert|6|to|12|mm|in|frac=4}} of armor. It was fitted with a turret nearly identical to that of the [[Stuart tank|Light Tank M3]], with a [[37mm Gun M3|37 mm Gun M6]] in an M44 mount, and also carried two rear-mounted machine guns, 509 units were produced. The vehicle's hull was covered in 6-12mm of armor plate, and the vehicle was powered by a {{cvt|262|bhp}} air-cooled petrol engine. Despite the limitations imposed by the turret, it could still carry a limited payload of {{cvt|1000|lb|sigfig=2}} of cargo and had a quite respectable speed of {{cvt|25|mph}} on land and {{cvt|6.5|mph}} in water, and an operational range of {{cvt|125|mi|km|-1}} on land or {{cvt|75|mi|km|-1}} in water.\n\nThese vehicles were intended to provide fire support to the assaulting Marines in the early stages of establishing a beachhead. It was common, however, for the LVT(A)s to commence firing whilst still in the water, which, considering the amount of naval gunfire that usually accompanied a landing, may have been a waste of ammunition.\n\nAt Roi-Namur, the 24th Marines had support of LVT(A)-1s, but they could not close up enough to effectively support the troops from the beaches. Other LVT(A)-1s supported the 22nd Marines landing at Engebi. By mid-1944, all LVT(A)-1s had been replaced by much more capable 75mm gun armed LVT(A)-4s.\n\n===''LVT(A)-2 Water Buffalo'' (1943)===\nThis was an armored version of the LVT-2 following the US Army request for an armored variant of the LVT-2 cargo Amtrac. Service in the South Pacific soon indicated more protection was needed. This version had the driver's cab protected by {{cvt|0.5|in}} of armor plate, and the rest of the hull with {{convert|1/4|in|mm}} armor plate. By 1944, shields were added to protect the front gunners. Surprisingly the additional {{convert|2750|lb}} of armor, added to the {{convert|24,250|lb|kg|adj=on}} weight of the unarmored LVT-2, had no impact on performance and only caused the craft to draw an additional {{convert|2|in}} of water when afloat. Capacity 18 troops. 450 units produced.\n\n===''LVT-4 Water Buffalo'', British designation ''Buffalo IV'' (1943)===\nFMC modified an LVT-2 in August 1943 by moving the engine forward and adding a large ramp door in the rear,<ref>{{cite book |title= Tanks and armored fighting vehicles of World War 2 |last=Winchester |first=Jim |year=2004 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=Edison, New Jersey |isbn= 0-7607-6464-6 |pages=172\u2013173 }}</ref> allowing troops to exit from the rear of the vehicle. Capacity went from 16 troops in the LVT-2 to 30, making earlier LVTs largely obsolete. This innovation also greatly facilitated the loading and unloading of cargo. Some vehicles received armor kits. It was by far the most numerous version of the LVT, with 8,348 units delivered; the US Army received 6,083, and the British Army 500. Many of the British LVT-4 were armed with a [[20 mm Polsten]] cannon and 2 \u00d7 .30 in (7.62&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]].\n\nSince no major changes were made to the engine and transmission of the LVT-2, the LVT-4 was completed much quicker than the LVT-3, with the first machines going into action at Saipan in June 1944.\n\n===''Sea Serpent''===\nThe Sea Serpent was designed by the [[79th Armoured Division]] for use by the British in the [[Far East]]. Its armament was two [[Petroleum Warfare Department#Wasp|\"Wasp\" flamethrowers]] and a machine gun. These would have been used by the \"flame battery\" of the 34th Amphibian Support Regiment, [[Royal Marines]] in any assault on the Japanese mainland but the war ended before they were used.<ref>Fletcher, ''The Universal Tank'' 1993 HMSO 0 11 290534 X pp 109-110</ref>\n\n===''LVT(A)-3''===\nArmored version of the LVT-4, never approved for production.\n\n===''LVT-3 Bushmaster'' (1944)===\n[[File:LVT3-amp11.JPG|thumb|LVT-3]]\nDeveloped by the [[BorgWarner|Borg Warner Corporation]] as their Model B in April 1943. To allow for rear loading, the engines were moved to the [[sponsons]] and a ramp installed in the rear, and slightly wider to provide room for a Jeep to be carried in the cargo hold. Some received armor kits. First used in combat in Okinawa in April 1945. 2,962 units produced, with many remaining in US service until 1955 when they were finally superseded by the LVTP-5. Powered by the same twin {{convert|148|bhp}} Cadillac V-8 petrol engines and transmission of the M5 light tank, it could carry a payload of 9,000&nbsp;lbs or 30 fully armed soldiers. It performed with efficiency and greater reliability, as more maintenance time was generally available than during the hectic days of the major World War II. The LVT(3)C remained standard with the Marine Corps until the introduction of the first major post\u2014war design, the LVT(P)5, in 1953. Overall weight of the craft was {{convert|26,600|lb|kg}}, and its maximum speed was {{convert|17|mph}} on land or {{convert|6|mph}} on water, with an operational range of {{convert|150|mi|km}} on land or {{convert|75|mi|km}} on water.\n\n===''LVT(A)-4'' (1944)===\nThe 37&nbsp;mm gun of the LVT(A)-1 was inadequate for fire support version so the turret of the [[Howitzer Motor Carriage M8|75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8]]{{snd}}armed with a 75&nbsp;mm howitzer{{snd}}was used to produce the LVT (A)-4. In some cases, the 75&nbsp;mm was replaced with the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Ronson flamethrower]]. A single .50 cal machine gun was installed on the ring mount above the turret rear. In the late production vehicles, the heavy machine gun was replaced with two M1919A4 .30&nbsp;MGs on pintle mounts and one more in the bow mount. 1,890 units produced, and 1,307 were transferred to US Army and 50 to British Army.\n\nThe Chinese PLA captured several from Nationalist forces during the Civil War and placed them in service, eventually modifying some by replacing the 75&nbsp;mm howitzer with the 37&nbsp;mm M6 tank gun and others with the [[ZiS-2]] 57&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun, complete with shield, the conversion also necessitating the removal of the original mantlet.\n\n===''LVT(A)-5'' (1945)===\nLVT(A)-4 with a powered turret and a [[gyrostabilizer]] for the howitzer. Some were upgraded in the late 1940s by changing the armor configuration. 269 units produced.\n\n[[File:LVT3C-amp24.JPG|thumb|LVT-3C]]\n===''LVT-3C'' (1949)===\nModified LVT-3. An armored roof was fitted and the bow was extended to improve buoyancy. Armament included a .30&nbsp;MG in a turret and a .30 bow MG in ball mount. 1,200 LVT-3s were converted.\n\n===''Amphibian, tracked, 4-ton General Service'' (1944/45)===\nA British vehicle based on the LVT-4 and known as the ''Neptune''. Only a handful of the 2,000 ordered were completed.
