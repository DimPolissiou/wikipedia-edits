He served in the 1862\u201363 campaigns of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] as a regimental and later brigade commander. His career was fatally damaged by a disastrous infantry assault at the first day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. General [[Robert E. Lee]] removed Iverson from his army and sent him to cavalry duty in Georgia. During the [[Atlanta Campaign]], he achieved a notable success in a cavalry action near [[Macon, Georgia]], capturing [[Union Army]] [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George Stoneman]] and hundreds of his men.\n\n==Early years==\nIverson was born in Clinton, [[Jones County, Georgia]]. He was the son of [[Alfred Iverson Sr.]], [[United States Senator]] for Georgia and a fierce proponent of [[secession]], and Caroline Goode Holt. The senator decided on a military career for his son and enrolled him in the Tuskegee Military Institute.<ref name=Tagg295>Tagg, p. 295.</ref>\n\nIverson's career as a soldier began at the age of 17, when the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] began. His father raised and equipped a regiment of Georgia volunteers and young Iverson left Tuskegee to become a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the regiment. He left the service, in July 1848, to become a lawyer and contractor. In 1855, his [[Mexican\u2013American War]] experience gained him a commission as a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in the [[U.S. 1st Cavalry Regiment|1st U.S. Cavalry]] regiment. In that role he served in efforts to suppress the violence known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].<ref name=Tagg295/>\n\n==Civil War==\n\n===Early assignments===\nAt the start of the Civil War, Iverson resigned from the U.S. Army and received a commission from his father's old friend, [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], as colonel of the [[20th North Carolina Infantry]], a unit he played a strong role in recruiting. His regiment was initially stationed in North Carolina, but was called to the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in June 1862, for the [[Seven Days Battles]]. He distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Gaines's Mill]], in the division commanded by [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[D.H. Hill]], by leading the only successful regiment of the five that were assigned to capture a Union artillery battery. Iverson was severely wounded in the charge and his regiment took heavy casualties. Unfortunately for Iverson and the Confederacy, this battle would turn out to be the high point of his military career.<ref name=Tagg295/>\n\nIverson recovered in time to rejoin the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the [[Maryland Campaign]]. In the [[Battle of South Mountain]], his entire brigade was forced to retreat after their brigade commander, [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Samuel Garland]], was mortally wounded. Iverson's regiment ran away at the [[Battle of Antietam]] a few days later, although he was able to rally them to return to the battle. After the battle, Iverson was promoted to brigadier general on November 1, 1862, and given command of the brigade; causing the more senior Colonel [[Duncan K. McRae]], who had been in temporary command, to resign from the Army. His first assignment commanding his new brigade was at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], but he was assigned to the reserve and saw no action. Conflict soon resulted, however. When he attempted to name a new colonel for the 20th North Carolina, a personal friend from outside of the regiment, 26 of his officers signed a letter of protest against the action. Iverson attempted to arrest all 26 officers, but eventually cooled off. His friend was not placed as the new colonel, but Iverson petulantly refused all winter to promote any of the other candidates for the position.<ref name=Tagg296>Tagg, p. 296.</ref>\n\nAt [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], Iverson's brigade participated in [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]]'s famous flanking march, suffering heavy casualties (including Iverson himself, wounded in the groin by a spent shell), but managed to get less credit and notice than two other brigades in the line. Returning to the rear to get support for his flank, many of his officers concluded that he was shirking. His reasonable performance at Gaines's Mill the previous year forgotten, rumors swirled that he had achieved his command only by family political influence.<ref name=Tagg296/>\n\n===Gettysburg===\nThe nadir of Iverson's career was at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], where on July 1, 1863, his brigade of North Carolinians unknowingly marched into an ambush to the northwest of town. The division of Maj. Gen. [[Robert E. Rodes]] began its attack from Oak Hill with the brigades of Col. [[Edward A. O'Neal]] and Iverson. The attack fell apart for multiple reasons. Rodes acted somewhat hastily, seeing limited Union forces at his front, but not that reinforcements were arriving from the town.<ref>Pfanz, p. 165.</ref> [[Douglas Southall Freeman]] faulted Rodes for selecting two brigade commanders \"who had not distinguished themselves in the battles of May\" [i.e., Chancellorsville].<ref>Freeman, vol. 3, p. 83.</ref> Because of a misunderstanding, O'Neal used only three of his four regiments and he attacked on a narrow front at a place different from where Rodes had carefully indicated. Although the two brigades were meant to attack in support of each other, there is confusion about who was supposed to move first.<ref>Martin, pp. 220, 224; Sears, p. 196.</ref> O'Neal's ineffective attack was repulsed, leaving Iverson's flank exposed. But the most significant problem was that the two brigade commanders chose not to lead their brigades in person, remaining behind their advance.<ref>Coddington, pp. 289-90; Martin, pp. 226, 237; Pfanz, p. 178.</ref> After the battle there were rumors among the North Carolinians that Iverson was too drunk to lead, but his battle report indicated that he deliberately chose to remain behind and historians present no evidence that alcohol was involved in his decision.<ref>Pfanz, p. 177; Sears, p. 201; Martin, p. 227.</ref>\n\nIn the words of the historian of the 23rd North Carolina, \"unwarned, unled as a brigade, went forward Iverson's deserted band to its doom.\"<ref>Sears, p. 199.</ref> As O'Neal's men fell back, Iverson's 1,350 men began to drift left toward a stone wall behind which veteran regiments of Brig. Gen. [[Henry Baxter]]'s Union brigade were hidden. As the Confederates approached within 50 to 100 yards of the wall, the Union soldiers opened fire, hitting at least 500 men, felling them almost in parade-ground alignment. Most of the survivors of three of Iverson's regiments were captured by a Union countercharge.<ref>Coddington, pp. 289-90; Martin, pp. 227-29, 236; Pfanz, pp. 172-73; Sears, p. 172.</ref>\n\nFrom Iverson's vantage point, it seemed as if his brigade was surrendering, and he exclaimed to Rodes that his men were \"cowards\". Many of his men lay prone in battle formation while others waved white handkerchiefs. He did not realize that the former were dead or wounded and the latter surrounded and trapped under heavy fire. Upon reaching the front after conferring with Rodes, Iverson may have suffered a nervous breakdown, overwhelmed by the fate his men had suffered, possibly as many as 900 casualties, one of the most significant brigade losses at Gettysburg.<ref>Martin, p. 236.</ref> (The men were later buried in shallow graves on this spot on Oak Ridge, which is known to locals as Iverson's Pits, and is a favorite site for believers in the [[supernatural]].) Iverson was \"unfit for command\" for the rest of the battle.<ref>Coddington, p. 290; Martin, p. 238; Sears, p. 201.</ref> He commanded fragments of his brigade attached to the brigade of Brig. Gen. [[Stephen Dodson Ramseur]].<ref>Tagg, p. 297.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[retreat from Gettysburg]], Iverson's brigade fought credibly against Union cavalry in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], but Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] wanted nothing more to do with the tarnished officer.<ref name=Hewitt143>Hewitt, p. 143.</ref> At [[Williamsport, Maryland]], Lee assigned Iverson as temporary provost marshal, which removed him from combat command, reassigning his men to another brigade.<ref>Freeman, vol. 3, pp. 198-201.</ref>\n\n===Georgia and North Carolina===\nHe was removed altogether from the Army of Northern Virginia in October 1863, ordered back to Georgia to replace Maj. Gen. [[Henry R. Jackson]] in command of the state forces, headquartered at [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]]. He spent several months reorganizing the Georgia troops in preparation for the defense of the state against Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]]'s [[Atlanta Campaign]].<ref name=Hewitt143/>\n\nIn 1864, Iverson commanded a cavalry brigade in Maj. Gen. [[William T. Martin]]'s division, Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Wheeler]]'s cavalry corps, during the Atlanta Campaign. On July 29, near [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], Iverson's 1,300 cavalrymen defeated about 2,300 under Maj. Gen. [[George Stoneman]], taking about 200 prisoners. During Iverson's pursuit, he and his men captured an additional 500 at Sunshine Church on July 31, including Stoneman.<ref>Castel, p. 442; Hewitt, p. 143.</ref>\n\nIverson was on duty in [[North Carolina]] at the end of the war. As commander in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] he watched his garrison slip away until it was unable to stop fugitive soldiers from plundering part of the city.<ref>Bradley, p. 153.</ref>\n\n==Postbellum career==\n[[File:Alfrediversonjr.jpg|thumb|Grave of Alfred Iverson Jr., Oakland Cemetery, Atlanta, Georgia]]\n\nAfter the war, Iverson engaged in business at Macon, moving to Florida in 1877 to farm oranges. He died in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and is buried there in [[Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta, Georgia)|Oakland Cemetery]].<ref name=Hewitt143/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n* [[List of American Civil War Generals (Confederate)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Bradley, Mark L.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. ....

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. ....

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Piper's served as a training facility in 1897 for heavyweight boxing champion [[James J. Corbett|Gentleman Jim Corbett]], in preparation for his title bout with [[Bob Fitzsimmons]]. The current structure was built by entrepreneur John Piper in 1885 to replace his 1878 opera house that had burned down. The 1878 venue, in turn, had been to replace Piper's 1863 venue which was destroyed by the 1875 Great Fire in Virginia City. [[Mark Twain]] spoke from the original Piper's stage in 1866, and again a century later in the third venue, as portrayed by [[Hal Holbrook]] in his one-man play ''Mark Twain Tonight!''  A lynch mob hung a victim from the first venue's rafters in 1871. American theatrical producer [[David Belasco]] was stage manager at the second opera house before moving to New York City.  Piper's opera houses played host to Shakespearean thespians such as [[Edwin Booth]]. Musical performers [[Lilly Langtry]], [[Al Jolson]] and [[John Philip Sousa]] once performed here.  In 1940, [[Errol Flynn]] auctioned off historic Piper memorabilia from the opera house stage, during a live [[NBC]] broadcast that coincided with the premiere of Flynn's new movie ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]''.\n\n==John Piper==\nGerman immigrant John Piper arrived in Virginia City as part of the 1860 [[Comstock Lode]] rush, after several years in San Francisco operating a liquor and seasonal fruit stand near San Francisco's theaters.<ref>Carolyn Grattan Eichin, \"The Piper Brothers' Business of Amusements: Piper's Corner Bar,\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly 56 (Fall Winter 2013), 151-166 </Ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Susan|title=John Piper|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/john_piper|encyclopedia=The Online Nevada Encyclopedia|publisher=Nevada Humanities|accessdate=7 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513111253/http://www.onlinenevada.org/john_piper|archivedate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThrough business acumen and a political career, Piper would become one of the richest men in 1870s Virginia City.<ref name=\"Eichin2020\">{{Cite book |last=Eichin, Carolyn Grattan|title=From San Francisco eastward : Victorian theater in the American West |year=2020 |isbn=978-1-948908-38-2 |location=Reno |oclc=1125080176}}</ref>{{rp|30-31}} Piper sat on the City Council in 1865,<ref name=\"Ashes\">{{cite journal|last=Difrancia|first=Chic|title=From the Ashes|journal=Nevada Magazine|date=January\u2013February 2009|url=http://www.nevadamagazine.com/issues/read/from_the_ashes/|accessdate=7 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529084909/http://www.nevadamagazine.com/issues/read/from_the_ashes/|archivedate=29 May 2011}}</ref> and was mayor of Virginia City in 1867.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Journal of the Senate|year=1867|publisher=Nevada Legislature Senate|page=248}}</ref>\nIn 1874, Piper represented Storey County in the [[Nevada Senate]].

Piper's served as a training facility in 1897 for heavyweight boxing champion [[James J. Corbett|Gentleman Jim Corbett]], in preparation for his title bout with [[Bob Fitzsimmons]]. The current structure was built by entrepreneur John Piper in 1885 to replace his 1878 opera house that had burned down. The 1878 venue, in turn, had been to replace Piper's 1863 venue which was destroyed by the 1875 Great Fire in Virginia City. [[Mark Twain]] spoke from the original Piper's stage in 1866, and again a century later in the third venue, as portrayed by [[Hal Holbrook]] in his one-man play ''Mark Twain Tonight!''  A lynch mob hung a victim from the first venue's rafters in 1871. American theatrical producer [[David Belasco]] was stage manager at the second opera house before moving to New York City.  Piper's opera houses played host to Shakespearean thespians such as [[Edwin Booth]]. Musical performers [[Lilly Langtry]], [[Al Jolson]] and [[John Philip Sousa]] once performed here.  In 1940, [[Errol Flynn]] auctioned off historic Piper memorabilia from the opera house stage, during a live [[NBC]] broadcast that coincided with the premiere of Flynn's new movie ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]''.\n\n==John Piper==\nGerman immigrant John Piper arrived in Virginia City as part of the 1860 [[Comstock Lode]] rush, after several years in San Francisco operating a liquor and seasonal fruit stand near San Francisco's theaters.<ref>Carolyn Grattan Eichin, \"The Piper Brothers' Business of Amusements: Piper's Corner Bar,\" Nevada Historical Society Quarterly 56 (Fall Winter 2013), 151-166 </Ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Susan|title=John Piper|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/john_piper|encyclopedia=The Online Nevada Encyclopedia|publisher=Nevada Humanities|accessdate=7 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513111253/http://www.onlinenevada.org/john_piper|archivedate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThrough business acumen and a political career, Piper would become one of the richest men in 1870s Virginia City.<ref name=\"Eichin2020\">{{Cite book |last=Eichin, Carolyn Grattan|title=From San Francisco eastward : Victorian theater in the American West |year=2020 |isbn=978-1-948908-38-2 |location=Reno |oclc=1125080176}}</ref>{{rp|30-31}} Piper sat on the City Council in 1865,<ref name=\"Ashes\">{{cite journal|last=Difrancia|first=Chic|title=From the Ashes|journal=Nevada Magazine|date=January\u2013February 2009|url=http://www.nevadamagazine.com/issues/read/from_the_ashes/|accessdate=7 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529084909/http://www.nevadamagazine.com/issues/read/from_the_ashes/|archivedate=29 May 2011}}</ref> and was mayor of Virginia City in 1867.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Journal of the Senate|year=1867|publisher=Nevada Legislature Senate|page=248}}</ref>\nIn 1874, Piper represented Storey County in the [[Nevada Senate]].
