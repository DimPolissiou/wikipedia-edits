''O. unilateralis'' infects [[ant]]s of the [[Camponotini]] tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mongkolsamrit S, Kobmoo N, Tasanathai K, Khonsanit A, Noisripoom W, Srikitikulchai P, Somnuk R, Luangsa-ard JJ | title = Life cycle, host range and temporal variation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''/''Hirsutella formicarium'' on Formicine ants | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u201324 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22959811 | doi = 10.1016/j.jip.2012.08.007 }}</ref> The process leading to mortality takes 4\u201310 days, and includes a reproductive stage where [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. ''O. unilateralis'' is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.\n\n''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' and related species are known to engage in an active [[secondary metabolism]], among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform [[ascospores]] and cylindrical [[asci]].<ref name = \"Sung2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Gi-Ho |last2=Hywel-Jones |first2=Nigel L. |last3=Sung |first3=Jae-Mo |last4=Luangsa-ard |first4=J.

However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to re-classify the ''Clavicipitaceae'' family. It was found that \u2018\u2019Clavicipitaceae\u2019\u2019 was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the ''Clavicipitaceae'', the ''Cordycipitaceae'' and the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.<ref name = \"Sung2007\"/>\n \nThe new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all ''Cordyceps'' species forming a sister group with ''Tolypocladium'', into ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''. Fungi able to parasitize ants were also included in the transfer, such as ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' which was later renamed ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/> Following this study, multiple traits such as the production of darkly pigmented, hard to flexible [[stromata]] were defined as characteristics of the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae'' family.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nConsequently, as phylogenetic tools improved, ''O. unilateralis'' was moved from ''Cordyceps'' to ''Ophiocordyceps''.

In 2011, it was hypothesized that the zombie-ant fungus could actually be described as a complex of species which are host-specific, meaning that one ''O. unilateralis'' species can only successfully infect one host ant species.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\"/> Consequently, there is a possibility that this resulted in or re-inforced the reproductive isolation of the fungi, leading to its speciation. Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different ''Ophiocordyceps'' species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. These findings provided increasing evidence for ''O. unilateralis'' being actually a complex a species.<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\nMore recently in 2018, 15 new species were described. They first used classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology in order to delimit and classify species composing ''O. unilateralis s.l.''. \nThe asexual morphologies enabled to distinguish two different [[clades]] mainly composed of [[myrmecophilous|species associated with ants]] which they termed \u201c''O. unilateralis'' core clade\u201d and \u201c''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade\u201d.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nAfterwards, in the same study, they conducted further analysis using a set of different traits. They used morphological traits analysis which included both macro-morphological characters and microscopic traits. The macro-morphological characteristics consist of: the typical single stroma arising from the host\u2019s dorsal pronotum, the [[ascoma]] (perithecia) growing from the stroma. The microscopic traits consisted of: the morphology of the ascospores in terms of size, shape, [[septation]] and germination. Finally, they used other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nWith these analyses, they identified different morphologies which enabled them to distribute 14 new species within the core clade, and one within the sub-clade. Moreover, species in the ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade specialized on [[neotropical]] ants, whereas species in the core clade specialized on ''Camponotini'' species.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n\n'''Species within the ''O. unilateralis'' core clade as described in 2018'''<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>:\n* ''O. albacongiuae''\n* ''O. blakebarnesii''\n* ''O. camponoti-atricipis''\n* ''O. camponoti-balzani''\n* ''O. camponoti-bispinosi''\n* ''O. camponoti-chartificis''\n* ''O. camponoti-femorati''\n* ''O. camponoti-floridani''\n* ''O. camponoti-hippocrepidis''\n* ''O. camponoti-indiani''\n* ''O. camponoti-leonardi''\n* ''O. camponoti- melanotic''\n* ''O. camponoti-nidulantis''\n* ''O. camponoti-novogranadensis''\n* ''O. camponoti-renggeri''\n* ''O. camponoti-saundersi''\n* ''O. halabalaensis''\n* ''O. kimflemingiae''\n* ''O. naomipierceae''\n* ''O. ootakii''\n* ''O. polyrhachis-furcata''\n* ''O. pulvinata''\n* ''O. rami''\n* ''O. satoi''\n\n\n'''Species within the ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade as described in 2018'''<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>:\n* ''O. daceti''\n* ''O. kniphofioides''\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n[[File:Schematic drawing of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis morphology on an infected ant.png|thumb|350px|right|Schematic representation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' growing out of an infected host ant]]\n\n=== Typical morphology ===\n\nThe zombie-ant fungus is easily identifiable when its reproductive structure becomes apparent on its dead host, usually a carpenter ant.

Different [[sub-species]] of ant can occur within the same area, which means that in order to coexist they have to occupy different [[ecological niches]]. Consequently, the fungi may have evolved at the subspecies level in order to maximize its [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. unilateralis'' core clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. unilateralis'' core clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, has distinct morphological characteristics. It exhibits a single stroma with a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph, which arises from the dorsal neck region of the dead ant and produces a dark brown perithecia attached to its stalk.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nThese species are also recognizable through the host species they infect, which are only ''Camponotini'' species.

Its species produce a stroma that grows laterally from the host\u2019s thorax which itself generates an orange [[ascoma]]. Moreover, species within this sub-clade share a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nAs for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The sub-clade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d that O. unilateralis species typically exhibit. Their hosts usually die at the base of large trees in the Amazonian rainforest, among the moss carpets.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\nLike other fungi pathogenic to insects in the genus ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'', ''O. unilateralis'' targets a specific host species, ''Camponotus Leonardi''. However, the fungus may parasitize other closely related species of ants with lesser degrees of host manipulation and reproductive success.<ref name=Sample />\n\nThe changes in the behavior of the infected ants are very specific, giving rise to the popular term \"zombie ants\", and are tuned for the benefit of the fungus. The spores of the fungus attach to and eventually break through the ant's exoskeleton using mechanical pressure and enzymes.<ref name=\"pmc-3204140\" /> Yeast stages of the fungus spread in the ant's body and presumably produce compounds that affect the ant's [[hemocoel]], using the evolutionary trait of an [[extended phenotype]] to manipulate the behavioral patterns exhibited by the ant.<ref name=\"Andersen\" /> An infected ant exhibits irregularly timed full-body convulsions that dislodge it to the forest floor.<ref name=\"Hughes, D.

For this purpose, the fungus\u2019 [[hypha]] pierces the [[exoskeleton]] using enzymes such as [[chitinase]], [[lipase]] and [[protease]], combined with mechanical pressure.<ref name=pmc-3204140/>\n\n* '''Convulsions and climbing behaviour'''<br>\n\nAfter the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells can be found beside the host\u2019s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the fungus which secretes different metabolites according to host species.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\nMany studies describe ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' distribution as [[pantropical]] since it occurs mainly in [[tropical forest]] ecosystems<ref name = \"EvansHC2011\"/>.

To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure. Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

''O. unilateralis'' infects [[ant]]s of the [[Camponotini]] tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mongkolsamrit S, Kobmoo N, Tasanathai K, Khonsanit A, Noisripoom W, Srikitikulchai P, Somnuk R, Luangsa-ard JJ | title = Life cycle, host range and temporal variation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''/''Hirsutella formicarium'' on Formicine ants | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u201324 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22959811 | doi = 10.1016/j.jip.2012.08.007 }}</ref> The process leading to mortality takes 4\u201310 days, and includes a reproductive stage where [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. ''O. unilateralis'' is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.\n\n''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' and related species are known to engage in an active [[secondary metabolism]], among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform [[ascospores]] and cylindrical [[asci]].<ref name = \"Sung2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Gi-Ho |last2=Hywel-Jones |first2=Nigel L. |last3=Sung |first3=Jae-Mo |last4=Luangsa-ard |first4=J.

However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to re-classify the ''Clavicipitaceae'' family. It was found that \u2018\u2019Clavicipitaceae\u2019\u2019 was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the ''Clavicipitaceae'', the ''Cordycipitaceae'' and the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.<ref name = \"Sung2007\"/>\n \nThe new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all ''Cordyceps'' species forming a sister group with ''Tolypocladium'', into ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''. Fungi able to parasitize ants were also included in the transfer, such as ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' which was later renamed ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/> Following this study, multiple traits such as the production of darkly pigmented, hard to flexible [[stromata]] were defined as characteristics of the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae'' family.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nConsequently, as phylogenetic tools improved, ''O. unilateralis'' was moved from ''Cordyceps'' to ''Ophiocordyceps''.

In 2011, it was hypothesized that the zombie-ant fungus could actually be described as a complex of species which are host-specific, meaning that one ''O. unilateralis'' species can only successfully infect one host ant species.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\"/> Consequently, there is a possibility that this resulted in or re-inforced the reproductive isolation of the fungi, leading to its speciation. Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different ''Ophiocordyceps'' species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. These findings provided increasing evidence for ''O. unilateralis'' being actually a complex a species.<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\nMore recently in 2018, 15 new species were described. They first used classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology in order to delimit and classify species composing ''O. unilateralis s.l.''. \nThe asexual morphologies enabled to distinguish two different [[clades]] mainly composed of [[myrmecophilous|species associated with ants]] which they termed \u201c''O. unilateralis'' core clade\u201d and \u201c''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade\u201d.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nAfterwards, in the same study, they conducted further analysis using a set of different traits. They used morphological traits analysis which included both macro-morphological characters and microscopic traits. The macro-morphological characteristics consist of: the typical single stroma arising from the host\u2019s dorsal pronotum, the [[ascoma]] (perithecia) growing from the stroma. The microscopic traits consisted of: the morphology of the ascospores in terms of size, shape, [[septation]] and germination. Finally, they used other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nWith these analyses, they identified different morphologies which enabled them to distribute 14 new species within the core clade, and one within the sub-clade. Moreover, species in the ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade specialized on [[neotropical]] ants, whereas species in the core clade specialized on ''Camponotini'' species.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n\n'''Species within the ''O. unilateralis'' core clade as described in 2018'''<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>:\n* ''O. albacongiuae''\n* ''O. blakebarnesii''\n* ''O. camponoti-atricipis''\n* ''O. camponoti-balzani''\n* ''O. camponoti-bispinosi''\n* ''O. camponoti-chartificis''\n* ''O. camponoti-femorati''\n* ''O. camponoti-floridani''\n* ''O. camponoti-hippocrepidis''\n* ''O. camponoti-indiani''\n* ''O. camponoti-leonardi''\n* ''O. camponoti- melanotic''\n* ''O. camponoti-nidulantis''\n* ''O. camponoti-novogranadensis''\n* ''O. camponoti-renggeri''\n* ''O. camponoti-saundersi''\n* ''O. halabalaensis''\n* ''O. kimflemingiae''\n* ''O. naomipierceae''\n* ''O. ootakii''\n* ''O. polyrhachis-furcata''\n* ''O. pulvinata''\n* ''O. rami''\n* ''O. satoi''\n\n\n'''Species within the ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade as described in 2018'''<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>:\n* ''O. daceti''\n* ''O. kniphofioides''\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n[[File:Schematic drawing of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis morphology on an infected ant.png|thumb|350px|right|Schematic representation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' growing out of an infected host ant]]\n\n=== Typical morphology ===\n\nThe zombie-ant fungus is easily identifiable when its reproductive structure becomes apparent on its dead host, usually a carpenter ant.

Generally, the asexual morphs identified for ''Ophiocordyceps'' are ''[[Hirsutella]]'' and ''[[Hymenostilbe]]'', two genera of asexually reproducing fungi.<ref name=pmc-3204140/><br>\n\n=== Morphological variation ===\n\n''O. unilateralis'' species exhibit morphological variations which are most certainly due to their wide geographic range, from Japan to the Americas. \nMoreover, it has been hypothesized that their morphological variations may also be a result of one fungus species maximizing its infection on one specific host ant species (host-specific infections). Different [[sub-species]] of ant can occur within the same area, which means that in order to coexist they have to occupy different [[ecological niches]]. Consequently, the fungi may have evolved at the subspecies level in order to maximize its [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. unilateralis'' core clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. unilateralis'' core clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, has distinct morphological characteristics. It exhibits a single stroma with a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph, which arises from the dorsal neck region of the dead ant and produces a dark brown perithecia attached to its stalk.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nThese species are also recognizable through the host species they infect, which are only ''Camponotini'' species. Once the host is killed by the fungus, it is commonly found fixed through their mandibles onto the surfaces of leaves.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n'''''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade morphological characteristics'''<br>\n\nThe ''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade, as described by Araujo et al in 2018, also has distinct morphological characteristics. Its species produce a stroma that grows laterally from the host\u2019s thorax which itself generates an orange [[ascoma]]. Moreover, species within this sub-clade share a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nAs for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The sub-clade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d that O. unilateralis species typically exhibit. Their hosts usually die at the base of large trees in the Amazonian rainforest, among the moss carpets.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n\nLike other fungi pathogenic to insects in the genus ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'', ''O. unilateralis'' targets a specific host species, ''Camponotus Leonardi''. However, the fungus may parasitize other closely related species of ants with lesser degrees of host manipulation and reproductive success.<ref name=Sample />\n\nThe changes in the behavior of the infected ants are very specific, giving rise to the popular term \"zombie ants\", and are tuned for the benefit of the fungus. The spores of the fungus attach to and eventually break through the ant's exoskeleton using mechanical pressure and enzymes.<ref name=\"pmc-3204140\" /> Yeast stages of the fungus spread in the ant's body and presumably produce compounds that affect the ant's [[hemocoel]], using the evolutionary trait of an [[extended phenotype]] to manipulate the behavioral patterns exhibited by the ant.<ref name=\"Andersen\" /> An infected ant exhibits irregularly timed full-body convulsions that dislodge it to the forest floor.<ref name=\"Hughes, D.

For this purpose, the fungus\u2019 [[hypha]] pierces the [[exoskeleton]] using enzymes such as [[chitinase]], [[lipase]] and [[protease]], combined with mechanical pressure.<ref name=pmc-3204140/>\n\n* '''Convulsions and climbing behaviour'''<br>\n\nAfter the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells can be found beside the host\u2019s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the fungus which secretes different metabolites according to host species.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\nMany studies describe ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' distribution as [[pantropical]] since it occurs mainly in [[tropical forest]] ecosystems<ref name = \"EvansHC2011\"/>.

To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure.[4][5] Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.  While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn\u2019t release oxygen to the organs and tissues.<ref name=\"Bernard2013 \"> {{cite journal  | authors= Forget B and Bunn H|title= Classification of the Disorders of Hemoglobin |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|volume= 3 |date= 2013|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a011684}}</ref> The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions. \n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used.

This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin. Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\">{{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }}</ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.  While hemoglobin Barts is very efficient at binding oxygen, it doesn\u2019t release oxygen to the organs and tissues.<ref name=\"Bernard2013 \"> {{cite journal  | authors= Forget B and Bunn H|title= Classification of the Disorders of Hemoglobin |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|volume= 3 |date= 2013|doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a011684}}</ref> The disease is fatal for the fetus or newborn unless early diagnosis and intervention is carried out during pregnancy, and the child will be dependent on lifelong blood transfusions. \n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the minimum concentration of oxygen needed for 50% of the hemoglobin molecules to bind to it.<ref name=\"Vibhu2006\">{{Cite book | authors= Awasthi V, Goins E and Phillips W| title= Blood Substitutes| year=2006 | chapter=Chapter 43 \u2013 Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin: history, preparation and evaluation | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-759760-7}}</ref> For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A. This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin.

As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

From its inception, the band's line-up included songwriters [[Rory Macdonald (musician)|Rory Macdonald]] and [[Calum MacDonald (musician)|Calum Macdonald]]. The line-up during most of the 1980s and 1990s (the band's most successful period) also included [[Donnie Munro]], Malcolm Jones, Iain Bayne, and [[Pete Wishart]]. Munro left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics and was replaced by [[Bruce Guthro]]. Wishart left in 2001 and was replaced by Brian Hurren. The band released fourteen [[studio album]]s, with a number of their songs sung in [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nInitially formed as a three-piece dance band known as 'The Run Rig Dance Band', the band played several low key events, and has previously cited a [[ceilidh]] at Kelvin Hall, [[Glasgow]] as their first concert.<ref>{{cite web|title=#tbt 43 years ago today we played our first \"concert\", a ceilidh in the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow! Time flies.|url=https://twitter.com/runrig1973/status/725692295245357056|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> Runrig's music is often described as a blend of [[folk music|folk]] and [[rock music|rock]] music, with the band's lyrics often focusing upon locations, history, politics, and people that are unique to Scotland. Songs also make references to [[agriculture]], land conservation and religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/3687-runrig|title=Runrig - Artist Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nSince 1999, the band has gained attention in [[Canada]], following [[Nova Scotia]]n singer Bruce Guthro's entry to the band. In 2016, the band announced that it would retire from studio recording after the release of its 14th studio album, ''[[The Story (Runrig album)|The Story]]''<ref>{{cite web|last1=RICK FULTON|title=Runrig release their final album but insist it's not the end of The Story|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/runrig-release-final-album-insist-7267508|website=Daily Record|accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref> and announced their final tour ''The Last Mile'' in 2017.

Douglas left the band in late 1974 and was replaced by Robert Macdonald. This line-up continued until 1978, when Douglas re-joined and [[Malcolm Jones (musician)|Malcolm Jones]] became [[guitarist]], both displacing Robert Macdonald.\n\nIn the same year, Runrig's first album, entitled ''[[Play Gaelic]]'', was released. All the songs were in Gaelic. It was re-released in 1990 as ''Play Gaelic, the first legendary recording''.\n\nIn 1979, Blair Douglas left Runrig again to pursue a solo career. 1979 also saw the release of Runrig's second album, ''[[The Highland Connection]]'' on the band's own label, Ridge Records. A somewhat transitional album, it features wailing [[electric guitar]]s and  [[ballad]]s. The album also included the original version of \"[[Loch Lomond#The song|Loch Lomond]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/music/features/thetradtop100.shtml |title=In final BBC shortlist for top traditional Scottish song |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> A later version was to become their signature song and closing song at concerts.\n\nThe third Runrig album, ''[[Recovery (1981 album)|Recovery]]'' (released in 1981), was a [[concept album|thematic record]] dealing with the rise and politics of Scotland's Gaelic community. 1980 saw the arrival of [[drummer]] Iain Bayne (from Scottish folk/rock band [[New Celeste]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/play/b0bgbvkr|title=BBC Radio Scotland - 22/08/2018|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and [[synthesizer|keyboard]] player Richard Cherns.\n\nIn 1982, Runrig re-recorded \"Loch Lomond\" as their first single. They signed to a small label called Simple Records in 1984, and two singles were released. The first was \"Dance Called America\". A longer version of the second single \"Skye\" appeared on the Alba Records [[compilation album|compilation]] ''A Feast Of Scottish Folk Music, Volume One'' along with an early version of \"Lifeline\", both of which were previously unreleased on albums, and \"Na h-Uain a's t-Earrach\" which was the [[B-side]] to \"Dance Called America\".\n\nThe band then engaged the services of producer [[Chris Rainbow|Chris Harley]] who brought to their recordings the benefit of his experience as a solo artist and a singer with The Alan Parsons Project and Camel.  Runrig's fourth independent studio album, ''[[Heartland (Runrig album)|''Heartland'']]'' (released in 1985), combined Gaelic sounds with anthemic rock music.\n\nRichard Cherns left the band in February 1986 and was replaced by ex-[[Big Country]] member [[Pete Wishart]].\n\n=== Major label and mainstream success (1987\u20131997) ===\n\nThe period from 1987\u20131997 marked Runrig's most successful run, during which they achieved placings in both the UK albums and singles charts, and toured extensively.\n\nWith (for the first time) major-label support (from [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]]), Runrig's fifth studio album, ''The Cutter And The Clan'' (1987), which had originally been released on the independent Ridge Records label before being re-released on Chrysalis, brought the band wider audiences in the United Kingdom, as well as in other parts of Europe.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1995, Runrig released a total of five studio albums through Chrysalis Records. Along with ''The Cutter And The Clan'', the other four albums were: ''Searchlight'' (1989), ''The Big Wheel'' (1991), ''Amazing Things'' (1993), and ''Mara'' (1995).\n\nOn 22 June 1991, the band attracted around 50,000 people to an outdoor concert held in [[Balloch Country Park]], near Loch Lomond. This was the largest number of people to attend a Runrig concert.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Mara'', lead singer Donnie Munro grew more involved in politics. In 1997, he left Runrig in order to stand for a seat in the House of Commons for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. However, he was not elected.\n\nRunrig began searching for a new frontman, and in 1998 they announced their selection of Bruce Guthro, a [[singer-songwriter]] from [[Nova Scotia]].\n\n=== Transitional challenges (1997 to 2001) ===\nRunrig's tenth album, ''[[In Search Of Angels]]'' (1999), was released amidst some uncertainty about the band's future.\n\nSince their contract with Chrysalis had ended, Runrig chose to release ''In Search Of Angels'' on their own label, Ridge Records. As a result, the record received much less promotion than the previous five, and sales were considerably smaller. Runrig was also faced with the challenge of acclimatising their fans to a new [[lead vocalist]]. The band toured extensively in support of the record, and in 2000, they also released a live album called ''[[Live at Celtic Connections 2000|Live At Celtic Connections 2000]]'', allowing fans to hear older Runrig songs sung by their new frontman.\n\nThe year 2000 concluded with the release of an authorised songbook, ''Flower Of The West - The Runrig Songbook''. The book included lyrics, sheet music, photographs, and background information for 115 of Runrig's songs - nearly every album track and single from the band's first ten studio albums.\n\n===Renewed popularity (2001\u20132009)===\nHaving established that they could continue without Donnie Munro, Runrig set to work on their eleventh studio album.\n\nAmong their independently-released studio albums, ''[[The Stamping Ground]]'' (2001) was Runrig's most successful.  Moreover, critics who had given mixed reviews to ''In Search Of Angels'', praised ''The Stamping Ground'' as the quintessential Runrig album. The band continued to enjoy support in the UK, Germany, and Denmark. However, with a Canadian frontman, Runrig began finding new fans in Canada and the United States.\n\nIn [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], [[Pete Wishart]], the band's keyboard player, left after being elected [[Member of Parliament]] for the constituency of [[Tayside North (UK Parliament constituency)|Tayside North]] for the [[Scottish National Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/key_people/newsid_1179000/1179393.stm |title=Pete Wishart: SNP |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-03-22 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2174505.stm |title=BBC profile of Peter Wishart |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-10-16 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/2041027.stm |title=Rock MP takes on music pirates |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-06-12 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]] he was again elected, this time for the new constituency of [[Perth and North Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and North Perthshire]] and again for the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/05/11/mp4_music_feature.shtml |title=MP4 strike a chord with voters |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-05-13 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> Brian Hurren stepped in to take Wishart's place in the band.  {{As of|March 2019|post=,}} Wishart has been re-elected in each subsequent general election, albeit with a [[marginal seat|very slim majority]] in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].\n\nThe 2001 album ''[[The Stamping Ground]]'' was seen very much as a return to form after the lacklustre ''[[In Search Of Angels]]'' (1999), but 2003's ''[[Proterra (album)|Proterra]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/folk/reviews/proterra.shtml |title=BBC review of Proterra |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/entertainment/louder/love/runrig/ |title=Runrig at the Sands Centre |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> divided opinion.\n\nIn August 2003, Runrig played their 30th Anniversary concert on the esplanade at Stirling Castle, celebrating 30 years since the band's formation, and including visitors from previous line-ups, as well as guest artists including the Glasgow Islay Choir and Paul Mounsey.\n\nRunrig played their first U.S. concert, a benefit for the charity \"Glasgow the Caring City\", on 4 April 2006 at the Nokia Theatre in New York City.  Founding member Blair Douglas joined the band onstage, playing accordion on several numbers.  In the audience were fans from as far away as [[Texas]], [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Colorado]], [[Minnesota]], Norwich (England) and Scotland.\n\nWhile the bulk of their 2007 tour was scheduled for Denmark, Germany, and England, an outdoor show, titled \"Beat The Drum\", was held at [[Loch Ness]] on 18 August 2007. It was staged at Borlum Farm, [[Drumnadrochit]] and attended by 18,500 people in heavy rain. Because of the unusually large number of support acts, it had been likened to an all-day music festival, Runrig being the headline act.<ref>{{cite news|author=Raymond Buchanan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6954703.stm |title=Fans beat the mud to see heroes |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> This was the first in what was to become a staple for Runrig - annually staging big outdoor shows in Scotland in summer.\n\nRunrig re-recorded \"[[The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond|Loch Lomond]] (Hampden Remix)\" to raise funds for the BBC's annual [[Children In Need]] appeal. This was released on 12 November [2007] and includes the '[[Tartan Army]]' (Scotland's Hampden Football Supporters), including [[Rod Stewart]], on backing vocals. It reached #9 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n\"Loch Lomond (Hampden Remix)\" was named \"The Best Scottish Song Of All Time\" in November 2008.

They were supported by acts such as the [[Peatbog Faeries]], piper Fred Morrison, [[King Creosote]], Kathleen Macinnes, and Blair Douglas (a former member of the group) and his band. Attendance numbered ~15,000.<br/>The show was part of Scotland's Year of Homecoming 2009. In order to underline this, [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] made an appearance on stage (introduced by his [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] colleague and former band member [[Pete Wishart]]), and launched an initiative called 'SconeStone.' This aims to promote [[Scotland]] as a kind and compassionate nation through the \"journey of kindness\" made by the SconeStone across the world. Its keepers, each holding it for a week before passing it on, are expected to undertake a good deed. Its first keeper was the Reverend Neil Galbraith, who was presented with the stone on the same day.\n\n=== Health concerns (2009\u20132010) ===\nIn March 2009, guitarist Malcolm Jones suffered a [[heart attack]] in [[Edinburgh]] whilst running to catch a train.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7934676.stm |title=UK &#124; Scotland &#124; Edinburgh, East and Fife &#124; Runrig guitarist Jones collapses |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> This forced the band to cancel a sizable tour of Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Germany. After undergoing minor surgery, he took to the stage with Runrig again in May of the same year. During a routine check up with his doctors in June 2009, he was strongly advised to have [[heart bypass]] surgery, which forced the band to cancel a tour of Denmark.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8107396.stm |title=Scotland &#124; Edinburgh, East and Fife &#124; Heart bypass for Runrig guitarist |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> The operation was a success and, although the band was forced to cancel their show at the 35th [[T\u00f8nder Festival]] in [[T\u00f8nder]], Denmark, Malcolm returned to the stage in late August 2009, at the band's big outdoor Scottish [[Homecoming Scotland 2009|Homecoming]] show for 2009 at [[Scone Palace]], [[Perthshire]], Scotland. However, on 28 February 2010, just a week prior to an extensive German tour, it was announced that Malcolm would have to have yet another operation which in turn forced the band to cancel/postpone their Spring dates in [[Germany]], due to start on 3 March 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/8542891.stm |title=Implant operation for Runrig guitarist Malcolm Jones |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> In a statement released by the band on their official website they noted that Malcolm's health was \"good\" and that the problem was \"purely a technical one\". They also emphatically stated that \"All other concerts planned for 2010 will go ahead.\"\nIt was announced that the winter tour scheduled for winter 2010 would be the last tour for a year with the band planning no concerts in 2011 so that they can focus on other projects. The final date for 2010 was in the [[Barrowland Ballroom]], [[Glasgow]] which is traditionally where the band finishes their Scottish tours. In a statement released by the office, they promised it to be \"quite a party\".\n\nOn 1 November 2010, the band released a four-disc compilation, entitled ''[[50 Great Songs]]''. The release includes both studio and live performances, focusing primarily upon Bruce Guthro's time within the band.\n\n=== Year off and ''Rewired'' (2011\u20132012) ===\nAfter the end of the 2010 tour the band collectively made the decision to take a year off. \nCalum and Rory had been concentrating on a long gestating project outside of Runrig. The duo call themselves [[The Band from Rockall]] and released their debut album outside of Runrig at the end of April 2012.\nKeyboardist Brian Hurren also released his debut solo album, which he wrote, performed and produced himself, under the name ''A Hundred Thousand Welcomes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahtw.co.uk/ |title=ahtw.co.uk |publisher=ahtw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> the inspiration for the name coming from Bruce Guthro shouting the Gaelic equivalent of the phrase during \"Beat the Drum\" at Loch Ness. \nGuthro released another solo album, while drummer Iain Bayne was appointed manager of English [[folk-rock]] band [[Coast (folk rock band)|Coast]]. \nThe band re-united as a six-piece again in the summer of 2012 for the Rewired Tour, with the big Scottish outdoor show held in August at the Northern Meeting Park in [[Inverness]].\n\n=== 40th anniversary (2013\u20132014) ===\nIn November 2012, ahead of their planned Rewired Tour, the band announced a special 40th Anniversary Concert at the Black Isle Show Ground in [[Muir of Ord]], near [[Inverness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safeconcerts.com/festivals/runrig-party-on-the-moor-the-40th-anniversary-weekend/ |title=Runrig \u2018Party On The Moor\u2019 the 40th anniversary weekend 2013|publisher=Safeconcerts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> The 40th Anniversary show was a weekend of live entertainment featuring 'special guests', entitled \"Party On The Moor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-23620167 |title=BBC News - Runrig holds 40th anniversary bash |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> Shortly after that they announced another \"special\" concert at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in July, entitled \"Celebration In The City\".

The gig was hailed as a success by fans and critics many calling it one of the best concerts Runrig have ever staged.

Entitled \"Party on the Tour\" it would \"draw inspiration\" from the Party on the Moor show. Alongside the English dates, several European [[music festivals]] were announced for 2014. In December 2013 it was officially confirmed that Party on the Moor would be released on DVD. In January further details for the DVD were released.

In the summer 2015 issue of The Wire it was revealed that the album would be called ''[[The Story (Runrig album)|The Story]]'', and would be released in spring 2016.\nOn 12 November 2015 the title track, and lead single, received its first radio play on [[BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal]].

On 13 November 2015, the single was released in both [[CD]] and [[Music download|digital download]] form accompanied by a [[music video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runrig.co.uk/?p=302|title=Welcome|author=|date=|website=Runrig - The Story|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref> Shortly after the single was released, the band announced that along with a sizeable tour of the UK and Europe in 2016 they would both be headlining the 21st [[HebCelt]] Festival on the [[Isle of Lewis]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-34908414|title=Runrig to headline HebCelt festival|author=|date=24 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and staging an outdoor show at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in July 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/runrig-to-stage-edinburgh-castle-gig-in-2016-1-3956814|title=Runrig to stage Edinburgh Castle gig in 2016|author=|date=|website=scotsman.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''The Last Dance'' and disbandment (2017\u20132018)===\n[[File:Runrig, farewell at Stirling, 18-08-2018.jpg|thumb|right|Runrig on stage during ''The Last Dance'' in Stirling]] \nOn 26 September 2017 Runrig announced that after 45 years they would be \"pulling the curtain down\" on their music careers. The band announced one final tour named The Final Mile, taking part in Germany, Denmark and UK, ending with one final show in [[Stirling]]'s City Park called ''The Last Dance''. Tickets for The Last Dance sold out in minutes and, after a few days of behind the scenes planning, Runrig announced another concert in the same location the night before. Tickets for this night sold out in less than six hours. It was a very emotional farewell, and the uncertain Scottish weather held out for their final rendition of \"Loch Lomond.\"\n\n== Historical references ==\nMany of the band's songs include references to Scottish history or culture.

From its inception, the band's line-up included songwriters [[Rory Macdonald (musician)|Rory Macdonald]] and [[Calum MacDonald (musician)|Calum Macdonald]]. The line-up during most of the 1980s and 1990s (the band's most successful period) also included [[Donnie Munro]], Malcolm Jones, Iain Bayne, and [[Pete Wishart]]. Munro left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics and was replaced by [[Bruce Guthro]]. Wishart left in 2001 and was replaced by Brian Hurren. The band released fourteen [[studio album]]s, with a number of their songs sung in [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nInitially formed as a three-piece dance band known as 'The Run Rig Dance Band', the band played several low key events, and has previously cited a [[ceilidh]] at Kelvin Hall, [[Glasgow]] as their first concert.<ref>{{cite web|title=#tbt 43 years ago today we played our first \"concert\", a ceilidh in the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow! Time flies.|url=https://twitter.com/runrig1973/status/725692295245357056|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> Runrig's music is often described as a blend of [[folk music|folk]] and [[rock music|rock]] music, with the band's lyrics often focusing upon locations, history, politics, and people that are unique to Scotland. Songs also make references to [[agriculture]], land conservation and religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/3687-runrig|title=Runrig - Artist Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nSince 1999, the band has gained attention in [[Canada]], following [[Nova Scotia]]n singer Bruce Guthro's entry to the band. In 2016, the band announced that it would retire from studio recording after the release of its 14th studio album, ''[[The Story (Runrig album)|The Story]]''<ref>{{cite web|last1=RICK FULTON|title=Runrig release their final album but insist it's not the end of The Story|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/runrig-release-final-album-insist-7267508|website=Daily Record|accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref> and announced their final tour ''The Last Mile'' in 2017. On 17 and 18 August 2018, Runrig performed the final shows of their farewell tour, entitled ''The Last Dance'', in [[Stirling]] City Park beneath the castle ramparts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Runrig - The Last Dance|url=http://www.runrig.co.uk/blog/2017/9/25/runrig-the-last-dance|accessdate=2018-09-02}}</ref> An estimated 52,000 fans attended ''The Last Dance''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Last Dance: thousands say farewell to Runrig|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/16584918.the-last-dance-thousands-say-farewell-to-runrig/|accessdate=2018-09-02}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation and early years (1973\u20131987) ===\nThe band was formed in 1973 with brothers Calum and Rory Macdonald and their friend Blair Douglas.\n[[Donnie Munro]] joined the following year and they started to expand outside their native Isle of [[Skye]]. Douglas left the band in late 1974 and was replaced by Robert Macdonald. This line-up continued until 1978, when Douglas re-joined and [[Malcolm Jones (musician)|Malcolm Jones]] became [[guitarist]], both displacing Robert Macdonald.\n\nIn the same year, Runrig's first album, entitled ''[[Play Gaelic]]'', was released. All the songs were in Gaelic. It was re-released in 1990 as ''Play Gaelic, the first legendary recording''.\n\nIn 1979, Blair Douglas left Runrig again to pursue a solo career. 1979 also saw the release of Runrig's second album, ''[[The Highland Connection]]'' on the band's own label, Ridge Records. A somewhat transitional album, it features wailing [[electric guitar]]s and  [[ballad]]s. The album also included the original version of \"[[Loch Lomond#The song|Loch Lomond]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/music/features/thetradtop100.shtml |title=In final BBC shortlist for top traditional Scottish song |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> A later version was to become their signature song and closing song at concerts.\n\nThe third Runrig album, ''[[Recovery (1981 album)|Recovery]]'' (released in 1981), was a [[concept album|thematic record]] dealing with the rise and politics of Scotland's Gaelic community. 1980 saw the arrival of [[drummer]] Iain Bayne (from Scottish folk/rock band [[New Celeste]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/play/b0bgbvkr|title=BBC Radio Scotland - 22/08/2018|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and [[synthesizer|keyboard]] player Richard Cherns.\n\nIn 1982, Runrig re-recorded \"Loch Lomond\" as their first single. They signed to a small label called Simple Records in 1984, and two singles were released. The first was \"Dance Called America\". A longer version of the second single \"Skye\" appeared on the Alba Records [[compilation album|compilation]] ''A Feast Of Scottish Folk Music, Volume One'' along with an early version of \"Lifeline\", both of which were previously unreleased on albums, and \"Na h-Uain a's t-Earrach\" which was the [[B-side]] to \"Dance Called America\".\n\nThe band then engaged the services of producer [[Chris Rainbow|Chris Harley]] who brought to their recordings the benefit of his experience as a solo artist and a singer with The Alan Parsons Project and Camel.  Runrig's fourth independent studio album, ''[[Heartland (Runrig album)|''Heartland'']]'' (released in 1985), combined Gaelic sounds with anthemic rock music.\n\nRichard Cherns left the band in February 1986 and was replaced by ex-[[Big Country]] member [[Pete Wishart]].\n\n=== Major label and mainstream success (1987\u20131997) ===\n\nThe period from 1987\u20131997 marked Runrig's most successful run, during which they achieved placings in both the UK albums and singles charts, and toured extensively.\n\nWith (for the first time) major-label support (from [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]]), Runrig's fifth studio album, ''The Cutter And The Clan'' (1987), which had originally been released on the independent Ridge Records label before being re-released on Chrysalis, brought the band wider audiences in the United Kingdom, as well as in other parts of Europe.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1995, Runrig released a total of five studio albums through Chrysalis Records. Along with ''The Cutter And The Clan'', the other four albums were: ''Searchlight'' (1989), ''The Big Wheel'' (1991), ''Amazing Things'' (1993), and ''Mara'' (1995).\n\nOn 22 June 1991, the band attracted around 50,000 people to an outdoor concert held in [[Balloch Country Park]], near Loch Lomond. This was the largest number of people to attend a Runrig concert.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Mara'', lead singer Donnie Munro grew more involved in politics. In 1997, he left Runrig in order to stand for a seat in the House of Commons for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. However, he was not elected.\n\nRunrig began searching for a new frontman, and in 1998 they announced their selection of Bruce Guthro, a [[singer-songwriter]] from [[Nova Scotia]].\n\n=== Transitional challenges (1997 to 2001) ===\nRunrig's tenth album, ''[[In Search Of Angels]]'' (1999), was released amidst some uncertainty about the band's future.\n\nSince their contract with Chrysalis had ended, Runrig chose to release ''In Search Of Angels'' on their own label, Ridge Records. As a result, the record received much less promotion than the previous five, and sales were considerably smaller. Runrig was also faced with the challenge of acclimatising their fans to a new [[lead vocalist]]. The band toured extensively in support of the record, and in 2000, they also released a live album called ''[[Live at Celtic Connections 2000|Live At Celtic Connections 2000]]'', allowing fans to hear older Runrig songs sung by their new frontman.\n\nThe year 2000 concluded with the release of an authorised songbook, ''Flower Of The West - The Runrig Songbook''. The book included lyrics, sheet music, photographs, and background information for 115 of Runrig's songs - nearly every album track and single from the band's first ten studio albums.\n\n===Renewed popularity (2001\u20132009)===\nHaving established that they could continue without Donnie Munro, Runrig set to work on their eleventh studio album.\n\nAmong their independently-released studio albums, ''[[The Stamping Ground]]'' (2001) was Runrig's most successful.  Moreover, critics who had given mixed reviews to ''In Search Of Angels'', praised ''The Stamping Ground'' as the quintessential Runrig album. The band continued to enjoy support in the UK, Germany, and Denmark. However, with a Canadian frontman, Runrig began finding new fans in Canada and the United States.\n\nIn [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], [[Pete Wishart]], the band's keyboard player, left after being elected [[Member of Parliament]] for the constituency of [[Tayside North (UK Parliament constituency)|Tayside North]] for the [[Scottish National Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/key_people/newsid_1179000/1179393.stm |title=Pete Wishart: SNP |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-03-22 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2174505.stm |title=BBC profile of Peter Wishart |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-10-16 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/2041027.stm |title=Rock MP takes on music pirates |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-06-12 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]] he was again elected, this time for the new constituency of [[Perth and North Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and North Perthshire]] and again for the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/05/11/mp4_music_feature.shtml |title=MP4 strike a chord with voters |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-05-13 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> Brian Hurren stepped in to take Wishart's place in the band.  {{As of|March 2019|post=,}} Wishart has been re-elected in each subsequent general election, albeit with a [[marginal seat|very slim majority]] in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].\n\nThe 2001 album ''[[The Stamping Ground]]'' was seen very much as a return to form after the lacklustre ''[[In Search Of Angels]]'' (1999), but 2003's ''[[Proterra (album)|Proterra]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/folk/reviews/proterra.shtml |title=BBC review of Proterra |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/entertainment/louder/love/runrig/ |title=Runrig at the Sands Centre |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> divided opinion.\n\nIn August 2003, Runrig played their 30th Anniversary concert on the esplanade at Stirling Castle, celebrating 30 years since the band's formation, and including visitors from previous line-ups, as well as guest artists including the Glasgow Islay Choir and Paul Mounsey.\n\nRunrig played their first U.S. concert, a benefit for the charity \"Glasgow the Caring City\", on 4 April 2006 at the Nokia Theatre in New York City.  Founding member Blair Douglas joined the band onstage, playing accordion on several numbers.  In the audience were fans from as far away as [[Texas]], [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Colorado]], [[Minnesota]], Norwich (England) and Scotland.\n\nWhile the bulk of their 2007 tour was scheduled for Denmark, Germany, and England, an outdoor show, titled \"Beat The Drum\", was held at [[Loch Ness]] on 18 August 2007. It was staged at Borlum Farm, [[Drumnadrochit]] and attended by 18,500 people in heavy rain. Because of the unusually large number of support acts, it had been likened to an all-day music festival, Runrig being the headline act.<ref>{{cite news|author=Raymond Buchanan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6954703.stm |title=Fans beat the mud to see heroes |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> This was the first in what was to become a staple for Runrig - annually staging big outdoor shows in Scotland in summer.\n\nRunrig re-recorded \"[[The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond|Loch Lomond]] (Hampden Remix)\" to raise funds for the BBC's annual [[Children In Need]] appeal.

They were supported by acts such as the [[Peatbog Faeries]], piper Fred Morrison, [[King Creosote]], Kathleen Macinnes, and Blair Douglas (a former member of the group) and his band. Attendance numbered ~15,000.<br/>The show was part of Scotland's Year of Homecoming 2009. In order to underline this, [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] made an appearance on stage (introduced by his [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] colleague and former band member [[Pete Wishart]]), and launched an initiative called 'SconeStone.' This aims to promote [[Scotland]] as a kind and compassionate nation through the \"journey of kindness\" made by the SconeStone across the world. Its keepers, each holding it for a week before passing it on, are expected to undertake a good deed. Its first keeper was the Reverend Neil Galbraith, who was presented with the stone on the same day.\n\n=== Health concerns (2009\u20132010) ===\nIn March 2009, guitarist Malcolm Jones suffered a [[heart attack]] in [[Edinburgh]] whilst running to catch a train.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7934676.stm |title=UK &#124; Scotland &#124; Edinburgh, East and Fife &#124; Runrig guitarist Jones collapses |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> This forced the band to cancel a sizable tour of Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Germany. After undergoing minor surgery, he took to the stage with Runrig again in May of the same year. During a routine check up with his doctors in June 2009, he was strongly advised to have [[heart bypass]] surgery, which forced the band to cancel a tour of Denmark.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8107396.stm |title=Scotland &#124; Edinburgh, East and Fife &#124; Heart bypass for Runrig guitarist |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> The operation was a success and, although the band was forced to cancel their show at the 35th [[T\u00f8nder Festival]] in [[T\u00f8nder]], Denmark, Malcolm returned to the stage in late August 2009, at the band's big outdoor Scottish [[Homecoming Scotland 2009|Homecoming]] show for 2009 at [[Scone Palace]], [[Perthshire]], Scotland. However, on 28 February 2010, just a week prior to an extensive German tour, it was announced that Malcolm would have to have yet another operation which in turn forced the band to cancel/postpone their Spring dates in [[Germany]], due to start on 3 March 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/8542891.stm |title=Implant operation for Runrig guitarist Malcolm Jones |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> In a statement released by the band on their official website they noted that Malcolm's health was \"good\" and that the problem was \"purely a technical one\". They also emphatically stated that \"All other concerts planned for 2010 will go ahead.\"\nIt was announced that the winter tour scheduled for winter 2010 would be the last tour for a year with the band planning no concerts in 2011 so that they can focus on other projects. The final date for 2010 was in the [[Barrowland Ballroom]], [[Glasgow]] which is traditionally where the band finishes their Scottish tours. In a statement released by the office, they promised it to be \"quite a party\".\n\nOn 1 November 2010, the band released a four-disc compilation, entitled ''[[50 Great Songs]]''. The release includes both studio and live performances, focusing primarily upon Bruce Guthro's time within the band.\n\n=== Year off and ''Rewired'' (2011\u20132012) ===\nAfter the end of the 2010 tour the band collectively made the decision to take a year off. \nCalum and Rory had been concentrating on a long gestating project outside of Runrig. The duo call themselves [[The Band from Rockall]] and released their debut album outside of Runrig at the end of April 2012.\nKeyboardist Brian Hurren also released his debut solo album, which he wrote, performed and produced himself, under the name ''A Hundred Thousand Welcomes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahtw.co.uk/ |title=ahtw.co.uk |publisher=ahtw.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> the inspiration for the name coming from Bruce Guthro shouting the Gaelic equivalent of the phrase during \"Beat the Drum\" at Loch Ness. \nGuthro released another solo album, while drummer Iain Bayne was appointed manager of English [[folk-rock]] band [[Coast (folk rock band)|Coast]]. \nThe band re-united as a six-piece again in the summer of 2012 for the Rewired Tour, with the big Scottish outdoor show held in August at the Northern Meeting Park in [[Inverness]].\n\n=== 40th anniversary (2013\u20132014) ===\nIn November 2012, ahead of their planned Rewired Tour, the band announced a special 40th Anniversary Concert at the Black Isle Show Ground in [[Muir of Ord]], near [[Inverness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safeconcerts.com/festivals/runrig-party-on-the-moor-the-40th-anniversary-weekend/ |title=Runrig \u2018Party On The Moor\u2019 the 40th anniversary weekend 2013|publisher=Safeconcerts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> The 40th Anniversary show was a weekend of live entertainment featuring 'special guests', entitled \"Party On The Moor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-23620167 |title=BBC News - Runrig holds 40th anniversary bash |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> Shortly after that they announced another \"special\" concert at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in July, entitled \"Celebration In The City\". On 28 April 2013 (to mark Runrig's first ever concert 40 years earlier) Runrig released their first single in 5 years entitled \"And We'll Sing\".  \nAt Party On The Moor former members [[Donnie Munro]] and [[Pete Wishart]] performed onstage alongside the current lineup and Blair Douglas made an appearance via a short video highlighting the changes in the band's lineup since 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/Whats-On/Music/Review-Old-friends-help-Runrig-party-on-the-Moor-12082013.htm |title=Review: Old friends help Runrig party on the Moor &#124; Inverness Courier &#124; Whats-On &#124; Music |publisher=Inverness Courier |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref> This was the first time Munro had performed with Runrig since 1997, and for many it was a powerful statement seeing [[Bruce Guthro|Guthro]] and Munro singing together as there had been heated debates about who should be the band's frontman, and who was the better frontman among many fans and critics. The gig was hailed as a success by fans and critics many calling it one of the best concerts Runrig have ever staged. Bassist, Rory Macdonald said that \"in many ways, it was the perfect Runrig gig\" whilst drummer, Iain Bayne called it \"the culmination of a lifetime's work\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=133938706776593 |title=Runrig - Party On The Moor |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2013 it was announced that Runrig would embark on a Spring 2014 tour of England to continue the 40th Anniversary celebrations. Entitled \"Party on the Tour\" it would \"draw inspiration\" from the Party on the Moor show. Alongside the English dates, several European [[music festivals]] were announced for 2014. In December 2013 it was officially confirmed that Party on the Moor would be released on DVD. In January further details for the DVD were released. On 31 March 2014 Runrig released the full, uncut concert on both DVD, CD and, for the first time ever for Runrig, [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runrig.co.uk/?p=256 |title=Party on the Moor \u2013 Live DVD &#124; Runrig &#124; 40th Anniversary |publisher=Runrig |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref>\n\n===''The Story'' (2014\u20132017)===\nThe band announced in issue 74 of The Wire magazine and on their [https://www.twitter.com/Runrig1973 official Twitter feed] that they had begun work on their 14th studio album. It was also announced (informally) that to accommodate for the time it takes to write, record and produce an album they would not be playing any further live shows in 2014 after the [[T\u00f8nder Festival]], due to be held on 28 and 29 August 2014. In the summer 2015 issue of The Wire it was revealed that the album would be called ''[[The Story (Runrig album)|The Story]]'', and would be released in spring 2016.\nOn 12 November 2015 the title track, and lead single, received its first radio play on [[BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal]]. During an interview with the show's host Derek Murray, Calum Macdonald said that the upcoming album would likely be the last studio album that the band would release, also confirming the album's release date as the 29th of January 2016.

The band announced one final tour named The Final Mile, taking part in Germany, Denmark and UK, ending with one final show in [[Stirling]]'s City Park called ''The Last Dance''. Tickets for The Last Dance sold out in minutes and, after a few days of behind the scenes planning, Runrig announced another concert in the same location the night before. Tickets for this night sold out in less than six hours. It was a very emotional farewell, and the uncertain Scottish weather held out for their final rendition of \"Loch Lomond.\"\n\n== Historical references ==\nMany of the band's songs include references to Scottish history or culture.
