The film is told from Allyson's ([[Aly Michalka]]) point of view, similar to a documentary and tells the story of what can happen when a reality TV show uncovers something that is not meant to be seen on television.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=September 2018}}\nAspiring teen producer Allyson Miller ([[Alyson Michalka]]) signs up to produce a new reality show, searching for the world's greatest kid magician. Desperate to find her star, Allyson (along with adult mentor Paul, and kid cameraman Cedric) stumbles upon Danny Sinclair ([[Johnny Pacar]]), who gets them on the show. When Danny is selected as one of three finalists, he appears to have something more than the others. Even show host and master magician Max ([[Frank Langella]]) takes a special interest in Danny's talent. \n\nWhen Danny confesses to Allyson that his powers are real, she is shocked but promises to believe him. She feels they have something in common since they have both never had friends. Unfortunately, after an interrogation by Max and a panel of experts, Danny is apparently proven to be a fake. Betrayed, Allyson refuses to talk to Danny. However, when she views the first video of him, she sees doves appear from nowhere and begins to believe in him again. When she goes to look for him, she hears voices through a door and eavesdrops on the conversation.\n\nShe finds that Max is confessing to Danny that he, too, is a real magician \u2014 a sorcerer. After Max demonstrates his talents, he promises to help Danny control his powers and gives him a ring. He tells Danny that whenever he wears the ring, Danny will be fully in control of his own powers. Danny puts it on and leaves the room. Paul enters, and Max reveals his plan: to control Danny's powers through the ring, and whenever Danny wears it, he will slowly lose his powers.\n\nAllyson rushes to try to find Danny, but he already trusts Max too much. When Allyson tries to show the tape to the show's producer, Max uses his powers to erase it. The producer asks her to leave, believing she has cracked under the pressure. Allyson leaves, upset because Danny did not stand up for her. On the train home, she remembers the famous magician Antonio DeMilo, whom Max called his 'mentor.' When she researches this, she discovers that DeMilo died when a prop collapsed on him. He was wearing the ring Danny is wearing now, and Allyson realizes Danny is in grave danger.\n\nAllyson manages to re-enter the grand finale of the show inside a magic 'box'. She warns Danny again, telling him that he can't remove the ring alone, he needs someone to remove it for him. Danny goes on-stage, where Max tries to make a 1000&nbsp;lb weight collapse on him, but Allyson's warning helps him escape. Danny and Max are then locked in combat; the audience thinks it is all part of the show. After a fight, Allyson is able to remove the ring from Danny, who then places it onto Max - he disappears. Allyson and Danny bow, and Danny kisses Allyson's hand.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Allyson speaks into the camera to clarify the events that followed. She believes Paul removed Max's ring after the show, because the tapes soon disappeared. She then reappeared in her room.

The film is told from Allyson's ([[Aly Michalka]]) point of view, similar to a documentary and tells the story of what can happen when a reality TV show uncovers something that is not meant to be seen on television. \n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=September 2018}}\nAspiring teen producer Allyson Miller ([[Alyson Michalka]]) signs up to produce a new reality show, searching for the world's greatest kid magician. Desperate to find her star, Allyson (along with adult mentor Paul, and kid cameraman Cedric) stumbles upon Danny Sinclair ([[Johnny Pacar]]), who gets them on the show. When Danny is selected as one of three finalists, he appears to have something more than the others. Even show host and master magician Max ([[Frank Langella]]) takes a special interest in Danny's talent. \n\nWhen Danny confesses to Allyson that his powers are real, she is shocked but promises to believe him. She feels they have something in common since they have both never had friends. Unfortunately, after an interrogation by Max and a panel of experts, Danny is apparently proven to be a fake. Betrayed, Allyson refuses to talk to Danny. However, when she views the first video of him, she sees doves appear from nowhere and begins to believe in him again. When she goes to look for him, she hears voices through a door and eavesdrops on the conversation.\n\nShe finds that Max is confessing to Danny that he, too, is a real magician \u2014 a sorcerer. After Max demonstrates his talents, he promises to help Danny control his powers and gives him a ring. He tells Danny that whenever he wears the ring, Danny will be fully in control of his own powers. Danny puts it on and leaves the room. Paul enters, and Max reveals his plan: to control Danny's powers through the ring, and whenever Danny wears it, he will slowly lose his powers.\n\nAllyson rushes to try to find Danny, but he already trusts Max too much. When Allyson tries to show the tape to the show's producer, Max uses his powers to erase it. The producer asks her to leave, believing she has cracked under the pressure. Allyson leaves, upset because Danny did not stand up for her. On the train home, she remembers the famous magician Antonio DeMilo, whom Max called his 'mentor.' When she researches this, she discovers that DeMilo died when a prop collapsed on him. He was wearing the ring Danny is wearing now, and Allyson realizes Danny is in grave danger.\n\nAllyson manages to re-enter the grand finale of the show inside a magic 'box'. She warns Danny again, telling him that he can't remove the ring alone, he needs someone to remove it for him. Danny goes on-stage, where Max tries to make a 1000&nbsp;lb weight collapse on him, but Allyson's warning helps him escape. Danny and Max are then locked in combat; the audience thinks it is all part of the show. After a fight, Allyson is able to remove the ring from Danny, who then places it onto Max - he disappears. Allyson and Danny bow, and Danny kisses Allyson's hand.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Allyson speaks into the camera to clarify the events that followed. She believes Paul removed Max's ring after the show, because the tapes soon disappeared. She then reappeared in her room. She says Danny has gone into hiding to learn more about his powers, and prepare for a future showdown with Max, and she doesn't know where he is. Then a popcorn bowl levitates from behind her and comes to her arms. She laughs and says that she does know. She is then teleported next to Danny, who seems in much better control of his powers.

She is racist and had an issue in March 2020 with the fandom from BTS. Telling lies that the fandom was racist just because she got called out saying the n-word and doing the blackface on instagram. Her excuse was that it was a \"potatoe face\" even tho the filter was the \"Doll me Up\" Filter. The thing is it isn't the first time she is doing it. She got mad and started to bring BTS past and started to insult them. Not how she started to insult the fandom. She is manipulative and she played the victim and faked some chats to prove her point. That's pathetic. This woman is sick. On reddit are all evidence what she did before.

[[Zorlu Holding]] acquired the bank from the [[Privatization Board of Turkey]] for $70 million, and holding chairman Ahmet Zorlu invited Garanti Bank Moscow's CEO to be the new bank's founding CEO.\n\nOperations commenced in a [[Swiss\u00f4tel The Bosphorus|hotel]] room in August that year, and the bank moved into its new headquarters in [[Karak\u00f6y]] the following month.

European financial services institution [[Dexia]] was the owner prior to this.\n\n== History ==\n\nDenizBank was established in 1938 as a state-owned bank (Denizcilik Bankas\u0131) to help finance the then emerging Turkish [[Maritime transport|maritime]] industry. In 1992, the Turkish government decided to consolidate a number of state-owned banks, and DenizBank merged into [[Emlak Kredi Bank|Emlakbank]].\n\nIn 1997, a banking license was auctioned by the government under the name of DenizBank without any significant assets except for three branch buildings. [[Zorlu Holding]] acquired the bank from the [[Privatization Board of Turkey]] for $70 million, and holding chairman Ahmet Zorlu invited Garanti Bank Moscow's CEO to be the new bank's founding CEO.\n\nOperations commenced in a [[Swiss\u00f4tel The Bosphorus|hotel]] room in August that year, and the bank moved into its new headquarters in [[Karak\u00f6y]] the following month. Its first 13 branches (5 outside Istanbul) were also opened.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/ekonomi/denizbankin-20-yillik-turkiye-yolculugu-1958731/|title=DenizBank\u2019\u0131n 20 y\u0131ll\u0131k T\u00fcrkiye yolculu\u011fu|last=|first=|date=2017-08-03|work=S\u00f6zc\u00fc|access-date=2018-04-27|language=tr}}</ref> With a revitalization program initiated, branches were opened under a new corporate identity. Expansion was supported by the acquisition of branch offices from other banks, including [[Tari\u015fbank]] in 2002.

The remaining 25% of the shares were held publicly. It remained the primary shareholder until 2012, when [[Sberbank]] agreed to buy DenizBank for US$3.6 billion from the financially troubled Dexia.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-07/sberbank-said-to-buy-dexia-unit-denizbank-for-3-6-billion-1-.html Sberbank Said To Buy Dexia Unit Denizbank For $3.6 Billion].

Early elections in Republika Srpska were held in 1997, after which Plav\u0161i\u0107 and her SNS closely cooperated with the smaller Serbian socialist parties ([[Socialist Party of Republika Srpska|Socialist Party]] and Dodik's SNSD).

She described him as \"a breath of fresh air\" and pledged \u20ac3.6 million of immediate aid. Republika Srpska also received aid from the British government in the same month.

Early elections in Republika Srpska were held in 1997, after which Plav\u0161i\u0107 and her SNS closely cooperated with the smaller Serbian socialist parties ([[Socialist Party of Republika Srpska|Socialist Party]] and Dodik's SNSD).

She described him as \"a breath of fresh air\" and pledged \u20ac3.6 million of immediate aid. Republika Srpska also received aid from the British government in the same month.

Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier e-mailed three of his superior officers and seven other Navy Captains, outlining a plan for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'' was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam.

Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days Crozier e-mailed three of his superior officers and seven other Navy Captains, outlining a plan for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'' was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam.
