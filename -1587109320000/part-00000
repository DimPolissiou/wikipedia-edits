He was a first cousin six times removed of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and a nephew of [[J. A. Folger]], the founder of [[Folgers|Folger Coffee]]. He is descendant of [[Peter Foulger]] and [[Mary Morrill|Mary ''Morrill'' Foulger]].\n\nHe prepared at [[Adelphi Academy]], [[Brooklyn]], New York, where he was acquainted with [[Charles Pratt]], the businessman and president of the Adelphi board of trustees who became a mentor to Folger. At Adelphi, Folger was schooled in art, chemistry, classics, and recitation, and was elected president of the school's literary association. He then attended [[Amherst College]] with [[Charles Millard Pratt]], a close friend who was the son of Folger's mentor from the Adelphi Academy. To fund his education, Folger participated in many oratorical essay contests; he won prizes for competitions in 1876 and 1879, the latter of which paid for his junior year of school. Folger modeled his rhetorical style on [[Daniel Webster]]'s. He identified a Shakespeare-related essay contest as the origin of his obsession with the Bard. Emily, however, later attributed the origin of Folger's fascination with Shakespeare to an 1879 lecture by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], whose elegant and eloquent delivery sounded Shakespearean to the college student. Folger was a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity, graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1879.  After Amherst, he attended [[Columbia Law School]] from 1879 to 1881, and was admitted to the bar in 1881.<ref name=\"Grant2014\">{{cite book|author=Stephen H.

Rockefeller]], getting his start in the oil business as a clerk at Charles Pratt & Company, a refinery owned by [[Charles Pratt]], the father of his Adelphi and Amherst classmate [[Charles Millard Pratt]]. The Pratt Company was already associated with Standard Oil at that time.<ref>Lynch, Kathleen, \"Folger, Henry Clay,\" ''American National Biography,'' [[John Garatty]] and Mark Carnes (eds.) New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Volume 8, pp. 169\u2013170.</ref> Folger quickly showed his prowess as a mathematician and statistician; his management of data on oil processing led to a promotion in 1886, when he became the secretary of Standard Oil's manufacturing committee. In 1890, Folger wrote ''Petroleum: Its Production and Products in Pennsylvania'', an article for [[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]] about the oil business.\n\nFolger's assets increased in 1899, when he was promoted to chairman of the manufacturing committee, the same year that Standard Oil of New Jersey became the central holding company for the Standard Oil Trust, which dissolved after the passage of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. The stock Folger held in Standard Oil of New Jersey would contribute significantly to Folger's ability to collect Shakespeareana. In 1908, he was elected assistant treasurer of Jersey Standard, and joined its board of sixteen directors, managing the company's finances and compiling production data. That year, Folger was also elected to Jersey Standard's executive committee.\n\nThe 1911 [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|Supreme Court decision]] to break up the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey monopoly resulted in the election of Folger as president of the second-largest company formed from the dissolved Jersey Standard, the [[Mobil|Standard Oil Company of New York]], or Socony. Folger also owned significant amounts of stock in the [[Magnolia Petroleum Company]], a Texan company that became a fully owned subsidiary of Socony in 1925. He retired as president in 1923, but stayed at Socony as the first chairman of its board of trustees until 1928, when he officially retired to devote all of his attention to plans for his Shakespeare Library. Folger was succeeded as president by [[Herbert L. Pratt]], another son of Charles Pratt.\n\nIn 1956, the Folger Shakespeare Library received Folger's walnut desk from Socony Mobil Oil. Since that year, it has been used by the Library's director.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Marriage to Emily Clara Jordan==\nHenry Clay Folger met Emily Clara Jordan in the early 1880s at a meeting of the Irving Literary Circle in Brooklyn. Both were close, respectively, with the Pratt siblings Charles and Lillie. Early in their relationship, Henry and Emily connected via Shakespeare. At an 1882 picnic held by the Irving Literary Circle, Charles and Lillie prompted the two to each give a toast; Emily drew from ''[[Othello]]''. while Henry quoted from ''[[As You Like It]]''. She was born in 1858 and was educated at [[Vassar College]]. They married on October 6, 1885 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], where Emily had spent her teenage years. The Folgers had no children. They lived in rented houses in Brooklyn throughout most of their lives, moving to [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in 1895 and to 24 Brevoot Place in 1910, but later purchased an estate in Glen Cove, Long Island in 1929.<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\nThe Folgers took annual vacations to [[The Omni Homestead Resort|The Homestead]] resort in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], where Henry enjoyed participating in golf tournaments in his later years. Though the Folgers had no children, they considered their collection to be their descendants, and Henry was known to refer to his rare books as \"the boys.\"<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Shakespeare Collecting==\nFolger was an avid collector of Shakespeareana, assembling the world's largest collection of [[First Folio]] editions of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\">[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 The Library in the New Age, an article by Robert Darnton]</ref> The first rare book Folger acquired was a 1685 copy of the [[Early texts of Shakespeare's works#Folios|Fourth Folio]], purchased in 1889 for $107.50. He purchased his first original copy of the First Folio four years later, in 1893. Unlike other wealthy collectors of the period, like [[Henry E. Huntington]] and [[J.P. Morgan]], Folger favored \"imperfect\" copies of rare volumes, with their [[marginalia]] and other markings. Following this trend, his Folio collection was marked with diversity in provenance and condition. He preferred to purchase Early Editions of books published between 1567 and 1606, in addition to manuscripts of the period. Based on their collective knowledge of Latin and French, and Emily's proficiency in German, the couple also favored rare volumes published on the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The couple was less interested in art collection, and many of the Shakespeare-related paintings they purchased were misattributed to artists like [[Thomas Gainsborough]].\n\nThe Folgers chose items to purchase from booksellers' catalogues, which were initially perused and marked up by Emily, before she passed them on to Henry, who kept an extensive and precise list of items he intended to bid on. If possible, he inspected an item personally before purchasing it. He also avoided consulting scholarly experts about rare volumes, preferring his own and Emily's expertise, as she received an M.A. from [[Vassar College]] in 1896 for a thesis on Shakespeare. Folger used professional booksellers as middlemen at auctions, believing that the concealment of his identity would keep prices low. Due to the growing size of the collection and their concern for fireproofing, eventually few of the Folgers' acquisitions were stored in their living space. They kept an extensive card catalog at home in Brooklyn, and when traveling, took a smaller, annotated set of check lists along with them. The collection itself was stored among several fireproof warehouse companies throughout Manhattan, in specially-designed wooden cases originally meant to hold two five-gallon cans of oil each. Frederick Fales, a co-worker of Folger's at Standard Oil, initially designed and ordered these air-tight wooden cases for company use.<ref>Grant, pp. 111-118.</ref> Some of the most valuable items were kept in bank vaults, or in a safe in Folger's office.\n\nFolger financed a half-century of collecting with his Standard Oil salary and extensive investments in the company. His high placement at Standard Oil also allowed him to take out loans with his friend Charles Millard Pratt, [[John D. Rockefeller]], and even his wife, to fund his purchases. He generally paid for items in cash, a strategy that earned him the favor of many booksellers who needed immediate funds. Folger also preferred to purchase whole collections, like the [[James Halliwell-Phillipps|Halliwell-Phillipps]] collection, acquired in 1908, because bulk purchases drove down prices of individual items.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\nIn 1909, Folger established a Shakespeare Prize at Amherst; winning students won a cash prize, and their essays joined Folger's collection and currently reside in the Folger Shakespeare Library. Folger also made donations to Amherst College's library, contributing many duplicate volumes purchased at auction to the College. The most valuable of these donations were two leaves from a [[Gutenberg Bible]].<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Folger Shakespeare Library==\n{{main|Folger Shakespeare Library}}\nEarly in his career at Standard Oil and as a collector, Folger doubted that he would eventually have the funds to build a memorial or library for his growing collection, and in 1895 he offered to sell it to John D. Rockefeller, who refused. Before he acquired the funds for what was to become the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], Folger also debated selling the collection to a university.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\nToward the end of [[World War I]], Folger and his wife began searching for a location for his Shakespeare library. Among the sites he and Emily considered were Amherst and Nantucket, Massachusetts, the University of Chicago, New York City, and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], before they settled on a Washington, D.C. site they discovered in 1918 during a layover in the city while traveling to Hot Springs. Folger spent nine years purchasing the fourteen row houses that occupied the block of East Capitol Street between First and Second Streets, which he would demolish to build his Library; thus, they did not make their choice of a site on Capitol Hill public until 1928. Soon afterwards, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a resolution allowing use of the land on East Capitol Street where the Folger Shakespeare Library now stands.\n\nAfter the passage of this legislation, Folger hired [[Paul Philippe Cret]] as the Library's architect, suggested by Alexander Trowbridge, an architect who had married into the Pratt family and stayed on the project as consulting architect. Folger played an integral part in the design and execution of the Library's classical exterior and Tudor interior. The inclusion of an Elizabethan theater within the Library's main building was also Folger's idea, though he intended it as a venue for academic lectures rather than performances. Folger hired sculptor John Gregory to design the relief sculptures that appear on the building's facade. The [[cornerstone]] of the library was laid in 1930, but Henry Folger died soon afterward.  The bulk of his fortune was left in [[Charitable trust|trust]] for the library, with [[Amherst College]] as trust administrator. With additional funding from Emily Folger, the library opened in 1932 on April 23, the date traditionally believed to be Shakespeare's birthday. Folger's collection of Shakespearean works is considered one of the most important resources for scholars of the playwright.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\"/>\n\n==Other interests and activities==\n[[File:Central Cong'l Church, Brooklyn, by L. G. Strand.jpg|thumb|Central Congregational Church]]\nFolger was a trustee of the Hamilton Trust Company, Brooklyn, New York, and a director of Seaboard National Bank in New York.  In 1914 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from [[Amherst College|Amherst]]. Outside of work, his great interests were his Shakespeare collection and, in later life, golf, which he often played with Rockefeller.<ref name=\"Lynch, page 170\">Lynch, page 170.</ref> He was a trustee of the Central Congregational Church in Brooklyn<ref name=\"Lynch, page 170\"/> and established the [[Shakespeare Garden]] at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]].<ref>[http://www.bbg.org/exp/stroll/shakespeare.html Brooklyn Botanic Garden: Shakespeare Garden<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn a 1933 lecture delivered after his death, Emily identified ''[[King Lear]]'' as his favorite of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Death==\nIn May 1930, Henry Folger was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn for surgery on an enlarged prostate. While recovering, he continued to work on the construction and development of his Shakespeare Library from his sickbed. He later had a second prostate operation prior to his death on June 11, 1930. His funeral was held at Brooklyn's Central Congregational Church, where he had been an active member.<ref>Grant, page 163.</ref> Reverend Samuel Parkes Cadman, who, along with his wife, had been close with the Folgers, gave Henry's eulogy.<ref>Mays, Andrea. ''The Millionaire and the Bard''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2015, page 256.</ref> Henry's ashes were interred beneath the Folgers' copy of [[Shakespeare's funerary monument]] in what is now the Folger Shakespeare Library's Old Reading Room.

In 1890, Folger wrote ''Petroleum: Its Production and Products in Pennsylvania'', an article for [[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]] about the oil business.\n\nFolger's assets increased in 1899, when he was promoted to chairman of the manufacturing committee, the same year that Standard Oil of New Jersey became the central holding company for the Standard Oil Trust, which dissolved after the passage of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. The stock Folger held in Standard Oil of New Jersey would contribute significantly to Folger's ability to collect Shakespeareana. In 1908, he was elected assistant treasurer of Jersey Standard, and joined its board of sixteen directors, managing the company's finances and compiling production data. That year, Folger was also elected to Jersey Standard's executive committee.\n\nThe 1911 [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|Supreme Court decision]] to break up the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey monopoly resulted in the election of Folger as president of the second-largest company formed from the dissolved Jersey Standard, the [[Mobil|Standard Oil Company of New York]], or Socony. Folger also owned significant amounts of stock in the [[Magnolia Petroleum Company]], a Texan company that became a fully owned subsidiary of Socony in 1925. He retired as president in 1923, but stayed at Socony as the first chairman of its board of trustees until 1928, when he officially retired to devote all of his attention to plans for his Shakespeare Library. Folger was succeeded as president by [[Herbert L. Pratt]], another son of Charles Pratt.\n\nIn 1956, the Folger Shakespeare Library received Folger's walnut desk from Socony Mobil Oil. Since that year, it has been used by the Library's director.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Marriage to Emily Clara Jordan==\nHenry Clay Folger met Emily Clara Jordan in the early 1880s at a meeting of the Irving Literary Circle in Brooklyn. Both were close, respectively, with the Pratt siblings Charles and Lillie. Early in their relationship, Henry and Emily connected via Shakespeare. At an 1882 picnic held by the Irving Literary Circle, Charles and Lillie prompted the two to each give a toast; Emily drew from ''[[Othello]]''. while Henry quoted from ''[[As You Like It]]''. She was born in 1858 and was educated at [[Vassar College]]. They married on October 6, 1885 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], where Emily had spent her teenage years. The Folgers had no children. They lived in rented houses in Brooklyn throughout most of their lives, moving to [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in 1895 and to 24 Brevoot Place in 1910, but later purchased an estate in Glen Cove, Long Island in 1929.<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\nThe Folgers took annual vacations to [[The Omni Homestead Resort|The Homestead]] resort in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], where Henry enjoyed participating in golf tournaments in his later years. Though the Folgers had no children, they considered their collection to be their descendants, and Henry was known to refer to his rare books as \"the boys.\"<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Shakespeare Collecting==\nFolger was an avid collector of Shakespeareana, assembling the world's largest collection of [[First Folio]] editions of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\">[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 The Library in the New Age, an article by Robert Darnton]</ref> The first rare book Folger acquired was a 1685 copy of the [[Early texts of Shakespeare's works#Folios|Fourth Folio]], purchased in 1889 for $107.50. He purchased his first original copy of the First Folio four years later, in 1893. Unlike other wealthy collectors of the period, like [[Henry E. Huntington]] and [[J.P. Morgan]], Folger favored \"imperfect\" copies of rare volumes, with their [[marginalia]] and other markings. Following this trend, his Folio collection was marked with diversity in provenance and condition. He preferred to purchase Early Editions of books published between 1567 and 1606, in addition to manuscripts of the period. Based on their collective knowledge of Latin and French, and Emily's proficiency in German, the couple also favored rare volumes published on the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The couple was less interested in art collection, and many of the Shakespeare-related paintings they purchased were misattributed to artists like [[Thomas Gainsborough]].\n\nThe Folgers chose items to purchase from booksellers' catalogues, which were initially perused and marked up by Emily, before she passed them on to Henry, who kept an extensive and precise list of items he intended to bid on. If possible, he inspected an item personally before purchasing it. He also avoided consulting scholarly experts about rare volumes, preferring his own and Emily's expertise, as she received an M.A. from [[Vassar College]] in 1896 for a thesis on Shakespeare. Folger used professional booksellers as middlemen at auctions, believing that the concealment of his identity would keep prices low. Due to the growing size of the collection and their concern for fireproofing, eventually few of the Folgers' acquisitions were stored in their living space. They kept an extensive card catalog at home in Brooklyn, and when traveling, took a smaller, annotated set of check lists along with them. The collection itself was stored among several fireproof warehouse companies throughout Manhattan, in specially-designed wooden cases originally meant to hold two five-gallon cans of oil each. Frederick Fales, a co-worker of Folger's at Standard Oil, initially designed and ordered these air-tight wooden cases for company use.<ref>Grant, pp. 111-118.</ref> Some of the most valuable items were kept in bank vaults, or in a safe in Folger's office.\n\nFolger financed a half-century of collecting with his Standard Oil salary and extensive investments in the company. His high placement at Standard Oil also allowed him to take out loans with his friend Charles Millard Pratt, [[John D. Rockefeller]], and even his wife, to fund his purchases. He generally paid for items in cash, a strategy that earned him the favor of many booksellers who needed immediate funds. Folger also preferred to purchase whole collections, like the [[James Halliwell-Phillipps|Halliwell-Phillipps]] collection, acquired in 1908, because bulk purchases drove down prices of individual items.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\nIn 1909, Folger established a Shakespeare Prize at Amherst; winning students won a cash prize, and their essays joined Folger's collection and currently reside in the Folger Shakespeare Library. Folger also made donations to Amherst College's library, contributing many duplicate volumes purchased at auction to the College. The most valuable of these donations were two leaves from a [[Gutenberg Bible]].<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Folger Shakespeare Library==\n{{main|Folger Shakespeare Library}}\nEarly in his career at Standard Oil and as a collector, Folger doubted that he would eventually have the funds to build a memorial or library for his growing collection, and in 1895 he offered to sell it to John D. Rockefeller, who refused. Before he acquired the funds for what was to become the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], Folger also debated selling the collection to a university.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\nToward the end of [[World War I]], Folger and his wife began searching for a location for his Shakespeare library. Among the sites he and Emily considered were Amherst and Nantucket, Massachusetts, the University of Chicago, New York City, and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], before they settled on a Washington, D.C. site they discovered in 1918 during a layover in the city while traveling to Hot Springs. Folger spent nine years purchasing the fourteen row houses that occupied the block of East Capitol Street between First and Second Streets, which he would demolish to build his Library; thus, they did not make their choice of a site on Capitol Hill public until 1928. Soon afterwards, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a resolution allowing use of the land on East Capitol Street where the Folger Shakespeare Library now stands.\n\nAfter the passage of this legislation, Folger hired [[Paul Philippe Cret]] as the Library's architect, suggested by Alexander Trowbridge, an architect who had married into the Pratt family and stayed on the project as consulting architect. Folger played an integral part in the design and execution of the Library's classical exterior and Tudor interior. The inclusion of an Elizabethan theater within the Library's main building was also Folger's idea, though he intended it as a venue for academic lectures rather than performances. Folger hired sculptor John Gregory to design the relief sculptures that appear on the building's facade. The [[cornerstone]] of the library was laid in 1930, but Henry Folger died soon afterward.  The bulk of his fortune was left in [[Charitable trust|trust]] for the library, with [[Amherst College]] as trust administrator. With additional funding from Emily Folger, the library opened in 1932 on April 23, the date traditionally believed to be Shakespeare's birthday. Folger's collection of Shakespearean works is considered one of the most important resources for scholars of the playwright.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\"/>\n\n==Other interests and activities==\n[[File:Central Cong'l Church, Brooklyn, by L. G. Strand.jpg|thumb|Central Congregational Church]]\nFolger was a trustee of the Hamilton Trust Company, Brooklyn, New York, and a director of Seaboard National Bank in New York.  In 1914 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from [[Amherst College|Amherst]]. Outside of work, his great interests were his Shakespeare collection and, in later life, golf, which he often played with Rockefeller.<ref name=\"Lynch, page 170\">Lynch, page 170.</ref> He was a trustee of the Central Congregational Church in Brooklyn<ref name=\"Lynch, page 170\"/> and established the [[Shakespeare Garden]] at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]].<ref>[http://www.bbg.org/exp/stroll/shakespeare.html Brooklyn Botanic Garden: Shakespeare Garden<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn a 1933 lecture delivered after his death, Emily identified ''[[King Lear]]'' as his favorite of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Death==\nIn May 1930, Henry Folger was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn for surgery on an enlarged prostate. While recovering, he continued to work on the construction and development of his Shakespeare Library from his sickbed. He later had a second prostate operation prior to his death on June 11, 1930. His funeral was held at Brooklyn's Central Congregational Church, where he had been an active member.<ref>Grant, page 163.</ref> Reverend Samuel Parkes Cadman, who, along with his wife, had been close with the Folgers, gave Henry's eulogy.<ref>Mays, Andrea. ''The Millionaire and the Bard''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2015, page 256.</ref> Henry's ashes were interred beneath the Folgers' copy of [[Shakespeare's funerary monument]] in what is now the Folger Shakespeare Library's Old Reading Room. His wife Emily died in 1936.\n\n==Writings==\nFolger wrote ''Petroleum: Its Production and Products'' and articles on Shakespeare and Shakespeareana.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{ external media\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| image1 = \n| image2 = \n| image3 = \n| audio1 = \n| audio2 = \n| audio3 = \n| video1 = [http://www.c-span.org/video/?320687-1/book-discussion-collecting-shakespeare Book Discussion on ''Collecting Shakespeare''], ''C-SPAN'', July 25, 2014\n| video2 = \n| video3 = \n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Folger, Henry Clay}}\n[[Category:1857 births]]\n[[Category:1930 deaths]]\n[[Category:Adelphi University alumni]]\n[[Category:American book and manuscript collectors]]\n[[Category:Amherst College alumni]]\n[[Category:Columbia Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:ExxonMobil people]]\n[[Category:People from Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:Shakespearean scholars]]\n[[Category:Folger Shakespeare Library]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay_Folger"}

for nearly {{convert|400|mi}} through the cities of [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] and [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], intersecting with [[Interstate&nbsp;90]], [[Interstate&nbsp;115]] and [[Interstate&nbsp;315]].  Interstate&nbsp;15 reaches its northern terminus at the international border with [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].\n\nInterstate 15 joins with [[Interstate 90 in Montana|I-90]] and makes a junction with a short, one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) spur route [[Interstate 115]] in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]].\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:Interstate15ruralMT.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Interstate 15, 20 miles south of [[Dillon, Montana]]]]\n[[Image:greatfallscitylights.jpg|250px|thumb|left|I-15 (foreground left to right) goes through the city of Great Falls, MT]]\nI-15 crosses into Montana from Idaho just south of [[Lima Reservoir]], before the route continues northwest through farmland and desert. The freeway turns north at [[Clark Canyon Dam|Clark Canyon Reservoir]], before turning northeast. In the town of [[Dillon, Montana|Dillon]], I-15 passes near [[Clark's Lookout State Park]] before beginning to parallel the [[Big Hole River]]. The freeway then turns away from the river, continuing northeast along Divide Creek through the desert, before splitting away from the creek and heading north. I-15 eventually merges into [[I-90 (MT)|I-90]] at a [[trumpet interchange]].<ref name=\"gmaps\">{{google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/?ll=46.972756,-110.335693&spn=4.108199,9.810791&t=h&z=7|title=Interstate 15 in Montana|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nI-15 and I-90 run concurrently through the city of [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], coming first to an interchange with [[I-115 (MT)|I-115]], signed as Business Loop&nbsp;15 and Business Loop&nbsp;90. I-15 and I-90 pass through a green area in the middle of the city, before I-15 splits off to the northeast on the eastern end of the town. The freeway goes through the forest and plains north of I-90 before winding along Bison Creek and later the [[Boulder River (southwestern Montana)|Boulder River]]. I-15 passes through the town of [[Basin, Montana|Basin]] before leaving the mountains and providing access to [[Boulder, Montana|Boulder]]. Paralleling Beavertown Creek, the road winds through the hills before passing through [[Jefferson City, Montana|Jefferson City]]. The freeway continues into [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], where I-15 intersects [[U.S. Route 12#Montana|US&nbsp;12]] and runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 287#Montana|US 287]] through the outskirts of the city before continuing north through the plains.<ref name=\"gmaps\" />\n\nI-15 and US&nbsp;287 continue along Little Prickly Pear Creek before passing through the town of [[Wolf Creek, Montana|Wolf Creek]] after several miles. Northeast of there, US 287 continues north, while I-15 runs close to the [[Missouri River]]. The freeway provides access to [[Cascade, Montana|Cascade]] and then continues through the plains through [[Ulm, Montana|Ulm]] before turning northeast into the city of [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]]. [[I-315 (MT)|I-315]] and [[U.S. Route 89#Montana|US&nbsp;89]] intersect with I-15 at a trumpet interchange, and US&nbsp;89 continues north and then northwest along I-15 for a few miles before continuing to the west.<ref name=\"gmaps\" />  I-15 continues northwest through farmland before passing near [[Dutton, Montana|Dutton]] and [[Brady, Montana|Brady]], and the city of [[Conrad, Montana|Conrad]].  [[U.S. Route 2#Montana|US&nbsp;2]] intersects I-15 in the town of [[Shelby, Montana|Shelby]].  The freeway passes through the town of [[Sunburst, Montana|Sunburst]], then passes through a final stretch of farmland. Eventually, Interstate&nbsp;15 passes through the last town before Canada, [[Sweet Grass, Montana|Sweet Grass]], and then crosses the international border, becoming [[Alberta Highway 4]].<ref
