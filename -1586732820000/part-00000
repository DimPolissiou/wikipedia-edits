{"title_page": "Misclassification of employees as independent contractors", "text_new": "{{UStaxation}}\n'''Misclassification of employees as independent contractors''' is the way in which the [[United States]] classifies the problem of [[false self-employment]]. It can occur with respect to tax treatment or the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].\n\nThe U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) reports that the IRS claims to lose millions of dollars in uncollected payroll, [[Social Security (United States)|social security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and unemployment insurance taxes because of misclassification of independent contractors by taxpayers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96130t.pdf|title=Issues in Classifying Workers as Employees or Independent Contractors: Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Oversight Committee on Ways and Means|last=Gandhi|first=Natwar M.|date=1996-06-20|website=[[United States General Accounting Office]]|format=PDF|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner]] [[Mark W. Everson]] in a statement made November 3, 2005, IRS audits of small businesses organized as corporations increased from 7,294 in 2004 to 17,867 in 2005. [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=150358,00.html]\n\n==Taxation==\nEmployers must report the incomes of employees and independent contractors using the IRS forms [[Form W-2|W-2]] and [[Form 1099-MISC|1099]], respectively. Employers pay various [[tax]]es (i.e. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes, [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment tax]]es, etc.) on the wages of a worker that is classified as an employee. These taxes are generally not paid by the employer on the compensation of a worker classified as an independent contractor. Instead, the contractor is responsible for their employer's share of the taxes when paying self-employment taxes at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasovertimeattorney.com/blog/withholding-for-payroll-taxes-and-misclassifying-workers-as-independent-contractors-why-this-ca.cfm|title=Withholding for Payroll Taxes & Misclassifying Workers as Independent Contractors: Why This Can Hurt You at Tax Time.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nClassification affects whether a worker can receive unemployment benefits. In many states, independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment benefits because nothing has been paid into the unemployment insurance fund on their behalf. Employers who have no employees are not required to make payments to the unemployment insurance fund (since there is no one to claim benefits).\n\nWorkers classified as independent contractors whose contract is terminated can contact their state unemployment agency (for example [[Employment Development Department]] (EDD) in California) and file a claim for unemployment. EDD investigates and determines whether the worker was misclassified, and potentially award unemployment benefits. According to state-level studies, 10% to 20% of employers misclassify at least one worker as an independent contractor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/independent-contractor-misclassification/|title=(In)dependent Contractor Misclassification|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reclassification==\nIRS reclassification as an employee occurs where persons claimed as (or claiming to be) [[independent contractors]] are recategorized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), or by state tax authorities, as [[Form W-2|W-2]] [[employee]]s. The reclassification can result in the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and back-taxes for which the [[employer]] is generally liable.\n\n==Employee vs. independent contractor==\nIRS regulations state that a worker is an employee if the employer can control what is to be done and how it is to be done.

[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=150358,00.html]\n\n==Taxation==\nEmployers must report the incomes of employees and independent contractors using the IRS forms [[Form W-2|W-2]] and [[Form 1099-MISC|1099]], respectively. Employers pay various [[tax]]es (i.e. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes, [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment tax]]es, etc.) on the wages of a worker that is classified as an employee. These taxes are generally not paid by the employer on the compensation of a worker classified as an independent contractor. Instead, the contractor is responsible for their employer's share of the taxes when paying self-employment taxes at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasovertimeattorney.com/blog/withholding-for-payroll-taxes-and-misclassifying-workers-as-independent-contractors-why-this-ca.cfm|title=Withholding for Payroll Taxes & Misclassifying Workers as Independent Contractors: Why This Can Hurt You at Tax Time.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nClassification affects whether a worker can receive unemployment benefits. In many states, independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment benefits because nothing has been paid into the unemployment insurance fund on their behalf. Employers who have no employees are not required to make payments to the unemployment insurance fund (since there is no one to claim benefits).\n\nWorkers classified as independent contractors whose contract is terminated can contact their state unemployment agency (for example [[Employment Development Department]] (EDD) in California) and file a claim for unemployment. EDD investigates and determines whether the worker was misclassified, and potentially award unemployment benefits. According to state-level studies, 10% to 20% of employers misclassify at least one worker as an independent contractor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/independent-contractor-misclassification/|title=(In)dependent Contractor Misclassification|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reclassification==\nIRS reclassification as an employee occurs where persons claimed as (or claiming to be) [[independent contractors]] are recategorized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), or by state tax authorities, as [[Form W-2|W-2]] [[employee]]s. The reclassification can result in the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and back-taxes for which the [[employer]] is generally liable.\n\n==Employee vs. independent contractor==\nIRS regulations state that a worker is an employee if the employer can control what is to be done and how it is to be done.

In the early 1980s, she advanced the ideas and strategies proposed by the Pictures Generation Movement and began working with found images, re-photography, appropriation, film and installation, taking her place among those artists who have helped to redefine photography. She takes an intuitive approach to creating conceptual works in the construction of a coherent visual language.\u00a0 A retrospective exhibition of her work was organized in 2010 by the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and traveled to the ICA in Philadelphia<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/94790029.html|title=A Conversation: Jennifer Bolande and David Robbins|website=archive.jsonline.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>, and the Luckman Gallery at California State University in Los Angeles.

Dr. House also is suspected to have cancer by his staff. Also appearing is [[Kurtwood Smith]]. The episode marks the directorial debut of executive producer Katie Jacobs.\n\n==Plot==\nPatrick Obyedkov, a respected pianist, suffers a painful involuntary muscle contraction in his left hand during a piano concert. The case attracts the attention of [[Gregory House|House]], who learns from Patrick's father that Patrick suffered severe [[brain damage]] from a bus accident that also killed his mother. House is intrigued as to why Patrick, who had no musical training at the time of the accident, could suddenly play the piano flawlessly after suffering a severe injury.\n\nWhile trying to deduce the origin of the brain rewiring responsible for Patrick's mysterious gift of music, House and his team must stop the deadly bleeding that is quickly threatening his life. Patrick's condition worsens, and House presents a difficult option to Patrick's father: either perform a [[hemispherectomy]], allowing Patrick to live normally but not play the piano, or to continue as he is and never live a normal life.\n\nPatrick's father, after overcoming his anger at the suggestion, opts for the surgery. After the procedure, Patrick loses his ability to speak, though House says this will return. While the father is talking with House about his son's recovery, Patrick buttons his shirt, a task which he had previously been incapable of doing.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Allison Cameron (House)|Cameron]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) discovers that House has been in contact with a hospital in Massachusetts and suspects that House may be looking to take a new job there. When [[Lisa Cuddy|Cuddy]] contacts the hospital, she learns that House has been in contact with a brain [[cancer]] specialist \u2014 not as a job applicant, but as a patient for a clinical trial. When confronted by his team, House denies the gravity of the situation and resents their interference, and they are forced to contend with the possibility his condition may be more serious than he's letting on.\n\nNear the end of the episode, the team discovers that the medical file sent to the hospital in Massachusetts did not belong to House, and he intended to trick the doctors at the university into implanting a \"cool drug\" into the pleasure center of his brain, possibly in order to get over the pain in his leg.\n\n==Awards==\nThis episode was submitted for consideration in the categories of \"[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]]\", \"Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series\" and \"[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor - Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]]\" on [[Hugh Laurie]]'s behalf for the [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards]].<ref>Boomer, (June 5, 2007) \"[http://goldderbyforums.latimes.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/1106078764/m/53610293 2007 Emmys Confirmed Episode Submissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822032609/http://goldderbyforums.latimes.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/1106078764/m/53610293 |date=2007-08-22 }}, [[Los Angeles Times]] Envelope Forum.

[[Thucydides]]  also reports that Korkyra was one of the three great naval powers of fifth century BC Greece, along with [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Corinth]].<ref>Thucydides, ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' 1.36.3</ref> Medieval castles punctuating strategic locations across the city are a legacy of struggles in the Middle Ages against invasions by pirates and the Ottomans. The city has become known since the Middle Ages as ''Kastropolis'' (Castle City) because of its two castles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corfu.gr/web/guest/home|work=Municipality of Corfu |title=Home Page |accessdate=2010-03-23 }}</ref> \n\nFrom 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]], with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence.<ref>[https://bjuniornewblog.blogspot.com/2019/02/italian-corfu-city.html Italian Corfu city]</ref> The city was subjected to four notable sieges in [[Siege of Corfu (1537)|1537]], 1571, 1573 and [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1714\u20131718)#The_Siege_of_Corfu|1716]], in which the strength of the city defenses asserted itself time after time, mainly because of the effectiveness of the powerful Venetian fortifications. [[Will Durant]] claimed that Corfu owed to the [[Republic of Venice]] the fact that it was the only part of Greece never conquered by the Ottomans.<ref>Will Durant. ''The Renaissance''. page 684.

Near [[Gasturi]] stands the [[Pompei]]an style [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], the palace built for the Empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elizabeth of Austria]], and purchased in 1907 by the German emperor, [[William II of Germany|William II]].\n\nOf the thirty-seven Greek churches the most important are the cathedral, dedicated to Our Lady of the Cave; [[St. Spiridon]]'s, with the tomb of the patron saint of the island; and the suburban church of St Jason and St Sosipater, reputedly the oldest in the island. {{Cn|date=April 2017}} The city is the seat of a Greek and a Roman Catholic archbishop; and it possesses a gymnasium, a theatre, an agricultural and industrial society, and a library and museum preserved in the buildings formerly devoted to the university, which was founded by [[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford]] (1766\u20131827, himself the first chancellor in 1824) in 1823, but disestablished on the cessation of the British protectorate.\n\nBased on the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]] evaluation of the old town of Corfu,<ref name=\"ICOMOS\"/> it was inscribed on the World Heritage List. The ICOMOS experts have noted that \"about 70% of the pre-20th century buildings date from the British period\" and that \"whole blocks were destroyed\" in the Old Town by the German World War II blitzes; these were \"replaced by new constructions in the 1960s and 1970s\". The urban fabric was classified as being predominantly of the Neoclassical period \"without special architectural features for which it could be distinguished\".<ref name=\"ICOMOS\"/>\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Corfu town.jpg|thumb|View of the old town]]\n[[File:20140418 corfu290.JPG|thumb|Agion Panton Street]]\n\nThe town of Corfu stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian [[citadel]] ({{lang-el|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf}}) is cut off from it by an artificial [[moat|fosse]] formed in a natural gully, with a salt-water ditch at the bottom, that serves also as a kind of marina known as ''Contra-Fossa''. The old city having grown up within fortifications, where every metre of ground was precious, is a labyrinth of narrow streets paved with cobblestones, sometimes tortuous but mostly pleasant, colourful and sparkling clean. {{Cn|date=July 2017}} These streets are called \"kantounia\" ({{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1}}) and the older ones sometimes follow the gentle irregularities of the ground while many of them are too narrow for vehicular traffic. There is promenade by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa ({{lang|el|\u0393\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1}}), and also an esplanade between the town and the citadel called {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} ({{lang|el|\u039b\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd}}) where upscale restaurants and European style bistros abound. The origin of the name ''Liston'' has several explanations: many former Venetian cities have a square of that name, coming from a [[Venetian language|Venetian]] word meaning ''evening promenade'', but it can also refer to the closed-list aspect of an up-scale area reserved to the nobility registered in the [[Libro d'Oro]].\n\nThe citadel was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Greek 500 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1983-2001.<ref>[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en Bank of Greece]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328051044/http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en |date=March 28, 2009 }}.

The city (population in 2011: 39,674 residents and the whole island 111,975) is a major tourist attraction and Greek regional centre and has played an important role in Greek history since antiquity.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Ionian islands under Venetian rule|Septinsular Republic}}\nThe ancient city of Corfu, known as [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]], took part in the [[Battle of Sybota]] which was a catalyst for the [[Peloponnesian War]], and, according to Thucydides, the largest naval battle between Greek city states until that time. [[Thucydides]]  also reports that Korkyra was one of the three great naval powers of fifth century BC Greece, along with [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Corinth]].<ref>Thucydides, ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' 1.36.3</ref> Medieval castles punctuating strategic locations across the city are a legacy of struggles in the Middle Ages against invasions by pirates and the Ottomans. The city has become known since the Middle Ages as ''Kastropolis'' (Castle City) because of its two castles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corfu.gr/web/guest/home|work=Municipality of Corfu |title=Home Page |accessdate=2010-03-23 }}</ref> \n\nFrom 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]], with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence.<ref>[https://bjuniornewblog.blogspot.com/2019/02/italian-corfu-city.html Italian Corfu city]</ref> The city was subjected to four notable sieges in [[Siege of Corfu (1537)|1537]], 1571, 1573 and [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1714\u20131718)#The_Siege_of_Corfu|1716]], in which the strength of the city defenses asserted itself time after time, mainly because of the effectiveness of the powerful Venetian fortifications. [[Will Durant]] claimed that Corfu owed to the [[Republic of Venice]] the fact that it was the only part of Greece never conquered by the Ottomans.<ref>Will Durant. ''The Renaissance''. page 684.

The [[Palace of St. Michael and St. George]], built in 1815 by Sir [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] (1759\u20131824; Lord High Commissioner of the [[Ionian Islands]]) is a large structure of white Maltese stone. Near [[Gasturi]] stands the [[Pompei]]an style [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], the palace built for the Empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elizabeth of Austria]], and purchased in 1907 by the German emperor, [[William II of Germany|William II]].\n\nOf the thirty-seven Greek churches the most important are the cathedral, dedicated to Our Lady of the Cave; [[St. Spiridon]]'s, with the tomb of the patron saint of the island; and the suburban church of St Jason and St Sosipater, reputedly the oldest in the island. {{Cn|date=April 2017}} The city is the seat of a Greek and a Roman Catholic archbishop; and it possesses a gymnasium, a theatre, an agricultural and industrial society, and a library and museum preserved in the buildings formerly devoted to the university, which was founded by [[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford]] (1766\u20131827, himself the first chancellor in 1824) in 1823, but disestablished on the cessation of the British protectorate.\n\nBased on the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]] evaluation of the old town of Corfu,<ref name=\"ICOMOS\"/> it was inscribed on the World Heritage List. The ICOMOS experts have noted that \"about 70% of the pre-20th century buildings date from the British period\" and that \"whole blocks were destroyed\" in the Old Town by the German World War II blitzes; these were \"replaced by new constructions in the 1960s and 1970s\". The urban fabric was classified as being predominantly of the Neoclassical period \"without special architectural features for which it could be distinguished\".<ref name=\"ICOMOS\"/>\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Corfu town.jpg|thumb|View of the old town]]\n[[File:20140418 corfu290.JPG|thumb|Agion Panton Street]]\n\nThe town of Corfu stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian [[citadel]] ({{lang-el|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf}}) is cut off from it by an artificial [[moat|fosse]] formed in a natural gully, with a salt-water ditch at the bottom, that serves also as a kind of marina known as ''Contra-Fossa''. The old city having grown up within fortifications, where every metre of ground was precious, is a labyrinth of narrow streets paved with cobblestones, sometimes tortuous but mostly pleasant, colourful and sparkling clean. {{Cn|date=July 2017}} These streets are called \"kantounia\" ({{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1}}) and the older ones sometimes follow the gentle irregularities of the ground while many of them are too narrow for vehicular traffic. There is promenade by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa ({{lang|el|\u0393\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1}}), and also an esplanade between the town and the citadel called {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} ({{lang|el|\u039b\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd}}) where upscale restaurants and European style bistros abound. The origin of the name ''Liston'' has several explanations: many former Venetian cities have a square of that name, coming from a [[Venetian language|Venetian]] word meaning ''evening promenade'', but it can also refer to the closed-list aspect of an up-scale area reserved to the nobility registered in the [[Libro d'Oro]].\n\nThe citadel was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Greek 500 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1983-2001.<ref>[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en Bank of Greece]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328051044/http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en |date=March 28, 2009 }}.

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\" ([[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]). She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> The song's writing process began at Warren's home in [[Wyoming]] where she and Kirkpatrick were attempting to write a second hit for Lipa following their success with \"New Rules\".

It was influenced by similar basslines by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]] that he listened to growing up. Kirkpatrick described the production as a combination of his favourite [[disco]] and \"Euro-funk\" music, and cited music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]] as an influence.<ref name=\"SU\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen\n | filename    = Dua Lipa Don't Start Now.ogg\n | pos         =\n | title       = \"Don't Start Now\"\n | description = A 16-second sample of the second verse where a [[rhythm guitar]] loop is added and Lipa sings with pauses between certain lyrics.<ref name=\"TSJ\"/>\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\"Don't Start Now\" has been widely described by music critics as a [[nu-disco]] song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rs-charts-young-thug-hot-songs-910833/|title=RS Charts: Young Thug's 'Hot' Hits Number One|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=11 November 2019|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review-dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-is-a-euphoric-escape-hatch-to-pops-past/|title=Review: Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia Is a Euphoric Escape Hatch to Pop's Past|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=25 March 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Crack\">{{cite web|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/album-reviews/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia/|title=Dua Lipa \u2013 'Future Nostalgia' review|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[Crack Magazine]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9344710/dua-lipa-new-rules-success-future-nostalgia|title=Dua Lipa's New Rules To Success: 10 Steps She Took to Become a Star||last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"musicOMH\">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia|title=Dua Lipa \u2013 Future Nostalgia|last=Smith|first=Nick|website=[[musicOMH]]|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> It has numerous [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] tropes, and elements of [[Eurodance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/05/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review|title=Dua Lipa: Future Nostalgia review \u2013 a dazzling dance through the decades|last=Empire|first=Kitty|author-link=Kitty Empire|website=[[The Observer]]|date=5 April 2020|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/business/chart-beat/8550118/dua-lipa-dont-start-now-five-burning-questions|title=Five Burning Questions: Billboard Staffers Discuss Dua Lipa's 'Don't Start Now' Hitting the Top 10|author=Billboard Staff|website=Billboard|date=4 February 2020|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/dua-lipas-new-album-future-nostalgia-is-an-apocalypse-game-changer-and-the-best-album-of-2020-so-far|title=Dua Lipa's 'Future Nostalgia' Is an Apocalypse Game-changer\u2014and the Best Album of 2020 So Far|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref> The song is composed in [[Time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time]] and the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[B minor]], with a [[tempo]] of 124 beats per minute.

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\" ([[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]). She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> The song's writing process began at Warren's home in [[Wyoming]] where she and Kirkpatrick were attempting to write a second hit for Lipa following their success with \"New Rules\". During a session with Lipa and Ailin, they all contributed to lyrics that reflected the singer's \"sophisticated, confident, sassiness\".<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[bassline]] in the song sounds live, Kirkpatrick created it with [[MIDI]]. It was influenced by similar basslines by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]] that he listened to growing up.

He takes the note back to the Man Cave, where Schwoz tries to identify any DNA that could find the creator of the note; however, nothing is found. Meanwhile, Piper tries to send back a spray tan gun when she believes she was sent the wrong item and later decides to operate a tanning salon from home. When Henry and Charlotte arrive home, Henry heads to his room where he finds Jasper waiting for him. Shocked, Henry tries to explain, but is unable to speak, assuming that Jasper knows he's Kid Danger. Downstairs, Piper tells Charlotte that Jasper told her his secret. Charlotte asks what he told her and Piper says that Henry had promised to see Galaxy Wars 10 on Saturday with Jasper, but his mom wanted to see it on opening night, which was Wednesday, so Henry had gone with her. Meanwhile, Henry's father is arrested on the misunderstanding that he was running an illegal tanning operation. Frazzled by the misunderstanding, Charlotte rushes to Henry's room to tell him that Jasper doesn't know his secret identity; however, it's too late as Henry has revealed to Jasper that he's Kid Danger. Jasper faints in excitement, and Henry contacts Captain Man and asks him to come to his house. When Captain Man gets there, they get into an argument about Henry's oath to never tell anyone he's Kid Danger. Afterward, Captain Man decides they have to erase Jasper's memory\u2014including memories of his best friend\u2014to prevent any more exposure. Henry contemplates and asks if he can spend a few minutes with Jasper before his memory is wiped. He and Jasper relapse on their past, with Jasper saying he is proud of Henry. Emotional by this and not willing to lose his best friend, Henry eventually resists wiping Jasper's memory and begs Captain Man not to. He relents, but finally agrees and takes Jasper under his wing.\n\n''Guest stars'': Kelly Sullivan as Mrs. Hart, Jeffrey Nichols Brown as Mr. Hart, Michael D.

The next day, Vice-Mayor Willard preside over Kid Danger's memorial which is attended by friends and foes alike. After changing back to Ray, he finds Henry who now has forcefield abilities with Ray mentioning that his indestructable abilities are slowly being restored. Ray states to Henry that it's time for him to leave Swellview since he's a hero now. Miles, Mika, Chapa, and Bose state to Henry and Ray that they have taken the name of Danger Force. Vice-Mayor Willard unveils two statues of Kid Danger as Henry takes his leave. In Dystopia, Henry, Charlotte, and Jasper are living their new lives as Henry is now operating as the local superhero with the help of Charlotte and Jasper. A few weeks later, Ray and Schwoz open the Swellview Academy of the Gifted to teach the Danger Force how to be superheroes.\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Henry Danger characters|List of ''Henry Danger'' characters]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/henry-danger/listings/|title=''Henry Danger'' Episode Listings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Zap2it Season 1\">{{cite web|url=https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH01953422&tabName=guide&season=1|title=''Henry Danger'' Season 1 Episode Guide|publisher=[[Zap2it]]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Zap2it Season 2\">{{cite web|url=https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH01953422&tabName=guide&season=2|title=''Henry Danger'' Season 2 Episode Guide|publisher=[[Zap2it]]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Zap2it Season 3\">{{cite web|url=https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH01953422&tabName=guide&season=3|title=''Henry Danger'' Season 3 Episode Guide|publisher=[[Zap2it]]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Zap2it Season 4\">{{cite web|url=https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH01953422&tabName=guide&season=4|title=''Henry Danger'' Season 4 Episode Guide|publisher=[[Zap2it]]}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Zap2it Season 5\">{{cite web|url=https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH01953422&tabName=guide&season=5|title=''Henry Danger'' Season 5 Episode Guide|publisher=[[Zap2it]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henry Danger episodes, List of}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of American comedy television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Nickelodeon television series episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Wugapodes", "label": "safe", "comment": "padlock", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Henry_Danger_episodes"}

The company assumed the new name ''Original Ballet Russe'' after a split between de Basil and Blum. De Basil led the renamed company, while Blum and others founded a new company under the name [[Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo]]. It was a large scale professional ballet company which toured extensively in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, the United States, and Central and South America. It closed down operations in 1947.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Dissolution of Ballets Russes and formation of Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo ===\nThe company's name is derived from the [[Ballets Russes]] of impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. The last season of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was 1929, during which it toured and performed in both [[London, England]], and [[Paris, France]]. During the final season, it produced the new ballets ''[[The Prodigal Son (ballet)|The Prodigal Son]]'' and ''Le Bal''. The company performed for the final time in London at the [[Covent Garden Theatre]] on July 26, 1929. Diaghliev died of complications from [[diabetes]] a month later, on August 19, 1929.\n\nIn 1931, with the help from financier [[Serge Denham]], [[Ren\u00e9 Blum (ballet)|Ren\u00e9 Blum]] and Colonel [[Wassily de Basil]] formed Les Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo. One of the new company's [[board of directors|board]] members was American businessman [[Jim Thompson (designer)|Jim Thompson]].\n\n=== Massine and Balanchine join ===\nThe company hired [[Leonide Massine]] and [[George Balanchine]] as choreographers. The majority of the works performed had previously been staged by Diaghilev's company, but other new works were commissioned, such as ''Jeux d'enfants'', with music by [[Georges Bizet]] and sets by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Featured dancers included [[David Lichine]] (who soon began choreographing ballets for the company), and the \"[[Baby Ballerinas|baby ballerinas]]\" [[Irina Baronova]], [[Tamara Toumanova]], and [[Tatiana Riabouchinska]]. The company conductor was [[Efrem Kurtz]],<ref>Anderson, Martin, \"A Century in Music: Manuel Rosenthal in Conversation\" (April 2000). ''Tempo'' (New Ser.) (212): pp. 31-37.</ref> who stayed until 1942, touring with them extensively, and the librettist was [[Boris Kochno]]. The company gave its first performance in [[Monte Carlo]] in 1932.\n\nWithout consulting Blum, Col. de Basil dropped Balanchine after one year<ref name=Homans /> \u2013 ostensibly because he thought that audiences preferred the works choreographed by Massine. Librettist Kochno was also let go, while dancer Toumanova left the company when Balanchine was fired. According to historian Katherine Sorley-Walker, however, Balanchine and Kochno left of their own volition, because they found Blum and De Basil \"dictatorial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=De Basil's Ballets Russes|last=Sorley-Walker|first=Katherine|publisher=Atheneum|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=20}}</ref>\n\n=== Blum leaves, Nijinska joins ===\nCol. de Basil and Blum had an acrimonious relationship,<ref name=Homans>Homans, Jennifer.

However, the ballets which Massine had choreographed while under contract with Col. de Basil were owned by his company.

Col. de Basil renamed his company again, calling it the ''[[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Russian Ballet''<ref name=Answers /> and bringing on [[Michel Fokine]] as resident choreographer.\n\n[[Sol Hurok]] ended up managing Blum and Massine's company as well. The Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo and the Original Ballet Russe often performed near each other. Under its new name, the company's first season, starting May 1938, was at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Massine's Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo had a season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane a few hundred yards away,<ref name=\"andros\" /> and this season was known as the \"London Ballet Wars\".\n\nAfter London, Hurok booked both of the companies to perform in New York (with de Basil's company playing the [[Hollywood Theatre (New York)|Hollywood Theatre]]), for a total of fifteen weeks, making it the longest ballet season of New York.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Along with management, the two companies also shared dancers. Hurok continued to have the companies perform near each other; he hoped to reunite the companies,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} but ultimately was unsuccessful. The company then spent some weeks on a \"[[whistle stop]]\" tour of America, sleeping on the special train hired to transport them.\n\nIn 1939, the company spent a six-week season at [[Covent Garden]]. English ballerina [[Mona Inglesby]] danced with the company that season.\n\nFinally, in 1939, Col. de Basil gave the company its final name, the ''Original Ballet Russe''.<ref name=Answers />\n\nThe company toured extensively throughout Europe and [[Australia]], visiting Australia in 1936\u201337, 1938\u201339, and 1939\u201340.<ref name=Amanda>Amanda.

The company assumed the new name ''Original Ballet Russe'' after a split between de Basil and Blum. De Basil led the renamed company, while Blum and others founded a new company under the name [[Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo]]. It was a large scale professional ballet company which toured extensively in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, the United States, and Central and South America. It closed down operations in 1947.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Dissolution of Ballets Russes and formation of Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo ===\nThe company's name is derived from the [[Ballets Russes]] of impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. The last season of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was 1929, during which it toured and performed in both [[London, England]], and [[Paris, France]]. During the final season, it produced the new ballets ''[[The Prodigal Son (ballet)|The Prodigal Son]]'' and ''Le Bal''. The company performed for the final time in London at the [[Covent Garden Theatre]] on July 26, 1929. Diaghliev died of complications from [[diabetes]] a month later, on August 19, 1929.\n\nIn 1931, with the help from financier [[Serge Denham]], [[Ren\u00e9 Blum (ballet)|Ren\u00e9 Blum]] and Colonel [[Wassily de Basil]] formed Les Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo. One of the new company's [[board of directors|board]] members was American businessman [[Jim Thompson (designer)|Jim Thompson]].\n\n=== Massine and Balanchine join ===\nThe company hired [[Leonide Massine]] and [[George Balanchine]] as choreographers. The majority of the works performed had previously been staged by Diaghilev's company, but other new works were commissioned, such as ''Jeux d'enfants'', with music by [[George Bizet]] and sets by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Featured dancers included [[David Lichine]] (who soon began choreographing ballets for the company), and the \"[[Baby Ballerinas|baby ballerinas]]\" [[Irina Baronova]], [[Tamara Toumanova]], and [[Tatiana Riabouchinska]]. The company conductor was [[Efrem Kurtz]],<ref>Anderson, Martin, \"A Century in Music: Manuel Rosenthal in Conversation\" (April 2000). ''Tempo'' (New Ser.) (212): pp. 31-37.</ref> who stayed until 1942, touring with them extensively, and the librettist was [[Boris Kochno]]. The company gave its first performance in [[Monte Carlo]] in 1932.\n\nWithout consulting Blum, Col. de Basil dropped Balanchine after one year<ref name=Homans /> \u2013 ostensibly because he thought that audiences preferred the works choreographed by Massine. Librettist Kochno was also let go, while dancer Toumanova left the company when Balanchine was fired. According to historian Katherine Sorley-Walker, however, Balanchine and Kochno left of their own volition, because they found Blum and De Basil \"dictatorial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=De Basil's Ballets Russes|last=Sorley-Walker|first=Katherine|publisher=Atheneum|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=20}}</ref>\n\n=== Blum leaves, Nijinska joins ===\nCol. de Basil and Blum had an acrimonious relationship,<ref name=Homans>Homans, Jennifer.

However, the ballets which Massine had choreographed while under contract with Col. de Basil were owned by his company. Massine sued de Basil in [[London]] to regain the intellectual property rights to his own works. He also sued to claim the ''Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo'' name.<ref name=\"andros\" /> The jury decided that de Basil owned Massine's ballets created between 1932 and 1937, but not those created before 1932.<ref name=\"australiadancing\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110808045124/http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/4861.html australiadancing] through the Internet Archive</ref> It also ruled that both successor companies could use the name ''Ballet Russe'' \u2013 but only Massine and Blum's company could be called [[Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo]]. Col. de Basil renamed his company again, calling it the ''[[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Russian Ballet''<ref name=Answers /> and bringing on [[Michel Fokine]] as resident choreographer.\n\n[[Sol Hurok]] ended up managing Blum and Massine's company as well. The Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo and the Original Ballet Russe often performed near each other. Under its new name, the company's first season, starting May 1938, was at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Massine's Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo had a season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane a few hundred yards away,<ref name=\"andros\" /> and this season was known as the \"London Ballet Wars\".\n\nAfter London, Hurok booked both of the companies to perform in New York (with de Basil's company playing the [[Hollywood Theatre (New York)|Hollywood Theatre]]), for a total of fifteen weeks, making it the longest ballet season of New York.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Along with management, the two companies also shared dancers. Hurok continued to have the companies perform near each other; he hoped to reunite the companies,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} but ultimately was unsuccessful. The company then spent some weeks on a \"[[whistle stop]]\" tour of America, sleeping on the special train hired to transport them.\n\nIn 1939, the company spent a six-week season at [[Covent Garden]]. English ballerina [[Mona Inglesby]] danced with the company that season.\n\nFinally, in 1939, Col. de Basil gave the company its final name, the ''Original Ballet Russe''.<ref name=Answers />\n\nThe company toured extensively throughout Europe and [[Australia]], visiting Australia in 1936\u201337, 1938\u201339, and 1939\u201340.<ref name=Amanda>Amanda.
