Seeing her films being successful, Waheeda decided to experiment with roles at this stage of career. She accepted ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'', opposite her old co-star [[Sunil Dutt]], with whom she had previously in the sixties had hits such as ''[[Ek Phool Char Kaante]]'', ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'', ''[[Meri Bhabhi]]'' and ''[[Darpan]]''.

This, she regards the mistake of her career, as after this film flopped, suddenly people started offering her motherly roles to heroes.[[File:Nanda-Waheeda-Helen-Sadhana.jpg|thumb|200x200px|(L-R) [[Nanda (actress)|Nanda]], Waheeda Rehman, [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] and [[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]] ]]Film expert Rajesh Subramanian reported that Manmohan Desai had approached Rehman, on behalf of Shammi Kapoor, during the making of ''Naseeb''. In the song \"John Jani Janardhan\", Shammi Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman make a grand entry holding hands. Incidentally this was the first time the two stars appeared together on screen. Later she also did Manmohan Desai's ''[[Coolie (1983 Hindi film)|Coolie]]'' and ''[[Allah Rakha (film)|Allah Rakha]]''.\n\nFrom the mid-seventies, Waheeda's career as lead heroine ended and her career as character actor began.

She played the central character in the Mahesh Bhatt directed film ''Swayam'' that starred Akash Khurana and Anupam Kher. She also appeared in a tele-series being directed by Gulzar.\n\nIn recent years she made a comeback playing elderly mother and grandmother roles in ''[[Om Jai Jagadish]]'' (2002), ''[[Water (2005 film)|Water]]'' (2005), ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (2006), [[15, Park Avenue]] and ''[[Delhi 6]]'' (2009) which were all critically acclaimed.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:WaheedaRehman.jpg|thumb|Rehman in 2012|alt=|316x316px]]\nA biography has been written and published in 2014 about Rehman, entitled ''Conversations with Waheeda Rehman'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqfzAgAAQBAJ|title=Conversations with Waheeda Rehman|last=Kabir|first=Nasreen Munni|date=2015-03-15|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9789351186427|language=en}}</ref> which consist of interviews collected by author and director [[Nasreen Munni Kabir]].\n\nAt the beginning of her career, Rehman is rumoured to have been involved with her frequent collaborator Guru Dutt.

Dutt's existing marriage and her film successes with other directors caused them to drift apart personally and professionally, although they continued to work together into the 1960s.

She won her first Filmfare Award\u2014[[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]\u2014and soon after, she became a sought-over actress in the latter half of the 1960s. ''Guide'' became [[List of Indian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|India's official entry to the Oscars]] and a staple film in Hindi cinema.\n\nHer peak continued when she was paired with other well-established superstars, namely [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Rajendra Kumar]], [[Raj Kapoor]], and [[Rajesh Khanna]]. Among her most acclaimed films of late 1960s include ''[[Teesri Kasam]]'' (1966), ''[[Ram Aur Shyam]]'' (1967), [[Neel Kamal (1968 film)|''Neel Kamal'']] (1968) and [[Khamoshi (1970 film)|Khamoshi]] (1969). The last three movies all earned Rehman consecutive nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Actress each, with her winning<ref name=\":0\" /> her second Filmfare Award in ''Neel Kamal''. In her role in ''Khamoshi'' starring alongside Rajesh Khanna and [[Dharmendra]], it is believed to be Rehman's finest acting performance. She plays a nurse who has gone mentally insane after falling in love with one of her patients, and eventually is sent to her own mental institution.\n\nOther films that were commercially successful were ''[[Patthar Ke Sanam]]'' (1967) and ''[[Aadmi (1968 film)|Aadmi]]'' (1968), and box office failures include ''[[Dharti]]'' (1970) and [[Shatranj (1969 film)|''Shatranj'']] (1969). At the end of the 1960s, Rehman ranked a new record amongst herself in becoming the second-paid actress in Bollywood, from 1964-1969.

Seeing her films being successful, Waheeda decided to experiment with roles at this stage of career. She accepted ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'', opposite her old co-star [[Sunil Dutt]], with whom she had previously in the sixties had hits such as ''[[Ek Phool Char Kaante]]'', ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'', ''[[Meri Bhabhi]]'' and ''[[Darpan]]''. Her performance was appreciated by critics, but the film failed at the box office. But Waheeda continued to experiment with roles and accepted the offer to play a mother to [[Jaya Bhaduri]] in ''[[Phagun (1973 film)|Phagun]]'' (1973). This, she regards the mistake of her career, as after this film flopped, suddenly people started offering her motherly roles to heroes.[[File:Nanda-Waheeda-Helen-Sadhana.jpg|thumb|200x200px|(L-R) [[Nanda (actress)|Nanda]], Waheeda Rehman, [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] and [[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]] ]]Film expert Rajesh Subramanian reported that Manmohan Desai had approached Rehman, on behalf of Shammi Kapoor, during the making of ''Naseeb''.

Six actresses have won the award twice; in chronological order, they are [[Shashikala]], [[Simi Garewal]], [[Raakhee]], [[Rohini Hattangadi]], [[Aruna Irani]] and [[Konkona Sen Sharma]].\n* Four actresses have won the award in consecutive years: [[Shashikala]] (1963\u20131964), [[Supriya Pathak]] (1982\u20131983), [[Jaya Bachchan]] (2001\u20132002), and [[Konkona Sen Sharma]] (2007\u20132008).\n* [[Aruna Irani]] holds the record of maximum nominations (10), followed by [[Raakhee]] / [[Shashikala]] (8), [[Farida Jalal]] / [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]] / [[Rani Mukerji]] (7) and [[Rekha]] (6).\n* [[Shashikala]] holds the record of most consecutive nominations with 6 between 1963 and 1967, being nominated twice in 1967, winning twice in 1963 and 1964. \n* Nine actresses hold the record of maximum nominations in a single year. In chronological order, they are: [[Shubha Khote]] (1962), [[Shashikala]] (1967), [[Nutan]] (1974), [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]] (1975), [[Smita Patil]] (1984), [[Sushmita Sen]] (2000), [[Rani Mukerji]] (2005), [[Konkona Sen Sharma]] (2008) and [[Seema Pahwa|Seema Bhargava Pahwa]] (2018). Among these, Sushmita Sen, Rani Mukerji and Konkona Sen Sharma won the awards in their respective years. The other six thus hold the record of not winning despite having multiple nominations, in a particular year .\n* [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]] holds the record of maximum nominations without ever winning, with 7, followed by [[Reema Lagoo]], [[Waheeda Rehman]], [[Tanvi Azmi]] and [[Ratna Pathak|Ratna Pathak Shah]] with 4 nominations each. \n* [[Jaya Bachchan]], who won 3 awards among 3 nominations, holds the record of winning maximum awards, without ever losing, whenever been nominated. Bachchan also holds the record of maximum awards in minimum time, winning thrice in four years. She won in 2001, 2002 and 2004. \n* [[Surekha Sikri]], in 2019, became the eldest winner at age 74, whilst [[Ayesha Kapur]], became the youngest winner and youngest nominee, at age 11. Kamini Kaushal, in 2020, became the eldest nominee at age 93 for her role in the movie Kabir Signh\n* [[Karisma Kapoor]] and [[Kareena Kapoor]] are the only siblings who have both won the award.\n* There was no repeat winner in the 1950s, on the contrary in the '60s three actresses had two wins, namely, [[Nirupa Roy]], [[Shashikala]] and [[Simi Garewal]]. Again, '70s had no repeat wins, but [[Supriya Pathak]] achieved two consecutive wins in the '80s. [[Farida Jalal]] followed suit with two wins in the '90s. [[Jaya Bachchan]] took over in the 2000s with three wins. Until now, no actress is leading the 2010s.\n* [[Vyjayanthimala]] was the first actress to win both Best Actress Award and Best Supporting Actress Award. She was also the first person to refuse a Filmfare Award for her role in ''[[Devdas (1955 film)|Devdas]]'' (1955) which then followed by [[Reena Roy]] for her role in ''[[Apnapan]]'' (1977). Both refused it citing that their roles were leading and not supporting.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hits and misses|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050213/spectrum/main6.htm|newspaper=The Tribune|date=2005-02-13|author=Miglani, Surendra|accessdate=2011-08-08}}</ref>\n* Only once have siblings been nominated for the award during the same year: [[Ratna Pathak]] and [[Supriya Pathak]] in 2011.\n* Fourteen actresses who have won both [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and Best Supporting Actress awards include [[Vyjayanthimala]], [[Raakhee]], [[Padmini Kolhapure]], [[Nutan]], [[Dimple Kapadia]], [[Rekha]], [[Karisma Kapoor]], [[Jaya Bachchan]], [[Madhuri Dixit]], [[Rani Mukerji]], [[Kareena Kapoor]], [[Kangana Ranaut]], [[Priyanka Chopra]] and [[Shabana Azmi]]. Mukerji is the first and only actress to win both these awards in the same year (2005).\n* Two actresses were nominated for both [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and Best Supporting Actress awards for the same performance: [[Nutan]] for ''[[Saudagar (1973 film)|Saudagar]]'' (1974) and for ''[[Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki]]'' (1979) and [[Raakhee]] for ''[[Doosra Aadmi]]'' (1978); Nutan won [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] award for ''[[Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki]]'' (1979).\n* [[Madhuri Dixit]] and [[Rani Mukerji]] are the overall most nominated performers in the female acting categories, with 17 nominations overall. Dixit has 14 for [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and 3 for Best Supporting Actress, while Mukerji has 10 for Best Actress and 7 for Best Supporting Actress.\n* [[Kareena Kapoor]] and [[Priyanka Chopra]] are the only two actresses to win [[Filmfare Awards]] in five different categories, while [[Kangana Ranaut]] has won in four categories. All the three actresses have won [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], Best Supporting Actress and [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut|Best Female Debut]] awards once each. Kapoor won twice, while Chopra and Ranaut won once each in the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress|Best Actress (Critics)]] category. Kapoor and Chopra also won one [[Filmfare Special Award|Special Award]] and one [[Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role|Best Villain Award]], respectively. Kapoor, Chopra and Ranaut, thus have 6, 5 and 4 Filmfare Awards respectively.\n\n===Multiple Winners===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Nirupa Roy 1950.JPG|[[Nirupa Roy]]<br>(3 Wins)\nFarida Jalal.jpg|[[Farida Jalal]]<br>(3 Wins) \nFile:Jaya B Big B\u2019s birthday.jpg|[[Jaya Bachchan]]<br>(3 Wins)\nFile:Rani Mukerji promoting Hichki in 2018 (cropped).jpg|[[Rani Mukerji]]<br>(3 Wins)\nFile:SupriyaPathak.jpg|[[Supriya Pathak]]<br>(3 Wins) \n</gallery>\n\n* '''3 Wins''': [[Nirupa Roy]], [[Farida Jalal]], [[Jaya Bachchan]], [[Rani Mukerji]], [[Supriya Pathak]]\n* '''2 Wins''': [[Shashikala]], [[Simi Garewal]], [[Raakhee]], [[Rohini Hattangadi]], [[Aruna Irani]], [[Konkona Sen Sharma]]\n\n===Multiple Nominees===\n* '''10 Nominations''' : [[Aruna Irani]]\n* '''8 Nominations''' : [[Raakhee]], [[Shashikala]] \n* '''7 Nominations''' : [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]], [[Farida Jalal]], [[Rani Mukerji]]\n* '''6 Nominations''' : [[Rekha]]\n* '''5 Nominations''' : [[Helen (actress)|Helen]], [[Lalita Pawar]], [[Supriya Pathak]]\n\n==List of winners==\n\n===1950s===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align: left;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%;text-align:center;\"| Photos of winners\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;text-align:center;\"| Actor\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;text-align:center;\"| Role(s)\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;text-align:center;\"| Film\n|-\n!

Later on, Ghosh also portrayed Lin, Mohor and Rohon's grown-up daughter. The show also starred Debottam Majumdar, [[Anusuya Majumdar]], Rita Koyral, Sohini Sanyal and Diganta Bagchi in prominent supporting roles.\n\nThe show, that had been penned down by Leena Gangopadhyay, dealt with the heart-touching story of Mohor, a simple village girl having high intellect and a kind heart, who married the modern-day city boy Rohon, and how their relationship worked in the initial phase, and how after many misunderstandings and separation, Rohon realized his love for Mohor. However, Mohor didn't return to him and chose to love Rohon and keep his memory in her mind, but remained separated from him for lifelong. The show also encompassed how Mohor fulfilled her aspirations by becoming a doctor, and served the diseased people with all her effort and dedication, in her humanitarian profession. Later, the series showed how Mohor reunited with her estranged (long-lost) daughter, Lin; completing the heartfelt story of her life-journey.\n\nThroughout its run, ''Binni Dhaner Khoi'' remained one of the leading daily soaps of that time on [[Bengali language|Bengali]]  television, and had been received well widely by the masses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1091206/jsp/graphiti/story_11823329.jsp|title=Small screen, big stars|website=telegraphindia.com|date= 6 December 2009}}</ref> Its time slot has varied over the years, first airing at 8:30 PM, then at the 8:45 PM time slot and finally at 9:00 PM IST. The show went off air in mid-2012.\n\n==Premise==\nThis tale encompasses and reflects the images of laughter and tears, joys and sorrows, trials and tribulations that make up the lives of three generations.\n17-year old Mohor is a simple, bubbly and lively village girl. Her elder sister Gini's marriage is fixed with the modern-day, learned, charming city boy Rohon, but Gini loves someone else and elopes with her lover on the day of her marriage. So, Mohor has to take Gini's place as the bride and thus, marries Rohon at such an early age, without even having the knowledge of marriage. Over the course of their relationship, Mohor matures as a person, develops a loving relationship with Rohon's family members, especially with Rohon's mother and his paternal grandmother, Ana. Mohor later on falls in love with Rohon, who too develops a close bond with Mohor but loves Kurchi instead, his colleague at work. Kurchi gets Mohor and Rohon divorced after many plotting and scheming, and herself becomes Rohon's second wife. However, Rohon soon gets to see the true colours of Kurchi and gets irritated with her, and his love for Kurchi vanishes as well. Instead, Rohon seems to realize his feelings for Mohor to be true love, not mere affection. He tries to reunite with Mohor, but Mohor in a fit of rage refuses him, but also acknowledges her own emotional turmoil for Rohon, though she sticks to her decision. Mohor now totally focuses on her medical studies, after she is given the help and assistance by a genuine good-hearted person, whom later Kurchi falls in love with and subsequently marries, after willingly divorcing Rohon. Mohor passes her medical last year exams with flying colours, becoming an [[M.B.B.S.]] doctor. Meanwhile, a new man, Rishi enters Mohor's life and he develops an unrequited love for Mohor, much to Rohon's chagrin. However, Mohor decides to neither reconnect with Rohon nor to accept Rishi's proposal of marriage and build up her individual existence by serving people as a doctor instead.\n\nRohon falls ill and seeks earnestly for Mohor, who now comes to his aid. One night, Rohon and Mohor get intimate, resulting in Mohor's pregnancy. However, Rohon soon dies from his vulnerable disease. Rishi stands by Mohor in this tough time and also requests Mohor to at least let him fulfill his duty as a friend by taking the responsibility of Mohor's baby. After an emotional confrontation, Ron confesses for the first time that she respects Rishi for what he is, how much important he is in her life and the fact that she loves Rishi, only next to Rohon. Rishi for one last time proposes Mohor to be his life partner, but Mohor, getting very emotional, refuses him once again; and they part ways. Few months later, Mohor gives birth to Rohon's daughter (Lin), but she is separated from Mohor at birth, adding more to her woes.\n\n===Parallel tracks===\nApart from showcasing Mohor's journey, the show also followed the story of some secondary characters, most notably Gini (Mohor's elder sister) and Ana (Rohon's grandmother). Like Mohor, Gini too didn't got true love in life and had to lead her life on her own as well, later on, becoming a primary school teacher. Ana's real name is Anwara Bibi and she was revealed to be a Muslim woman, a fact that was hard to accept for her own parents, in-las and family members. But, with Mohor's help, Ana finally obtained love and respect in her family, despite revealing her actual religion and heredity.\n\n===21 years later===\nThe story takes a \"21 years leap\",<ref name=\"Age is no barrier, feels Monami\">{{cite news|title=Age is no barrier, feels Monami|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/Age-is-no-barrier-feels-Monami/articleshow/13253405.cms|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=19 August 2019|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> as it introduces some new characters, primarily Lin (Mohor and Rohon's grown-up daughter), who returns from [[US]] for conducting an assignment, but incidentally gets to know her roots and her true background. The sprightly Lin falls in love with Bubu (Kurchi's son) and the story deals with how Lin handles her marriage with Bubu amidst chaos and misunderstandings. The story arc also follows Mohor's remaining years of life as she finally reunites with her long-lost daughter, Lin, who also, upon clearing all misunderstandings, accepts Mohor as her mother and loves her form the deep core of heart as well. In the final episodes, it is shown how Mohor rejuvenates her initial days of life, all her quests to achieve stability and how she served the people generously, as she finally dies in peace at 46 years of age, putting an end to her lifelong struggle.\n\n==Cast==\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Monami Ghosh]] as Mohor and Lin\n:#Dr. Kojagori Mukherjee aka ''Mohor'' - Rohon's first wife, Rishi's love interest, Lin's mother.\n:#Lin Banerjee - Mohor and Rohon's daughter, Bubu's wife, Chiru's love interest.\n* [[Manoj Ojha]] as Rohon Banerjee - Mohor's husband, Kurchis' first husband, Lin's father.

The show also encompassed how Mohor fulfilled her aspirations by becoming a doctor, and served the diseased people with all her effort and dedication, in her humanitarian profession. Later, the series showed how Mohor reunited with her estranged (long-lost) daughter, Lin; completing the heartfelt story of her life-journey.\n\nThroughout its run, ''Binni Dhaner Khoi'' remained one of the leading daily soaps of that time on [[Bengali language|Bengali]]  television, and had been received well widely by the masses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1091206/jsp/graphiti/story_11823329.jsp|title=Small screen, big stars|website=telegraphindia.com|date= 6 December 2009}}</ref> Its time slot has varied over the years, first airing at 8:30 PM, then at the 8:45 PM time slot and finally at 9:00 PM IST. The show went off air in mid-2012.\n\n==Premise==\nThis tale encompasses and reflects the images of laughter and tears, joys and sorrows, trials and tribulations that make up the lives of three generations.\n17-year old Mohor is a simple, bubbly and lively village girl. Her elder sister Gini's marriage is fixed with the modern-day, learned, charming city boy Rohon, but Gini loves someone else and elopes with her lover on the day of her marriage. So, Mohor has to take Gini's place as the bride and thus, gets married to Rohon at such an early age, without even having the knowledge of marriage. Over the course of their relationship, Mohor matures as a person, develops a loving relationship with Rohon's family members, especially with Rohon's mother and his paternal grandmother, Ana. Mohor later on falls in love with Rohon, who too develops a close bond with Mohor but loves Kurchi instead, his colleague at work. Kurchi gets Mohor and Rohon divorced after many plotting and scheming, and herself becomes Rohon's second wife. However, Rohon soon gets to see the true colours of Kurchi and gets irritated with her, and his love for Kurchi vanishes as well. Instead, Rohon seems to realize his feelings for Mohor to be true love, not mere affection. He tries to reunite with Mohor, but Mohor in a fit of rage refuses him, but also acknowledges her own emotional turmoil for Rohon, though she sticks to her decision. Mohor now totally focuses on her medical studies, after she is given the help and assistance by a genuine good-hearted person, whom later Kurchi falls in love with and subsequently marries, after willingly divorcing Rohon. Mohor passes her medical last year exams with flying colours, becoming an [[M.B.B.S.]] doctor. Meanwhile, a new man, Rishi enters Mohor's life and he develops an unrequited love for Mohor, much to Rohon's chagrin. However, Mohor decides to neither reconnect with Rohon nor to accept Rishi's proposal of marriage and build up her individual existence by serving people as a doctor instead.\n\nRohon falls ill and seeks earnestly for Mohor, who now comes to his aid. One night, Rohon and Mohor get intimate, resulting in Mohor's pregnancy. However, Rohon soon dies from his vulnerable disease. Rishi stands by Mohor in this tough time and also requests Mohor to at least let him fulfill his duty as a friend by taking the responsibility of Mohor's baby. After an emotional confrontation, Ron confesses for the first time that she respects Rishi for what he is, how much important he is in her life and the fact that she loves Rishi, only next to Rohon. Rishi for one last time proposes Mohor to be his life partner, but Mohor, getting very emotional, refuses him once again; and they part ways. Few months later, Mohor gives birth to Rohon's daughter (Lin), but she is separated from Mohor at birth, adding more to her woes.\n\n===Parallel tracks===\nApart from showcasing Mohor's journey, the show also followed the story of some secondary characters, most notably Gini (Mohor's elder sister) and Ana (Rohon's grandmother). Like Mohor, Gini too didn't got true love in life and had to lead her life on her own as well, later on, becoming a primary school teacher. Ana's real name is Anwara Bibi and she was revealed to be a Muslim woman, a fact that was hard to accept for her own parents, in-las and family members. But, with Mohor's help, Ana finally obtained love and respect in her family, despite revealing her actual religion and heredity.\n\n===21 years later===\nThe story takes a \"21 years leap\",<ref name=\"Age is no barrier, feels Monami\">{{cite news|title=Age is no barrier, feels Monami|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/Age-is-no-barrier-feels-Monami/articleshow/13253405.cms|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=19 August 2019|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> as it introduces some new characters, primarily Lin (Mohor and Rohon's grown-up daughter), who returns from [[US]] for conducting an assignment, but incidentally gets to know her roots and her true background. The sprightly Lin falls in love with Bubu (Kurchi's son) and the story deals with how Lin handles her marriage with Bubu amidst chaos and misunderstandings. The story arc also follows Mohor's remaining years of life as she finally reunites with her long-lost daughter, Lin, who also, upon clearing all misunderstandings, accepts Mohor as her mother and loves her form the deep core of heart as well. In the final episodes, it is shown how Mohor rejuvenates her initial days of life, all her quests to achieve stability and how she served the people generously, as she finally dies in peace at 46 years of age, putting an end to her lifelong struggle.\n\n==Cast==\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Monami Ghosh]] as Mohor and Lin (Double Role)\n:#Dr. Kojagori Mukherjee aka ''Mohor'' - Main Lead, Rohon's first wife, Rishi's love interest, Lin's mother.\n:#Lin Banerjee - New/Second Main Lead, Mohor and Rohon's daughter, Bubu's wife, Chiru's love interest.\n* [[Manoj Ojha]] as Rohon Banerjee - Main Lead, Mohor's husband, Kurchis' first husband, Lin's father.

After being dropped by Verve, the band signed to [[Decca Records]], where they released their most critically acclaimed album, ''[[In the Land of Grey and Pink]]'', in 1971. Dave Sinclair left after the album's release and the group split up the following year. Hastings and Coughlan added new members, notably viola player [[Geoffrey Richardson (musician)|Geoffrey Richardson]], continuing on before splitting in 1978.\n\nThe band reformed several times in the following decades, and Caravan still remain active as a live band in the 21st century, despite Coughlan's death in December 2013.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early career===\nThe group's original members, [[Dave Sinclair (keyboardist)|David Sinclair]], [[Richard Sinclair]], [[Pye Hastings]] and [[Richard Coughlan]] had all been in the Canterbury-based [[Wilde Flowers]], albeit not at the same time. Richard Sinclair had been an early member, but left in September 1965 to study at college.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=61}} Hastings had replaced [[Robert Wyatt]] as the group's singer and Coughlan as drummer in the band when Wyatt, who performed both roles, formed [[Soft Machine]].{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=67}} David Sinclair joined the group in late 1966, but after future Soft Machine member [[Hugh Hopper]] left the group in June the following year, they began to run out of momentum and broke up in October 1967.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=68}}\n\nCoughlan, Hastings and the two Sinclairs subsequently formed Caravan in 1968. \"We all had the same goal\" recalled Richard Sinclair, \"to make our music, write it ourselves, and make a living from it.\"{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=192}} The band rented a house in [[Whitstable]], [[Kent]] for six months, where they began to write and rehearse new material.<ref name=\"greypink_sleeve\"/> They also borrowed Soft Machine's PA for rehearsals while that band was on tour with [[Jimi Hendrix]] in the US, as Caravan did not have enough funds for their own equipment.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=127}} They were forced to leave in June and ended up living in tents and rehearsing in a local church hall.<ref name=\"greypink_sleeve\"/> By October, they had attracted the interest of music publisher Ian Ralfini,<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|4}} who signed them to the American record label, [[Verve Records]], and became the first British act they signed.<ref name=\"greypink_sleeve\">{{cite AV media notes|title=In The Land of Grey and Pink |type=original sleeve notes|publisher=Decca|id=8829832|year=2001|page=7}}</ref> Verve subsequently released the band's debut LP, ''[[Caravan (Caravan album)|Caravan]]'' (1968), later the same year, but a few months later moved out of the UK record business and dropped the band.<ref name=\"ificould\">{{cite AV media notes|title=If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You|first=Mark|last=Powell|publisher=Decca Records|id=8829682|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\nAfter a series of gigs in London, including the [[Speakeasy Club]], the band were introduced to Terry King, who became the group's first manager. [[Dave Hitchcock|David Hitchcock]], who had been working in the art department of [[Decca Records]], asked the company's president, [[Hugh Mendl]] to sign the band.<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|4}} They began recording their second album, ''[[If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You]]'' (1970) in September 1969, while continuing to gig on the university circuit, and appearing at festivals alongside [[Pink Floyd]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[The Nice]] and [[Soft Machine]].<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|5}} Recording ''If I could&nbsp;...'' continued in February 1970, with the 14-minute track \"For Richard\", showing the band's contrast in styles and [[jazz-rock]] influence.<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|7}} The album was released in August, alongside an appearance at the Plumpton Festival with [[Van der Graaf Generator]], Yes and [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]].<ref name=\"greypink\">{{cite AV media notes|title=In The Land of Grey And Pink|first=Mark|last=Powell|publisher=Decca Records|id=882932|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|4}} The accompanying single \"Hello Hello\" helped them land an appearance on the TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', performing the album's title track.<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nCaravan had started to build a live following by mid-1970, including an appearance at the [[Kralingen Music Festival|Kralingen Pop Festival]] in the Netherlands to an audience of 250,000 and the 10th [[Plumpton, East Sussex|Plumpton]] Festival. In autumn 1970, Caravan began working on one of their most critically acclaimed albums, ''[[In the Land of Grey and Pink]]'' (1971). The balance of songwriting changed from the previous two albums, with Richard Sinclair taking a more prominent role. His song, \"Golf Girl\" was originally written about his then girlfriend (and future wife), but the lyrics were rewritten in the final version.<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|8}} The group decided to follow up \"For Richard\" with a suite of short sections of songs written by David Sinclair, that the rest of the band worked on and linked together to form a side-long track, \"Nine Feet Underground\". Although, the track was recorded in five separate stages and spliced together, the band performed the suite live as it was finally presented on the album, and it remained a popular track in their live set.<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|9}} The album was released in April 1971, and though it did not chart, it has remained in print ever since, and has been remastered for CD several times,<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|10}} notably a digital remaster in 2011 by [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-land-of-grey-and-pink-mw0000463611|title=In the Land of Grey and Pink (2011 remaster)|first=Dave|last=Thompson|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref> \"Nine Feet Underground\" in particular was a regular fixture on late-night FM radio during the early 1970s.{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=190}}\n\nDespite the critical success of ''In the Land of Grey and Pink'', the group were disappointed by its lack of commercial success, believing that Decca were not promoting the band properly or investing enough money. In August 1971, David Sinclair accepted a job with former Soft Machine drummer [[Robert Wyatt]]'s new band, [[Matching Mole]]. Reflecting on the decision to leave, Sinclair later said \"I felt the whole thing was going a bit stagnant&nbsp;... I wanted to play with other people, but had to accept that with Caravan it was either all or nothing.\"<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|11}} Hastings remembers that \"Dave's departure was a serious blow.\"<ref name=\"waterloo\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Waterloo Lily|first=Mark|last=Powell|publisher=Decca Records|id=8829822|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\n===Line-up changes===\nThe remaining members continued on together and Richard Sinclair invited keyboardist [[Steve Miller (keyboardist)|Steve Miller]] to join the band.<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|5}} However, it was immediately apparent that the style of the band would be different. Sinclair and Miller wanted to perform more jazz-rock, while Hastings was frustrated that the previous style was being neglected, and that it was \"virtually impossible\" to get Miller to perform in David Sinclair's style.<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|8}} The band started recording a new album, ''[[Waterloo Lily]]'' (1972) in late 1971, which was the first use of orchestral instrumentation, arranged by Hastings and his brother, Jimmy, who had guested on previous albums.<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|9}} The album was released in May 1972, but by this time, musical differences had come to a head, and after a gig with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] in July, the band split. Richard Sinclair later said, \"It didn't quite work with Steve in the band because the music started to go a bit too loose for the way that Pye and Richard Coughlan played.\"<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nHastings and Coughlan decided to continue as Caravan, and the duo recruited [[viola]] player [[Geoffrey Richardson (musician)|Geoffrey Richardson]], bassist Stu Evans and keyboardist Derek Austin and toured extensively. This line-up did not make any recordings before Evans was replaced by [[John G. Perry]] and Dave Sinclair rejoined the group in 1973.<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/>\n\nThe resulting album ''[[For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night]]'' (1973) was a major critical achievement<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/> and showed that the group could survive the loss of co-vocalist Richard Sinclair. Jimmy Hastings reprised his role as orchestrator along with Martyn Ford and John Bell,{{sfn|Hinton|2003|p=171}} while the Soft Machine's [[Mike Ratledge]] contributed an instrumental piece, \"Backwards\" as part of a medley.{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=193}} The group followed this with a live album, ''[[Caravan and the New Symphonia]]'' (1974), including orchestral arrangements by Ford{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=222}} and conducting by Simon Jeffes.{{sfn|Hinton|2003|p=171}}\n\nPerry left after the ''New Symphonia'' and was replaced by [[Mike Wedgwood]] for the album ''[[Cunning Stunts (Caravan album)|Cunning Stunts]]'' (1975), which reached the top 50 in the UK<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/official-albums-chart/ |title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 Caravan \u2013 Cunning Stunts |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=2009-11-04 }}</ref> and was a minor hit in the US, reaching number 124.<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/> It was the last album released on Decca, which preceded a number of other problems in the band.

After being dropped by Verve, the band signed to [[Decca Records]], where they released their most critically acclaimed album, ''[[In the Land of Grey and Pink]]'', in 1971. Dave Sinclair left after the album's release and the group split up the following year. Hastings and Coughlan added new members, notably viola player [[Geoffrey Richardson (musician)|Geoffrey Richardson]], continuing on before splitting in 1978.\n\nThe band reformed several times in the following decades, and Caravan still remain active as a live band in the 21st century, despite Coughlan's death in December 2013.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early career===\nThe group's original members, [[Dave Sinclair (keyboardist)|David Sinclair]], [[Richard Sinclair]], [[Pye Hastings]] and [[Richard Coughlan]] had all been in the Canterbury-based [[Wilde Flowers]], albeit not at the same time. Richard Sinclair had been an early member, but left in September 1965 to study at college.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=61}} Hastings had replaced [[Robert Wyatt]] as the group's singer and Coughlan as drummer in the band when Wyatt, who performed both roles, formed [[Soft Machine]].{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=67}} David Sinclair joined the group in late 1966, but after future Soft Machine member [[Hugh Hopper]] left the group in June the following year, they began to run out of momentum and broke up in October 1967.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=68}}\n\nCoughlan, Hastings and the two Sinclairs subsequently formed Caravan in 1968. \"We all had the same goal\" recalled Richard Sinclair, \"to make our music, write it ourselves, and make a living from it.\"{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=192}} The band rented a house in [[Whitstable]], [[Kent]] for six months, where they began to write and rehearse new material.<ref name=\"greypink_sleeve\"/> They also borrowed Soft Machine's PA for rehearsals while that band was on tour with [[Jimi Hendrix]] in the US, as Caravan did not have enough funds for their own equipment.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=127}} They were forced to leave in June and ended up living in tents and rehearsing in a local church hall.<ref name=\"greypink_sleeve\"/> By October, they had attracted the interest of music publisher Ian Ralfini,<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|4}} who signed them to the American record label, [[Verve Records]], and became the first British act they signed.<ref name=\"greypink_sleeve\">{{cite AV media notes|title=In The Land of Grey and Pink |type=original sleeve notes|publisher=Decca|id=8829832|year=2001|page=7}}</ref> Verve subsequently released the band's debut LP, ''[[Caravan (Caravan album)|Caravan]]'' (1968), later the same year, but a few months later moved out of the UK record business and dropped the band.<ref name=\"ificould\">{{cite AV media notes|title=If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You|first=Mark|last=Powell|publisher=Decca Records|id=8829682|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\nAfter a series of gigs in London, including the [[Speakeasy Club]], the band were introduced to Terry King, who became the group's first manager. [[Dave Hitchcock|David Hitchcock]], who had been working in the art department of [[Decca Records]], asked the company's president, [[Hugh Mendl]] to sign the band.<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|4}} They began recording their second album, ''[[If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You]]'' (1970) in September 1969, while continuing to gig on the university circuit, and appearing at festivals alongside [[Pink Floyd]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[The Nice]] and [[Soft Machine]].<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|5}} Recording ''If I could&nbsp;...'' continued in February 1970, with the 14-minute track \"For Richard\", showing the band's contrast in styles and [[jazz-rock]] influence.<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|7}} The album was released in August, alongside an appearance at the Plumpton Festival with [[Van der Graaf Generator]], Yes and [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]].<ref name=\"greypink\">{{cite AV media notes|title=In The Land of Grey And Pink|first=Mark|last=Powell|publisher=Decca Records|id=882932|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|4}} The accompanying single \"Hello Hello\" helped them land an appearance on the TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', performing the album's title track.<ref name=\"ificould\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nCaravan had started to build a live following by mid-1970, including an appearance at the [[Kralingen Music Festival|Kralingen Pop Festival]] in the Netherlands to an audience of 250,000 and the 10th [[Plumpton, East Sussex|Plumpton]] Festival. In autumn 1970, Caravan began working on one of their most critically acclaimed albums, ''[[In the Land of Grey and Pink]]'' (1971). The balance of songwriting changed from the previous two albums, with Richard Sinclair taking a more prominent role. His song, \"Golf Girl\" was originally written about his then girlfriend (and future wife), but the lyrics were rewritten in the final version.<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|8}} The group decided to follow up \"For Richard\" with a suite of short sections of songs written by David Sinclair, that the rest of the band worked on and linked together to form a side-long track, \"Nine Feet Underground\". Although, the track was recorded in five separate stages and spliced together, the band performed the suite live as it was finally presented on the album, and it remained a popular track in their live set.<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|9}} The album was released in April 1971, and though it did not chart, it has remained in print ever since, and has been remastered for CD several times,<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|10}} notably a digital remaster in 2011 by [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-land-of-grey-and-pink-mw0000463611|title=In the Land of Grey and Pink (2011 remaster)|first=Dave|last=Thompson|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref> \"Nine Feet Underground\" in particular was a regular fixture on late-night FM radio during the early 1970s.{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=190}}\n\nDespite the critical success of ''In the Land of Grey and Pink'', the group were disappointed by its lack of commercial success, believing that Decca were not promoting the band properly or investing enough money. In August 1971, David Sinclair accepted a job with former Soft Machine drummer [[Robert Wyatt]]'s new band, [[Matching Mole]]. Reflecting on the decision to leave, Sinclair later said \"I felt the whole thing was going a bit stagnant&nbsp;... I wanted to play with other people, but had to accept that with Caravan it was either all or nothing.\"<ref name=\"greypink\"/>{{rp|11}} Hastings remembers that \"Dave's departure was a serious blow.\"<ref name=\"waterloo\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Waterloo Lily|first=Mark|last=Powell|publisher=Decca Records|id=8829822|year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\n===Line-up changes===\nThe remaining members continued on together and Richard Sinclair invited keyboardist [[Steve Miller (keyboardist)|Steve Miller]] to join the band.<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|5}} However, it was immediately apparent that the style of the band would be different. Sinclair and Miller wanted to perform more jazz-rock, while Hastings was frustrated that the previous style was being neglected, and that it was \"virtually impossible\" to get Miller to perform in David Sinclair's style.<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|8}} The band started recording a new album, ''[[Waterloo Lily]]'' (1972) in late 1971, which was the first use of orchestral instrumentation, arranged by Hastings and his brother, Jimmy, who had guested on previous albums.<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|9}} The album was released in May 1972, but by this time, musical differences had come to a head, and after a gig with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] in July, the band split. Richard Sinclair later said, \"It didn't quite work with Steve in the band because the music started to go a bit too loose for the way that Pye and Richard Coughlan played.\"<ref name=\"waterloo\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nHastings and Coughlan decided to continue as Caravan, and the duo recruited [[viola]] player [[Geoffrey Richardson (musician)|Geoffrey Richardson]], bassist Stu Evans and keyboardist Derek Austin and toured extensively. This line-up did not make any recordings before Evans was replaced by [[John G. Perry]] and Dave Sinclair rejoined the group in 1973.<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/>\n\nThe resulting album ''[[For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night]]'' (1973) was a major critical achievement<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/> and showed that the group could survive the loss of co-vocalist Richard Sinclair. Jimmy Hastings reprised his role as orchestrator along with Martyn Ford and John Bell,{{sfn|Hinton|2003|p=171}} while the Soft Machine's [[Mike Ratledge]] contributed an instrumental piece, \"Backwards\" as part of a medley.{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=193}} The group followed this with a live album, ''[[Caravan and the New Symphonia]]'' (1974), including orchestral arrangements by Ford{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=222}} and conducting by Simon Jeffes.{{sfn|Hinton|2003|p=171}}\n\nPerry left after the ''New Symphonia'' and was replaced by [[Mike Wedgwood]] for the album ''[[Cunning Stunts (Caravan album)|Cunning Stunts]]'' (1975), which reached the top 50 in the UK<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/official-albums-chart/ |title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 Caravan \u2013 Cunning Stunts |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=2009-11-04 }}</ref> and was a minor hit in the US, reaching number 124.<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/> It was the last album released on Decca, which preceded a number of other problems in the band. David Sinclair left after the album was recorded and was replaced by [[Jan Schelhaas]], with the band's sound becoming more mainstream.{{sfn|Hinton|2003|p=171}} The group signed to [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]]'s BTM Records<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/> and recorded ''[[Blind Dog at St. Dunstans]]'' (1976) which was another minor album hit,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/official-albums-chart/ |title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 Caravan \u2013 Blind Dog At St Dunstan's |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=2009-11-04 }}</ref> but by this point the group were out of step with the prevailing musical trends, and after a final album, ''[[Better by Far]]'' (1977) on [[Arista Records]],<ref name=\"AMGBio\"/> the group split.{{sfn|Hinton|2003|p=171}}\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:PyeHastingsBC.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pye Hastings performing with Caravan at the High Voltage Festival in 2011]]\nCaravan were largely dormant in the 1980s until a 1990 reunion, planned as a one-off for television, reinvigorated their career.{{sfn|Hinton|2003|p=171}} The group continued to tour in the early 1990s, before Richard Sinclair left.

He was an artist of [[Rabindra Sangeet]]. He won two [[National Film Awards|National awards]] for the category [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer|best male playback singer]].\n\n==Early life==\nHemanta was born in [[Varanasi]], in the house of his maternal grandfather who was a leading physician. From the paternal side his family originated from [[Baharu]]. They migrated to [[Kolkata]] in the early 1900s. Hemanta grew up there and attended Nasiruddin School and later [[Mitra Institution]] school of [[Bhawanipore]] area. There he met his longtime friend [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (poet)|Subhas Mukhopadhyay]] who later became a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] poet. During this time, he developed a friendship with the noted writer [[Santosh Kumar Ghosh]]. At that time, Hemanta wrote short stories, Santosh Kumar wrote poems and Subhash Mukhopadhyay sang songs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter passing the intermediate examinations (12th grade), Hemanta joined [[Jadavpur University|Bengal Technical Institute]] at [[Jadavpur]] to pursue Engineering. However, he quit academics to pursue a career in music, despite objection from his father. He briefly tried literature and published a short story in the prestigious Bengali magazine called ''[[Desh (magazine)|Desh]]'', but by the late-1930s he was committed entirely to music.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Early music career==\nUnder the influence of his friend Subhas Mukhopadhyay, Hemanta recorded his first song for [[All India Radio]] in 1935. The first line of the song was \"Amar Ganete Ele Nabarupi Chirantanii.\" Hemanta's music career was primarily mentored by the Bengali musician, [[Sailesh Duttagupta]]. In his early life Hemanta used to follow the famous Bengali singer [[Pankaj Mullick]]. For this he was nicknamed as \"Chhoto Pankaj\". In an interview on television in the early 1980s, Hemanta had mentioned that he had also received classical music training from [[Ustad Faiyaz Khan]]'s student [[Phanibhusan Banerjee]], but his tutelage was cut short by the Ustad's untimely death.\n\nIn 1937, Hemanta cut his first gramophone disc under the Columbia label. The songs (non-film) on this disc were \"Janite Jadi Go Tumi\" and \"Balo Go Balo More\" whose lyrics were by Naresh Bhattacharya and music was composed by Sailesh Duttagupta. Thereafter, every year Hemanta continued to record non-film discs for the [[Gramophone Company of India]] (GCI) till 1984. His first Hindi songs were \"Kitana Dukh Bhulaya Tumne\" and \"O Preet Nibhanewali\", released in 1940 under GCI's Columbia label. Music for these songs were composed by [[Kamal Dasgupta]]; lyrics were by [[Faiyaz Hashmi]].\n\nHemanta's first film song was in the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film]] ''[[Nimai Sanyas]]'' released in 1941. Music was scored by Hariprasanna Das. Hemanta's first compositions for himself were the Bengali non-film songs \"Katha Kayonako Shudhu Shono\" and \"Amar Biraha Akashe Priya\" in 1944. Lyrics were by Amiya Bagchi.His first Hindi film songs were in ''[[Irada (1944 film)]]'' in 1944 under Pt. Amarnath's music direction. \nHemanta is considered the foremost exponent of [[Rabindra Sangeet]]. His first recorded Rabindra Sangeet was in the Bengali film ''[[Priya Bandhabi]]'' (1944).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171205182037/http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/discography/tagore.html Tagore Songs by Hemanta Mukherjee]. faculty.ist.unomaha.edu</ref> The song was \"Pather Sesh Kothaye\". He recorded his first non-film Rabindra Sangeet disc in 1944 under the Columbia label. The songs were \"Aamar Aar Habe Na Deri\" and \"Keno Pantha E Chanchalata\". Prior to that he had recorded the song \" '' Aamaar mallikabone '' \" in All India Radio/Akashvani but, unfortunately, the record has passed into oblivion.<ref>Debashis Dasgupta, ''Desh'', Bengali weekly magazine from [[Anandabazar Patrika]] Ltd., Calcutta, 11 November 1989. P. 36</ref><!-- The songs were ''prangane mor shirishh shakhay'' and ''he nirupama''.]] {{fact|date=June 2009}} -->\n\nHis first movie as a [[music director]] was the Bengali film ''[[Abhiyatri]]'' in 1947. Although many of the songs Hemanta recorded during this time received critical acclaim, major commercial success eluded him until 1947. Some contemporary male singers of Hemanta in Bengali were [[Jaganmay Mitra]], [[Robin Majumdar]], [[Satya Chowdhury]], [[Dhananjay Bhattacharya]], [[Sudhirlal Chakraborty]], [[Bechu Dutta]]<ref>S.

His elder brother, Tarajyoti, was a short-story writer in Bengali. The youngest brother, [[Amal Mukherjee]], composed music as well as sang (Ehy Prithibithey Sharita Jibon) for some Bengali movies, most notably ''Hospital'' and ''[[Abak Prithibi]]''. He recorded a few Bengali songs in the 1960s and also composed music for one of the most memorable renditions \u2013 \" ''Jiboner Anekta Path Eklai..''\" \u2013 of Hemanta<ref>[http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/discography/filmlist1.html Mostly complete discography]</ref><!-- {{fact|date=June 2009}} -->\n\nIn 1945, Hemanta married [[Bela Mukherjee]] (died 25 June 2009),<ref name=toi>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Singer passes away |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-26/kolkata/28201327_1_hunger-strike-sourav-school-school-project |work=[[The Times of India]] |publisher= |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> a singer from [[Bengal]]. Although Bela had sung some popular songs in the movie, ''Kashinath'' (1943), with music by [[Pankaj Mullick]], she did not actively pursue her musical career after marriage. They had two children: a son, Jayant, and a daughter, Ranu. Ranu as [[Ranu Mukhopadhyay]] pursued a music career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with somewhat limited success. Jayant is married to [[Moushumi Chatterjee]], an Indian film actress who was popular in the 1970s.\n\n==Success and migration to Mumbai==\nIn the mid-1940s, Hemanta became an active member of the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA) and started an association with another active IPTA member \u2014 songwriter and composer [[Salil Chowdhury]]. One of the main driving forces behind the establishment of IPTA was the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and the inaction of the British administration and wealthy Indians to prevent it.\n\nIn 1947, Hemanta recorded a non-film song called \"Ganyer badhu\" (\"The rural bride\") that had music and lyrics by Salil Chowdhury. The six-minute song recorded on two sides of a 78 rpm disc was sung at a varying pace and lacked the conventional structure and romantic theme of a Bengali song. It depicted an idyllic, prosperous and caring rural woman's life and family and how it gets ravaged by the demons of famine and ensuing poverty. This song generated an unforeseen popularity for Hemanta and Salil in eastern India and, in a way, established Hemanta ahead of his male contemporaries. Hemanta and Salil paired again in several songs over the next few years. Almost all these songs proved to be very popular.<ref>[http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/articles/salilobi.html Salil Chowdhury's obituary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAround the same period, Hemanta started receiving more assignments for music composition for Bengali films. Some were for director [[Hemen Gupta]]. When Hemen moved to [[Mumbai]] a few years later, he called upon Hemanta to compose music for his first directorial venture in Hindi titled ''Anandmath'' under the [[Filmistan]] banner. Responding to this call, Hemanta migrated to Mumbai in 1951 and joined Filmistan Studios. The music of ''[[Anand Math]]'' (1952) was a moderate success. Perhaps, the most notable songs from this movie is 'Vande mataram' sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]], which Hemanta set to a marching tune. Following ''Anandamath'', Hemanta scored music for a few Filmistan movies like ''Shart'' in subsequent years, the songs of which received moderate popularity. Simultaneously, Hemanta gained popularity in Mumbai as a [[playback singer]].<ref>[http://www.screenindia.com/old/fullstory.php?content_id=17266 Hemant Kumar: That velvet touch ]</ref> His songs playbacked for actor [[Dev Anand]] under music director [[Sachin Dev Burman]] in movies like ''[[Jaal (1952 film)|Jaal]]'' (\"''Yeh raat, yeh chandni phir kahan ... ''\"), ''House No. 44'' (\"''Chup hai dharti, chup hai chand sitare... ''\"), ''[[Solva Saal]]'' (\"''Hai apna dil to awara ..... ''\"),  '' Funtoosh '' (\"''Teri duniya mein jeene se ... ''\"), and ''Baat ek raat ki'' (\"''Na tum hame jaano ..... ''\"),  became very popular and continues to be so. In the 1950s, he also play-backed for other heroes of Hindi films like Pradip Kumar (''Nagin'', ''Detective'') and Sunil Dutt (''Duniya Jhukti Hain'') and later in the 1960s for Biswajeet (''Bees saal Baad'', ''Bin Badal Barsat'', ''Kohra'') and Dharmandra (''Anupama''); he was the music composer for all these films.\n\n==Career rise==\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Hemanta had consolidated his position as a prominent singer and composer. In Bengal, he was one of the foremost exponents of [[Rabindra Sangeet]] and perhaps the most sought-after male singer. In a ceremony organised by Hemanta Mukherjee to honour Debabrata Biswas (1911\u20131980), the legendary Rabindra Sangeet exponent, in Calcutta in March 1980, Debabrata Biswas unhesitatingly mentioned Hemanta as \"the second hero\" to popularise Rabindra Sangeet, the first being the legendary Pankaj Kumar Mallick. In Mumbai, along with playback singing, Hemanta carved a niche as a composer. He composed music for a Hindi film called ''[[Nagin (1954 film)|Nagin]]'' (1954) which became a major success owing largely to its music. Songs of Nagin remained chart-toppers continuously for two years and culminated in Hemant receiving the prestigious [[Filmfare Best Music Director Award]] in 1955. The very same year, he scored music for a Bengali movie called ''Shapmochan'' in which he played back four songs for the Bengali actor [[Uttam Kumar]]. This started a long partnership between Hemant and Uttam as a playback singer-actor pair. They were the most popular singer-actor duo in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]] over the next decade.\n\nIn the latter part of the 1950s, Hemanta composed music and sang for several Bengali and Hindi films, recorded several Rabindra Sangeet and Bengali non-film songs. Almost all of these, especially his Bengali songs, became very popular. This period can be seen as the zenith of his career and lasted for almost a decade. He sang songs composed by the major music directors in Bengal such as [[Nachiketa Ghosh]], [[Robin Chatterjee]] and [[Salil Chowdhury]]. Some of the notable films Hemanta himself composed music for during this period include ''[[Harano Sur]]'', ''[[Marutirtha Hinglaj]]'', ''[[Neel Akasher Neechey]]'', ''[[Lukochuri]]'', ''Swaralipi'', ''[[Deep Jwele Jaai]]'', ''[[Shesh Parjanta]]'', ''Kuhak'', ''Dui Bhai'', and ''[[Saptapadi (1961 film)|Saptapadi]]'' in Bengali, and, ''[[Jagriti]]'' and ''[[Ek Hi Raasta (1956 film)|Ek Hi Raasta]]'' in Hindi.\n\n==Movie production==\n\nIn the late 1950s, Hemanta ventured into [[movie production]] under his own banner: Hemanta-Bela productions. The first movie under this banner was a Bengali film directed by [[Mrinal Sen]], titled ''[[Neel Akasher Neechey]]'' (1959). The story was based on the travails of a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] street hawker in Calcutta in the backdrop of [[India's freedom struggle]]. The movie went on to win the [[President's Gold Medal]] \u2014 the highest honour for a movie from [[Government of India]]. In the next decade, Hemanta's production company was renamed Geetanjali productions and it produced several Hindi movies such as ''[[Bees Saal Baad (1962 film)|Bees Saal Baad]]'', ''Kohraa'', ''Biwi Aur Makaan'', ''Faraar'', ''Rahgir'' and ''[[Khamoshi (1970 film)|Khamoshi]]'' \u2014 all of which had music by Hemanta. Only ''Bees Saal Baad'' and ''Khamoshi'' were major commercial successes.\n\nBack in Bengal, Hemanta scored music for a movie titled ''Palatak'' in 1963 where he experimented with merging [[Bengal folk music]] and light music. This proved to be a major success and Hemanta's composition style changed noticeably for many of his future films in Bengal such as ''Baghini'', and ''[[Balika Badhu (1967 film)|Balika Badhu]]''. In Bengali films ''Manihar'' and ''Adwitiya'', both of which were major musical as well as commercial successes, his compositions had a light classical tinge. In 1961, for commemorating [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s birth centenary, Gramophone company of India featured Rabindrasangeet by Hemanta in a large portion of its commemorative output. This too proved to be a major commercial success. Hemanta went on several overseas concert tours including his trip to the [[West Indies]]. Overall, in the 1960s decade he retained his position as the major male singer in Bengal and as a composer and singer to be reckoned with in Hindi films.\n\nIn the 1960s he was the predominant and lead male voice in many of Tagore's musical dramas like ''Valmiki Pratibha'', ''Shyama'', ''Sapmochan'', ''Chitrangada'' and ''Chandalika''. With Kanika Bandopadhyay (1924\u20132000) and Suchitra Mitra (1924\u20132010), who were the lead female voices in these, he was part of the [[Rabindra Sangeet]] triumvirate that was popular and respected. It was referred as 'Hemanta-Kanika-Suchitra' and, with Debabrata Biswas, this quartet was and continues to be the mostly heard exponents of Tagore compositions. Asoktaru Bandopadhyay, [[Chinmoy Chattopadhyay]], [[Sagar Sen]], Sumitra Sen and Ritu Guha were the other leading exponents of Rabindra Sangeet at that time.\n\n==Later career==\n\nIn the 1970s, Hemanta's contribution in Hindi films was nominal. He scored music for a handful of his home productions, but none of these movies were successful nor their music. In Bengal, however, he remained the foremost exponent of Rabindra Sangeet, film and non-film songs. His output continued to be popular for most of the decade. Some of them are '' Jodi jante chao tumi...'' (1972), '' Ek gochha rajanigandha '', '' Aamay prasno kore nil dhrubatara...'', Sedin tomay dekhechilam...'' (1974), ''Khirki theke singho duar...'' (''Stree'', 1971), ''Ke jane ko ghonta...'' (''Sonar Khancha, 1974), '' Jeona daraon bandhu...'' (''Phuleswari'', 1975 ) and popularised Rabindra sangeet using them beautifully in films as per situations. A very popular and classic example is the song  ''Chorono dhorite diyogo amare..'' in ''Dadar Kirti'' (1980). In 1971, Hemanta debuted as a [[film director]] in for his self-produced Bengali movie ''Anindita''. It didn't fare exceedingly well at the box office. However, his rendition ''Diner seshe ghumer deshe..'' was one of his best and popular Rabindra Sangeet renditions . In the same year Hemanta went to Hollywood by responding to famous film director Conrad Rooks and score the music of Conrad's ''Siddhartha'' and played back [ ''O Nadire...'' ( composed and sang by him earlier in '' Neel Aakaser Niche '')] in that film. He was the first Indian singer to play back in Hollywood. The US government honoured Hemanta by conferring him with the citizenship of Baltimore, Maryland; the first ever singer of India to get USA citizenship. In the early to mid-1970s, two major music composers in Bengal, [[Nachiketa Ghosh]]  and [[Robin Chatterjee]], who had worked closely with Hemanta, since the early 1950s, died. Simultaneously, music composed by Hemanta for Bengali films like ''Phuleswari'', ''Raag Anurag'', \" Ganadebata \" and ''[[Dadar Kirti]]'' established him as the major film music composer in the Bengal movie scene. In 1979, Hemanta re-recorded some of his earlier works with composer [[Salil Chowdhury]] from the 1940s and 1950s. This album, titled ''Legend of Glory, vol. 2'' was a major commercial success, despite Hemanta's aged and slightly tired voice.\n\nIn 1980, Hemanta had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] that severely affected his vocal capabilities, especially his breath control. He continued to record songs in the early eighties, but his voice was a shade of its rich [[baritone]] past. In 1984, Hemanta was felicitated by different organizations, most notably by the Gramophone Company of India, for completing 50 years in music. That very year Hemanta released his last album with Gramophone Company of India \u2014 a 45 rpm extended play disc with four non-film songs. Over the next few years, Hemanta released few non-film songs for small-time companies that had cropped up in the nascent cassette-based music industry. Only a few of these were commercially successful. He composed music for a handful of Bengali movies and one Bengali and one Hindi tele-series. However, by this time he had become an institution, a beloved and revered personality who was a courteous and friendly gentleman. His philanthropic activities included running a homeopathic hospital in memory of his late father in their native village in Baharu, in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. He continued to feature regularly on [[All India Radio]], [[Doordarshan]] (TV) and live programmes/concerts during this period.\n\nIn a television interview, recorded in the early 1990s, to noted elocutionist Gauri Ghosh, his wife Bela Mukherjee recalled that she never knew during his lifetime the number of families and persons he helped to put up financially or otherwise; only after his departure that this truth gradually unveiled.\n \nIn 1987, he was nominated for Padmabhushan which he refused politely, having already turned down a previous offer to receive Padmashree in the 1970s. In this year, he was publicly felicitated in Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta for completing 50 years in musical journey, where, Lata Mangeshkar presented him with the memento on behalf of his fans and admirers. Despite his ageing voice, he became the Best Male Singer in 1988 for his rendition in the film \"Lalan Fakir\".\n\nIn September 1989 he travelled to [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] to receive the [[Michael Madhusudan Award]], as well as to perform a concert. Immediately after returning from this trip he suffered another heart attack on 26 September and died at 11:15 pm in a nursing home in South Calcutta.\n\n==Legacy==\nNearly two decades after his death the Gramophone Company of India releases at least one album by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay every year, repackaging his older songs, because of the commercial viability of his songs. His legacy still lives on through the songs he has recorded, music he has composed, and through many male singers in Bengal and the rest of India who continue to imitate/emulate his singing style.\n\n==Awards==\n* 1956: [[Filmfare Best Music Director Award]]: ''[[Nagin (1954 film)|Nagin]]''\n* 1971: [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer]]: ''Nimantran''\n* 1986: [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer]]: ''Lalan Fakir''\n* 1962:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Swaralipi\":Won\n* 1963:BFJA Best Music Director Award (Hindi): \"Bees Saal Baad\":Won\n*1964:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Palatak\":Won\n*1967:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Minihar\":Won\n*1968:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Balika Badhu\":Won\n*1975:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Phuleawari\":Won\n*1986:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Bhalobasa Bhalobasa\":Won\n*1987:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Pathbhola\":Won\n*1988:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Aagoman\":Won\n* 1972: BFJA Best Male Playback Singer Award: ''Dhannyee Meye'': Won\n* 1975: BFJA Best Male Playback Singer Award: ''Phuleswari'': Won\n* 1976: BFJA Best Male Playback Singer Award: ''Priya Bandhobi'': Won\n* 1985: Honorary D.Litt. by [[Visva-Bharati University]]\n* 1986: [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]]\n* 1989: Michael Madhusudan Award\n\n==Filmography as a composer==\n\n===English filmography as a composer===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

He was an artist of [[Rabindra Sangeet]]. He won two [[National Film Awards|National awards]] for the category [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer|best male playback singer]].\n\n==Early life==\nHemanta was born in [[Varanasi]], in the house of his maternal grandfather who was a leading physician. From the paternal side his family originated from [[Baharu]]. They migrated to [[Kolkata]] in the early 1900s. Hemanta grew up there and attended Nasiruddin School and later [[Mitra Institution]] school of [[Bhawanipore]] area. There he met his longtime friend [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (poet)|Subhas Mukhopadhyay]] who later became a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] poet. During this time, he developed a friendship with the noted writer [[Santosh Kumar Ghosh]]. At that time, Hemanta wrote short stories, Santosh Kumar wrote poems and Subhash Mukhopadhyay sang songs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAfter passing the intermediate examinations (12th grade), Hemanta joined [[Jadavpur University|Bengal Technical Institute]] at [[Jadavpur]] to pursue Engineering. However, he quit academics to pursue a career in music, despite objection from his father. He briefly tried literature and published a short story in the prestigious Bengali magazine called ''[[Desh (magazine)|Desh]]'', but by the late-1930s he was committed entirely to music.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Early music career==\nUnder the influence of his friend Subhas Mukhopadhyay, Hemanta recorded his first song for [[All India Radio]] in 1935. The first line of the song was \"Amar Ganete Ele Nabarupi Chirantanii.\" Hemanta's music career was primarily mentored by the Bengali musician, [[Sailesh Duttagupta]]. In his early life Hemanta used to follow the famous Bengali singer [[Pankaj Mullick]]. For this he was nicknamed as \"Chhoto Pankaj\". In an interview on television in the early 1980s, Hemanta had mentioned that he had also received classical music training from [[Ustad Faiyaz Khan]]'s student [[Phanibhusan Banerjee]], but his tutelage was cut short by the Ustad's untimely death.\n\nIn 1937, Hemanta cut his first gramophone disc under the Columbia label. The songs (non-film) on this disc were \"Janite Jadi Go Tumi\" and \"Balo Go Balo More\" whose lyrics were by Naresh Bhattacharya and music was composed by Sailesh Duttagupta. Thereafter, every year Hemanta continued to record non-film discs for the [[Gramophone Company of India]] (GCI) till 1984. His first Hindi songs were \"Kitana Dukh Bhulaya Tumne\" and \"O Preet Nibhanewali\", released in 1940 under GCI's Columbia label. Music for these songs were composed by [[Kamal Dasgupta]]; lyrics were by [[Faiyaz Hashmi]].\n\nHemanta's first film song was in the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film]] ''[[Nimai Sanyas]]'' released in 1941. Music was scored by Hariprasanna Das. Hemanta's first compositions for himself were the Bengali non-film songs \"Katha Kayonako Shudhu Shono\" and \"Amar Biraha Akashe Priya\" in 1944. Lyrics were by Amiya Bagchi.His first Hindi film songs were in ''[[Irada (1944 film)]]'' in 1944 under Pt. Amarnath's music direction. \nHemanta is considered the foremost exponent of [[Rabindra Sangeet]]. His first recorded Rabindra Sangeet was in the Bengali film ''[[Priya Bandhabi]]'' (1944).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171205182037/http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/discography/tagore.html Tagore Songs by Hemanta Mukherjee]. faculty.ist.unomaha.edu</ref> The song was \"Pather Sesh Kothaye\". He recorded his first non-film Rabindra Sangeet disc in 1944 under the Columbia label. The songs were \"Aamar Aar Habe Na Deri\" and \"Keno Pantha E Chanchalata\". Prior to that he had recorded the song \" '' Aamaar mallikabone '' \" in All India Radio/Akashvani but, unfortunately, the record has passed into oblivion.<ref>Debashis Dasgupta, ''Desh'', Bengali weekly magazine from [[Anandabazar Patrika]] Ltd., Calcutta, 11 November 1989. P. 36</ref><!-- The songs were ''prangane mor shirishh shakhay'' and ''he nirupama''.]] {{fact|date=June 2009}} -->\n\nHis first movie as a [[music director]] was the Bengali film ''[[Abhiyatri]]'' in 1947. Although many of the songs Hemanta recorded during this time received critical acclaim, major commercial success eluded him until 1947. Some contemporary male singers of Hemanta in Bengali were [[Jaganmay Mitra]], [[Robin Majumdar]], [[Satya Chowdhury]], [[Dhananjay Bhattacharya]], [[Sudhirlal Chakraborty]], [[Bechu Dutta]]<ref>S. Bhattacharya, ''Amar gaaner swaralipi'', A. Mukherjee Press, Calcutta, 1988. Pp. 82,83,84</ref> and [[Talat Mahmood]].<!-- {{fact|date=June 2009}} -->\n\n==Family==\nHemanta had three brothers and a sister, Nilima. His elder brother, Tarajyoti, was a short-story writer in Bengali. The youngest brother, [[Amal Mukherjee]], composed music as well as sang (Ehy Prithibithey Sharita Jibon) for some Bengali movies, most notably ''Hospital'' and ''[[Abak Prithibi]]''. He recorded a few Bengali songs in the 1960s and also composed music for one of the most memorable renditions \u2013 \" ''Jiboner Anekta Path Eklai..''\" \u2013 of Hemanta<ref>[http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/discography/filmlist1.html Mostly complete discography]</ref><!-- {{fact|date=June 2009}} -->\n\nIn 1945, Hemanta married [[Bela Mukherjee]] (died 25 June 2009),<ref name=toi>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Singer passes away |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-26/kolkata/28201327_1_hunger-strike-sourav-school-school-project |work=[[The Times of India]] |publisher= |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> a singer from [[Bengal]]. Although Bela had sung some popular songs in the movie, ''Kashinath'' (1943), with music by [[Pankaj Mullick]], she did not actively pursue her musical career after marriage. They had two children: a son, Jayant, and a daughter, Ranu. Ranu as [[Ranu Mukhopadhyay]] pursued a music career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with somewhat limited success. Jayant is married to [[Moushumi Chatterjee]], an Indian film actress who was popular in the 1970s.\n\n==Success and migration to Mumbai==\nIn the mid-1940s, Hemanta became an active member of the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA) and started an association with another active IPTA member \u2014 songwriter and composer [[Salil Chowdhury]]. One of the main driving forces behind the establishment of IPTA was the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and the inaction of the British administration and wealthy Indians to prevent it.\n\nIn 1947, Hemanta recorded a non-film song called \"Ganyer badhu\" (\"The rural bride\") that had music and lyrics by Salil Chowdhury. The six-minute song recorded on two sides of a 78 rpm disc was sung at a varying pace and lacked the conventional structure and romantic theme of a Bengali song. It depicted an idyllic, prosperous and caring rural woman's life and family and how it gets ravaged by the demons of famine and ensuing poverty. This song generated an unforeseen popularity for Hemanta and Salil in eastern India and, in a way, established Hemanta ahead of his male contemporaries. Hemanta and Salil paired again in several songs over the next few years. Almost all these songs proved to be very popular.<ref>[http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/articles/salilobi.html Salil Chowdhury's obituary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAround the same period, Hemanta started receiving more assignments for music composition for Bengali films. Some were for director [[Hemen Gupta]]. When Hemen moved to [[Mumbai]] a few years later, he called upon Hemanta to compose music for his first directorial venture in Hindi titled ''Anandmath'' under the [[Filmistan]] banner. Responding to this call, Hemanta migrated to Mumbai in 1951 and joined Filmistan Studios. The music of ''[[Anand Math]]'' (1952) was a moderate success. Perhaps, the most notable songs from this movie is 'Vande mataram' sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]], which Hemanta set to a marching tune. Following ''Anandamath'', Hemanta scored music for a few Filmistan movies like ''Shart'' in subsequent years, the songs of which received moderate popularity. Simultaneously, Hemanta gained popularity in Mumbai as a [[playback singer]].<ref>[http://www.screenindia.com/old/fullstory.php?content_id=17266 Hemant Kumar: That velvet touch ]</ref> His songs playbacked for actor [[Dev Anand]] under music director [[Sachin Dev Burman]] in movies like ''[[Jaal (1952 film)|Jaal]]'' (\"''Yeh raat, yeh chandni phir kahan ... ''\"), ''House No. 44'' (\"''Chup hai dharti, chup hai chand sitare... ''\"), ''[[Solva Saal]]'' (\"''Hai apna dil to awara ..... ''\"),  '' Funtoosh '' (\"''Teri duniya mein jeene se ... ''\"), and ''Baat ek raat ki'' (\"''Na tum hame jaano ..... ''\"),  became very popular and continues to be so. In the 1950s, he also play-backed for other heroes of Hindi films like Pradip Kumar (''Nagin'', ''Detective'') and Sunil Dutt (''Duniya Jhukti Hain'') and later in the 1960s for Biswajeet (''Bees saal Baad'', ''Bin Badal Barsat'', ''Kohra'') and Dharmandra (''Anupama''); he was the music composer for all these films.\n\n==Career rise==\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Hemanta had consolidated his position as a prominent singer and composer. In Bengal, he was one of the foremost exponents of [[Rabindra Sangeet]] and perhaps the most sought-after male singer. In a ceremony organised by Hemanta Mukherjee to honour Debabrata Biswas (1911\u20131980), the legendary Rabindra Sangeet exponent, in Calcutta in March 1980, Debabrata Biswas unhesitatingly mentioned Hemanta as \"the second hero\" to popularise Rabindra Sangeet, the first being the legendary Pankaj Kumar Mallick. In Mumbai, along with playback singing, Hemanta carved a niche as a composer. He composed music for a Hindi film called ''[[Nagin (1954 film)|Nagin]]'' (1954) which became a major success owing largely to its music. Songs of Nagin remained chart-toppers continuously for two years and culminated in Hemant receiving the prestigious [[Filmfare Best Music Director Award]] in 1955. The very same year, he scored music for a Bengali movie called ''Shapmochan'' in which he played back four songs for the Bengali actor [[Uttam Kumar]]. This started a long partnership between Hemant and Uttam as a playback singer-actor pair. They were the most popular singer-actor duo in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]] over the next decade.\n\nIn the latter part of the 1950s, Hemanta composed music and sang for several Bengali and Hindi films, recorded several Rabindra Sangeet and Bengali non-film songs. Almost all of these, especially his Bengali songs, became very popular. This period can be seen as the zenith of his career and lasted for almost a decade. He sang songs composed by the major music directors in Bengal such as [[Nachiketa Ghosh]], [[Robin Chatterjee]] and [[Salil Chowdhury]]. Some of the notable films Hemanta himself composed music for during this period include ''[[Harano Sur]]'', ''[[Marutirtha Hinglaj]]'', ''[[Neel Akasher Neechey]]'', ''[[Lukochuri]]'', ''Swaralipi'', ''[[Deep Jwele Jaai]]'', ''[[Shesh Parjanta]]'', ''Kuhak'', ''Dui Bhai'', and ''[[Saptapadi (1961 film)|Saptapadi]]'' in Bengali, and, ''[[Jagriti]]'' and ''[[Ek Hi Raasta (1956 film)|Ek Hi Raasta]]'' in Hindi.\n\n==Movie production==\n\nIn the late 1950s, Hemanta ventured into [[movie production]] under his own banner: Hemanta-Bela productions. The first movie under this banner was a Bengali film directed by [[Mrinal Sen]], titled ''[[Neel Akasher Neechey]]'' (1959). The story was based on the travails of a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] street hawker in Calcutta in the backdrop of [[India's freedom struggle]]. The movie went on to win the [[President's Gold Medal]] \u2014 the highest honour for a movie from [[Government of India]]. In the next decade, Hemanta's production company was renamed Geetanjali productions and it produced several Hindi movies such as ''[[Bees Saal Baad (1962 film)|Bees Saal Baad]]'', ''Kohraa'', ''Biwi Aur Makaan'', ''Faraar'', ''Rahgir'' and ''[[Khamoshi (1970 film)|Khamoshi]]'' \u2014 all of which had music by Hemanta. Only ''Bees Saal Baad'' and ''Khamoshi'' were major commercial successes.\n\nBack in Bengal, Hemanta scored music for a movie titled ''Palatak'' in 1963 where he experimented with merging [[Bengal folk music]] and light music. This proved to be a major success and Hemanta's composition style changed noticeably for many of his future films in Bengal such as ''Baghini'', and ''[[Balika Badhu (1967 film)|Balika Badhu]]''. In Bengali films ''Manihar'' and ''Adwitiya'', both of which were major musical as well as commercial successes, his compositions had a light classical tinge. In 1961, for commemorating [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s birth centenary, Gramophone company of India featured Rabindrasangeet by Hemanta in a large portion of its commemorative output. This too proved to be a major commercial success. Hemanta went on several overseas concert tours including his trip to the [[West Indies]]. Overall, in the 1960s decade he retained his position as the major male singer in Bengal and as a composer and singer to be reckoned with in Hindi films.\n\nIn the 1960s he was the predominant and lead male voice in many of Tagore's musical dramas like ''Valmiki Pratibha'', ''Shyama'', ''Sapmochan'', ''Chitrangada'' and ''Chandalika''. With Kanika Bandopadhyay (1924\u20132000) and Suchitra Mitra (1924\u20132010), who were the lead female voices in these, he was part of the [[Rabindra Sangeet]] triumvirate that was popular and respected. It was referred as 'Hemanta-Kanika-Suchitra' and, with Debabrata Biswas, this quartet was and continues to be the mostly heard exponents of Tagore compositions. Asoktaru Bandopadhyay, [[Chinmoy Chattopadhyay]], [[Sagar Sen]], Sumitra Sen and Ritu Guha were the other leading exponents of Rabindra Sangeet at that time.\n\n==Later career==\n\nIn the 1970s, Hemanta's contribution in Hindi films was nominal. He scored music for a handful of his home productions, but none of these movies were successful nor their music. In Bengal, however, he remained the foremost exponent of Rabindra Sangeet, film and non-film songs. His output continued to be popular for most of the decade. Some of them are '' Jodi jante chao tumi...'' (1972), '' Ek gochha rajanigandha '', '' Aamay prasno kore nil dhrubatara...'', Sedin tomay dekhechilam...'' (1974), ''Khirki theke singho duar...'' (''Stree'', 1971), ''Ke jane ko ghonta...'' (''Sonar Khancha, 1974), '' Jeona daraon bandhu...'' (''Phuleswari'', 1975 ) and popularised Rabindra sangeet using them beautifully in films as per situations. A very popular and classic example is the song  ''Chorono dhorite diyogo amare..'' in ''Dadar Kirti'' (1980). In 1971, Hemanta debuted as a [[film director]] in for his self-produced Bengali movie ''Anindita''. It didn't fare exceedingly well at the box office. However, his rendition ''Diner seshe ghumer deshe..'' was one of his best and popular Rabindra Sangeet renditions . In the same year Hemanta went to Hollywood by responding to famous film director Conrad Rooks and score the music of Conrad's ''Siddhartha'' and played back [ ''O Nadire...'' ( composed and sang by him earlier in '' Neel Aakaser Niche '')] in that film. He was the first Indian singer to play back in Hollywood. The US government honoured Hemanta by conferring him with the citizenship of Baltimore, Maryland; the first ever singer of India to get USA citizenship. In the early to mid-1970s, two major music composers in Bengal, [[Nachiketa Ghosh]]  and [[Robin Chatterjee]], who had worked closely with Hemanta, since the early 1950s, died. Simultaneously, music composed by Hemanta for Bengali films like ''Phuleswari'', ''Raag Anurag'', \" Ganadebata \" and ''[[Dadar Kirti]]'' established him as the major film music composer in the Bengal movie scene. In 1979, Hemanta re-recorded some of his earlier works with composer [[Salil Chowdhury]] from the 1940s and 1950s. This album, titled ''Legend of Glory, vol. 2'' was a major commercial success, despite Hemanta's aged and slightly tired voice.\n\nIn 1980, Hemanta had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] that severely affected his vocal capabilities, especially his breath control. He continued to record songs in the early eighties, but his voice was a shade of its rich [[baritone]] past. In 1984, Hemanta was felicitated by different organizations, most notably by the Gramophone Company of India, for completing 50 years in music. That very year Hemanta released his last album with Gramophone Company of India \u2014 a 45 rpm extended play disc with four non-film songs. Over the next few years, Hemanta released few non-film songs for small-time companies that had cropped up in the nascent cassette-based music industry. Only a few of these were commercially successful. He composed music for a handful of Bengali movies and one Bengali and one Hindi tele-series. However, by this time he had become an institution, a beloved and revered personality who was a courteous and friendly gentleman. His philanthropic activities included running a homeopathic hospital in memory of his late father in their native village in Baharu, in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. He continued to feature regularly on [[All India Radio]], [[Doordarshan]] (TV) and live programmes/concerts during this period.\n\nIn a television interview, recorded in the early 1990s, to noted elocutionist Gauri Ghosh, his wife Bela Mukherjee recalled that she never knew during his lifetime the number of families and persons he helped to put up financially or otherwise; only after his departure that this truth gradually unveiled.\n \nIn 1987, he was nominated for Padmabhushan which he refused politely, having already turned down a previous offer to receive Padmashree in the 1970s. In this year, he was publicly felicitated in Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta for completing 50 years in musical journey, where, Lata Mangeshkar presented him with the memento on behalf of his fans and admirers. Despite his ageing voice, he became the Best Male Singer in 1988 for his rendition in the film \"Lalan Fakir\".\n\nIn September 1989 he travelled to [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] to receive the [[Michael Madhusudan Award]], as well as to perform a concert. Immediately after returning from this trip he suffered another heart attack on 26 September and died at 11:15 pm in a nursing home in South Calcutta.\n\n==Legacy==\nNearly two decades after his death the Gramophone Company of India releases at least one album by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay every year, repackaging his older songs, because of the commercial viability of his songs. His legacy still lives on through the songs he has recorded, music he has composed, and through many male singers in Bengal and the rest of India who continue to imitate/emulate his singing style.\n\n==Awards==\n* 1956: [[Filmfare Best Music Director Award]]: ''[[Nagin (1954 film)|Nagin]]''\n* 1971: [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer]]: ''Nimantran''\n* 1986: [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer]]: ''Lalan Fakir''\n* 1962:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Swaralipi\":Won\n* 1963:BFJA Best Music Director Award (Hindi): \"Bees Saal Baad\":Won\n*1964:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Palatak\":Won\n*1967:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Minihar\":Won\n*1968:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Balika Badhu\":Won\n*1975:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Phuleawari\":Won\n*1986:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Bhalobasa Bhalobasa\":Won\n*1987:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Pathbhola\":Won\n*1988:BFJA Best Music Director Award: \"Aagoman\":Won\n* 1972: BFJA Best Male Playback Singer Award: ''Dhannyee Meye'': Won\n* 1975: BFJA Best Male Playback Singer Award: ''Phuleswari'': Won\n* 1976: BFJA Best Male Playback Singer Award: ''Priya Bandhobi'': Won\n* 1985: Honorary D.Litt. by [[Visva-Bharati University]]\n* 1986: [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]]\n* 1989: Michael Madhusudan Award\n\n==Filmography as a composer==\n\n===English filmography as a composer===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
