In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref> and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted.

Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n\n404 errors should not be confused with [[Domain Name System|DNS]] errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist.

If the proxy server is unable to satisfy a request for a page because of a problem with the remote host (such as hostname resolution failures or refused TCP connections), this should be described as a 5xx Internal Server Error, but might deliver a 404 instead.

He believed that reforming [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]], including abolishing \"[[rotten borough]]s\", would ease the poverty of farm labourers. Relentlessly he sought an end to borough-mongers, [[Sinecure|sinecurists]] and \"tax-eaters\" (meaning a wide class of overpaid or corrupt bureaucrats). Early in life he was a loyal devotee of King and Country, but he later pushed for [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]], which helped bring about the [[Reform Act 1832]] and his election that year as one of two [[member of Parliament|MPs]] for the newly enfranchised borough of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. He also strongly advocated of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. His [[polemic]]s cover subjects from political reform to religion. His best known book is ''[[Rural Rides]]'' (1830, still in print).\n\n==Life==\n{{anchor|Early life}}\n===Early life (1763\u20131791)===\n[[File:Farnham Cobbett's birthplace.JPG|250px|thumb|left|William Cobbett's birthplace.]]\nWilliam Cobbett was born in Farnham, Surrey, on 9 March 1763, the third son of George Cobbett (a farmer and publican) and Anne Vincent.<ref name=\"ODNB\">[[Ian Dyck]], '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5734 Cobbett,  William  (1763\u20131835)]', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 23 July 2011.</ref> He was taught to read and write by his father, and he started working from an early age.

Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \"buying\" votes.

As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising [[William Wilberforce]] for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, and for his personal wealth, his opposition to bull and [[bear-baiting]], and particularly for his approval of \"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\".<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/251 251\u2013252]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816 Cobbett began publishing the ''Political Register'' as a pamphlet. Cobbett now sold the ''Political Register'' for only two pence and it soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings\u2014misgovernment; and to its proper corrective\u2014parliamentary reform.<ref>Samuel Bamford, ''Bamford's Passages in the Life of a Radical, and Early Days: Vol. II'' (London: T.

With the government intending to [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|suspend ''habeas corpus'']], and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett fled to the United States.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at [[Liverpool]] for New York on the ship ''Importer'', with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John.\n\n===Refuge in the United States (1817\u20131819)===\n[[File:Cobbett - Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England, 1930 - 5214769.tif|thumb|''Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England'', 1930.]]\nCobbett lived for two years on a farm on [[Long Island]], where he wrote ''Grammar of the English Language'' and with help from [[William Benbow]], a friend in London, continued to issue the ''Political Register''.

He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Walters, Ronald G., ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett arrived back in England soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]].

That year he also established a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust (''Robinia pseudoacacia''), and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden that turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing, and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of the rural Englishman. He began riding about the country on horseback, observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing ''Rural Rides'', Cobbett also produced ''The Woodlands'' (1825), a book on [[silviculture]].<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nAlthough not a Catholic,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hanink |first=James G |date=November 2005 |title=William Cobbett.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the British reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.

He was defeated in [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the [[1832 Reform Act]], Cobbett won the seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]]. During later life, however, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], a fellow [[Member of Parliament|MP]], remarked that Cobbett's faculties were impaired by age; indeed that his [[paranoia]] had reached insanity.\n\nFrom 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of [[Normandy, Surrey]], a few miles from his birthplace at [[Farnham]]. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nDuring his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful:\n*1806 [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]]\n*1820 [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]]\n*1826 [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]]\n*1832 [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]]\n\nIn 1832 he was successfully elected as member for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Cobbett Grave 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of William Cobbett in the churchyard of St Andrew's church in Farnham.]]\nCobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti-government and democratic ideals. He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \"swagger about and be saucy to England\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \"bears the name of my country\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> [[Ian Dyck]] claimed that Cobbett endorsed \"the eighteenth-century [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] platform\".<ref>[[Ian Dyck]], 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, ''Rural Rides'' (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii.</ref> [[Edward Tangye Lean]] described him as \"an archaic English Tory\".<ref>[[Edward Tangye Lean]], ''The Napoleonists.

He believed that reforming [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]], including abolishing \"[[rotten borough]]s\", would ease the poverty of farm labourers. Relentlessly he sought an end to borough-mongers, [[Sinecure|sinecurists]] and \"tax-eaters\" (meaning a wide class of overpaid or corrupt bureaucrats). Early in life he was a loyal devotee of King and Country, but he later pushed for [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]], which helped bring about the [[Reform Act 1832]] and his election that year as one of two [[member of Parliament|MPs]] for the newly enfranchised borough of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. He also strongly advocated of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. His [[polemic]]s cover subjects from political reform to religion.

Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \"buying\" votes.

He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in [[Newgate Prison]]. While in prison he wrote the pamphlet, ''Paper Against Gold'',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cobbett |first=William |title=Paper Against Gold |url=https://archive.org/details/cobbettspaperaga00cobbrich |work=Cobbett's Paper Against Gold |publisher=California Digital Library |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> warning of the dangers of [[Banknote|paper money]], as well as many essays and letters.

As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising [[William Wilberforce]] for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, and for his personal wealth, his opposition to bull and [[bear-baiting]], and particularly for his approval of \"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\".<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/251 251\u2013252]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816 Cobbett began publishing the ''Political Register'' as a pamphlet. Cobbett now sold the ''Political Register'' for only two pence and it soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings\u2014misgovernment; and to its proper corrective\u2014parliamentary reform.<ref>Samuel Bamford, ''Bamford's Passages in the Life of a Radical, and Early Days: Vol. II'' (London: T.

With the government intending to [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|suspend ''habeas corpus'']], and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett fled to the United States.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at [[Liverpool]] for New York on the ship ''Importer'', with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John.\n\n===Refuge in the United States (1817\u20131819)===\n[[File:Cobbett - Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England, 1930 - 5214769.tif|thumb|''Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England'', 1930.]]\nCobbett lived for two years on a farm on [[Long Island]], where he wrote ''Grammar of the English Language'' and with help from [[William Benbow]], a friend in London, continued to issue the ''Political Register''. He also wrote ''The American Gardener'' (1821), one of the earliest horticultural books published in the United States.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nCobbett closely observed alcohol-drinking habits in the United States. He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Walters, Ronald G., ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett arrived back in England soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. He joined with other [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in his attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years.\n\n[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The introduction of horse-powered threshing machines to farms was one of the principal causes of the [[Swing Riots]].]]\n\nIn 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]], but finished last in the poll.  That year he also established a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust (''Robinia pseudoacacia''), and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden that turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing, and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of the rural Englishman. He began riding about the country on horseback, observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing ''Rural Rides'', Cobbett also produced ''The Woodlands'' (1825), a book on [[silviculture]].<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nAlthough not a Catholic,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hanink |first=James G |date=November 2005 |title=William Cobbett.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the British reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.  Sketch by [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]].]]\nIn 1829, Cobbett published ''Advice To Young Men'', in which he criticised ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by the Reverend [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]. That year he also published ''The English Gardener'', which he later updated and expanded. This book has been compared favourably with other contemporary garden tomes, such as [[John Claudius Loudon]]'s ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Gardening''.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nCobbett continued to publish controversy in the ''Political Register'' and was charged in July 1831 with [[seditious libel]] for a pamphlet entitled ''Rural War'', endorsing the Captain [[Swing Riots]], in which rioters were smashing farm machinery and burning haystacks. Cobbett successfully conducted his own defence.<ref>State Trials (New Series) II, 789.</ref>\n\nCobbett still sought to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the [[1832 Reform Act]], Cobbett won the seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]]. During later life, however, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], a fellow [[Member of Parliament|MP]], remarked that Cobbett's faculties were impaired by age; indeed that his [[paranoia]] had reached insanity.\n\nFrom 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of [[Normandy, Surrey]], a few miles from his birthplace at [[Farnham]]. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nDuring his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful:\n*1806 [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]]\n*1820 [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]]\n*1826 [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]]\n*1832 [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]]\n\nIn 1832 he was successfully elected as member for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Cobbett Grave 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of William Cobbett in the churchyard of St Andrew's church in Farnham.]]\nCobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti-government and democratic ideals. He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \"swagger about and be saucy to England\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \"bears the name of my country\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> [[Ian Dyck]] claimed that Cobbett endorsed \"the eighteenth-century [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] platform\".<ref>[[Ian Dyck]], 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, ''Rural Rides'' (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii.</ref> [[Edward Tangye Lean]] described him as \"an archaic English Tory\".<ref>[[Edward Tangye Lean]], ''The Napoleonists.

{"title_page": "Electron paramagnetic resonance", "text_new": "{{for|the dating technique|Electron spin resonance dating}}\n'''Electron paramagnetic resonance''' ('''EPR''') or '''electron spin resonance''' ('''ESR''') [[spectroscopy]]\nis a method for studying materials with [[unpaired electron]]s. The basic concepts of EPR are analogous to those of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), but it is electron spins that are excited instead of the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. EPR spectroscopy is particularly useful for studying metal complexes or organic radicals.\nEPR was first observed in [[Kazan State University]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] physicist [[Yevgeny Zavoisky]] in 1944,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zavoisky E | year=1945 | title=Spin-magnetic resonance in paramagnetics | journal=Fizicheski\u012d Zhurnal | volume=9 | issue= | pages=211\u2013245 | bibcode= | doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis | vauthors = Zavoisky E | year=1944 | title=Paramagnetic Absorption in Perpendicular and Parallel Fields for Salts, Solutions and Metals | degree = PhD }}</ref> and was developed independently at the same time by [[Brebis Bleaney]] at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n[[File:EPR spectometer.JPG|thumb|300px|EPR [[spectrometer]]]]\n\n== Theory ==\n\n=== Origin of an EPR signal ===\nEvery electron has a [[magnetic moment]] and [[spin quantum number]] <math> s = \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>, with magnetic components <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = + \\tfrac{1}{2} </math> or <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = - \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>. In the presence of an external magnetic field with strength <math> B_\\mathrm{0} </math>, the electron's magnetic moment aligns itself either antiparallel (<math> m_\\mathrm{s} = - \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>) or parallel (<math> m_\\mathrm{s} = + \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>) to the field, each alignment having a specific energy due to the [[Zeeman effect]]:\n\n:<math>E = m_s g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0,</math>\n\nwhere\n* <math> g_e </math> is the electron's so-called [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] (see also the [[Land\u00e9 g-factor|Land\u00e9 ''g''-factor]]), <math> g_\\mathrm{e} = 2.0023</math> for the free electron,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Odom B, Hanneke D, D'Urso B, Gabrielse G | title = New measurement of the electron magnetic moment using a one-electron quantum cyclotron | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 030801 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16907490 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.030801 | bibcode = 2006PhRvL..97c0801O }}</ref>\n* <math> \\mu_\\text{B} </math> is the [[Bohr magneton]].\n\nTherefore, the separation between the lower and the upper state is <math> \\Delta E = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0 </math> for unpaired free electrons. This equation implies (since both <math> g_e </math>and <math> \\mu_\\text{B} </math> are constant) that the splitting of the energy levels is directly proportional to the [[magnetic field]]'s strength, as shown in the diagram below.\n[[File:EPR splitting.svg|300px|centre|Splitting of electron spin states]]\n\nAn unpaired electron can move between the two energy levels by either absorbing or emitting a [[photon]] of energy <math> h \\nu </math> such that the resonance condition, <math> h \\nu = \\Delta E </math>, is obeyed. This leads to the fundamental equation of EPR spectroscopy: <math> h \\nu = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0 </math>.\n\nExperimentally, this equation permits a large combination of frequency and magnetic field values, but the great majority of EPR measurements are made with microwaves in the 9000\u201310000&nbsp;MHz (9\u201310&nbsp;GHz) region, with fields corresponding to about 3500 [[gauss (unit)|G]] (0.35 [[tesla (unit)|T]]). Furthermore, EPR spectra can be generated by either varying the photon frequency incident on a sample while holding the magnetic field constant or doing the reverse. In practice, it is usually the frequency that is kept fixed. A collection of [[paramagnetic]] centers, such as free radicals, is exposed to microwaves at a fixed frequency. By increasing an external magnetic field, the gap between the <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = + \\tfrac{1}{2} </math> and <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = - \\tfrac{1}{2} </math> energy states is widened until it matches the energy of the microwaves, as represented by the double arrow in the diagram above. At this point the unpaired electrons can move between their two spin states. Since there typically are more electrons in the lower state, due to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution (see below), there is a net absorption of energy, and it is this absorption that is monitored and converted into a spectrum. The upper spectrum below is the simulated absorption for a system of free electrons in a varying magnetic field. The lower spectrum is the first derivative of the absorption spectrum. The latter is the most common way to record and publish continuous wave EPR spectra.\n\n[[File:EPR lines.png|300px|center]]\n\nFor the microwave frequency of 9388.2&nbsp;MHz, the predicted resonance occurs at a magnetic field of about <math> B_0 = h \\nu / g_e \\mu_\\text{B} </math> = 0.3350 T = 3350 G\n\nBecause of electron-nuclear mass differences, the [[magnetic moment]] of an electron is substantially larger than the corresponding quantity for any nucleus, so that a much higher electromagnetic frequency is needed to bring about a spin resonance with an electron than with a nucleus, at identical magnetic field strengths. For example, for the field of 3350 G shown above, spin resonance occurs near 9388.2&nbsp;MHz for an electron compared to only about 14.3&nbsp;MHz for <sup>1</sup>H nuclei. (For NMR spectroscopy, the corresponding resonance equation is <math> h\\nu = g_\\mathrm{N} \\mu_\\mathrm{N} B_0</math> where <math>g_\\mathrm{N}</math> and <math> \\mu_\\mathrm{N} </math> depend on the nucleus under study.)\n\n=== Field modulation ===\n[[File:Field modulation diagram.jpg|thumb|The field oscillates between B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> due to the superimposed modulation field at 100&nbsp;kHz. This causes the absorption intensity to oscillate between I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>. The larger the difference the larger the intensity detected by the detector tuned to 100&nbsp;kHz (note this can be negative or even 0). As the difference between the two intensities is detected the first derivative of the absorption is detected.]]\nAs previously mentioned an EPR spectrum is usually directly measured as the first derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field is applied to the external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Electron-Paramagnetic-Resonance-Chemistry-Primers/0198727607/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1492443665&sr=8-1&keywords=electron+paramagnetic+resonance|title=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|last=Chechik|first=Victor|last2=Carter|first2=Emma|last3=Murphy|first3=Damien | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-07-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-872760-6|location=New York, NY }}</ref> By detecting the peak to peak amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100&nbsp;kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.\n\n=== Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution ===\nIn practice, EPR samples consist of collections of many paramagnetic species, and not single isolated paramagnetic centers.

At 298 K, X-band microwave frequencies (<math>\\nu</math> \u2248 9.75&nbsp;GHz) give <math>n_\\text{upper} / n_\\text{lower}</math> \u2248 0.998, meaning that the upper energy level has a slightly smaller population than the lower one. Therefore, transitions from the lower to the higher level are more probable than the reverse, which is why there is a net absorption of energy.\n\nThe sensitivity of the EPR method (i.e., the minimal number of detectable spins <math>N_\\text{min}</math>) depends on the photon frequency <math>\\nu</math> according to\n\n:<math>N_\\text{min} = \\frac{k_1V}{Q_0k_f \\nu^2 P^{1/2}}, \\qquad \\text{(Eq. 2)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>k_1</math> is a constant, <math>V</math> is the sample's volume, <math>Q_0</math> is the unloaded [[Q factor|quality factor]] of the microwave cavity (sample chamber), <math>k_f</math> is the cavity filling coefficient, and <math>P</math> is the microwave power in the spectrometer cavity. With <math>k_f</math> and <math>P</math> being constants, <math>N_\\text{min}</math> ~ <math>(Q_0\\nu^2)^{-1}</math>, i.e., <math>N_\\text{min}</math> ~ <math>\\nu^{-\\alpha}</math>, where <math>\\alpha</math> \u2248 1.5. In practice, <math>\\alpha</math> can change varying from 0.5 to 4.5 depending on spectrometer characteristics, resonance conditions, and sample size.\n\nA great sensitivity is therefore obtained with a low detection limit <math>N_\\text{min}</math> and a large number of spins. Therefore, the required parameters are:\n* A high spectrometer frequency to maximize the Eq. 2. Common frequencies are discussed [[Electron paramagnetic resonance#High-field high-frequency measurements|below]]\n* A low temperature to decrease the number of spin at the high level of energy as shown in Eq. 1. This condition explains why spectra are often recorded on sample at the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[liquid helium]].\n\n== Spectral parameters ==\nIn real systems, electrons are normally not solitary, but are associated with one or more atoms. There are several important consequences of this:\n# An unpaired electron can gain or lose angular momentum, which can change the value of its ''g''-factor, causing it to differ from <math> g_e </math>. This is especially significant for chemical systems with transition-metal ions.\n# The magnetic moment of a nucleus with a non-zero nuclear spin will affect any unpaired electrons associated with that atom. This leads to the phenomenon of [[hyperfine coupling]], analogous to [[J-coupling|''J''-coupling]] in NMR, splitting the EPR resonance signal into doublets, triplets and so forth.\n# Interactions of an unpaired electron with its environment influence the shape of an EPR spectral line. Line shapes can yield information about, for example,  rates of chemical reactions.<ref>{{cite book | first = Ira N. | last = Levine | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular Spectroscopy | publisher = Wiley & Sons, Inc. | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-0-471-53128-9 | page = 380 }}</ref>\n# The ''g''-factor and hyperfine coupling in an atom or molecule may not be the same for all orientations of an unpaired electron in an external magnetic field. This [[anisotropy]] depends upon the electronic structure of the atom or molecule (e.g., free radical) in question, and so can provide information about the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.\n\n=== The ''g'' factor ===\nKnowledge of the [[Land\u00e9 g-factor|''g''-factor]] can give information about a paramagnetic center's electronic structure. An unpaired electron responds not only to a spectrometer's applied magnetic field <math>B_0 </math> but also to any local magnetic fields of atoms or molecules. The effective field <math> B_\\text{eff} </math> experienced by an electron is thus written\n\n:<math>B_\\text{eff} = B_0(1 - \\sigma),</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\sigma </math> includes the effects of local fields (<math>\\sigma</math> can be positive or negative). Therefore, the <math>h \\nu = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_\\text{eff} </math> resonance condition (above) is rewritten as follows:\n\n:<math>h\\nu = g_e \\mu_B B_\\text{eff} = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0 (1 - \\sigma).</math>\n\nThe quantity <math> g_e(1 - \\sigma) </math> is denoted <math> g </math> and called simply the ''g''-factor, so that the final resonance equation becomes\n\n:<math>h \\nu = g \\mu_\\text{B} B_0.</math>\n\nThis last equation is used to determine <math> g </math> in an EPR experiment by measuring the field and the frequency at which resonance occurs. If <math> g </math> does not equal <math> g_e </math>, the implication is that the ratio of the unpaired electron's spin magnetic moment to its angular momentum differs from the free-electron value. Since an electron's spin magnetic moment is constant (approximately the Bohr magneton), then the electron must have gained or lost angular momentum through [[spin\u2013orbit coupling]]. Because the mechanisms of spin\u2013orbit coupling are well understood, the magnitude of the change gives information about the nature of the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.\n\nIn general, the ''g'' factor is not a [[Scalar (mathematics)|number]] but a second-rank [[tensor]] represented by 9 numbers arranged in a 3\u00d73 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The [[Crystal structure|principal axes]] of this tensor are determined by the local fields, for example, by the local atomic arrangement around the unpaired spin in a solid or in a molecule. Choosing an appropriate coordinate system (say, ''x'',''y'',''z'') allows one to \"diagonalize\" this tensor, thereby reducing the maximal number of its components from 9 to 3: ''g<sub>xx</sub>'', ''g<sub>yy</sub>'' and ''g<sub>zz</sub>''. For a single spin experiencing only Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field, the position of the EPR resonance is given by the expression ''g<sub>xx</sub>B<sub>x</sub>'' + ''g<sub>yy</sub>B<sub>y</sub>'' + ''g<sub>zz</sub>B<sub>z</sub>''. Here ''B<sub>x</sub>'', ''B<sub>y</sub>'' and ''B<sub>z</sub>'' are the components of the magnetic field vector in the coordinate system (''x'',''y'',''z''); their magnitudes change as the field is rotated, so does the frequency of the resonance. For a large ensemble of randomly oriented spins, the EPR spectrum consists of three peaks of characteristic shape at frequencies ''g<sub>xx</sub>B''<sub>0</sub>, ''g<sub>yy</sub>B''<sub>0</sub> and ''g<sub>zz</sub>B''<sub>0</sub>: the low-frequency peak is positive in first-derivative spectra, the high-frequency peak is negative, and the central peak is bipolar. Such situations are commonly observed in powders, and the spectra are therefore called \"powder-pattern spectra\". In crystals, the number of EPR lines is determined by the number of crystallographically equivalent orientations of the EPR spin (called \"EPR center\").\n\n=== Hyperfine coupling ===\nSince the source of an EPR spectrum is a change in an electron's spin state, the EPR spectrum for a radical (S = 1/2 system) would consist of one line. Greater complexity arises because the spin couples with nearby nuclear spins.  The magnitude of the coupling is proportional to the magnetic moment of the coupled nuclei and depends on the mechanism of the coupling.  Coupling is mediated by two processes, dipolar (through space) and isotropic (through bond).\n\nThis coupling introduces additional energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The [[hyperfine coupling]] constant of a nucleus is directly related to the spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself. <ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Encyclopedia of Spectroscopy and Spectrometry|publisher=Academic Press|year=2016|isbn=9780128032251|location=|pages=521, 528}}</ref>\n\nTwo common mechanisms by which electrons and nuclei interact are the [[Fermi contact interaction]] and by dipolar interaction. The former applies largely to the case of isotropic interactions (independent of sample orientation in a magnetic field) and the latter to the case of anisotropic interactions (spectra dependent on sample orientation in a magnetic field). Spin polarization is a third mechanism for interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin, being especially important for <math>\\pi</math>-electron organic radicals, such as the benzene radical anion. The symbols \"''a''\" or \"''A''\" are used for isotropic hyperfine coupling constants, while \"''B''\" is usually employed for anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants.<ref>Strictly speaking, \"''a''\" refers to the hyperfine splitting constant, a line spacing measured in magnetic field units, while ''A'' and ''B'' refer to hyperfine coupling constants measured in frequency units. Splitting and coupling constants are proportional, but not identical. The book by Wertz and Bolton has more information (pp. 46 and 442). {{cite book | vauthors = Wertz JE, Bolton JR | date = 1972 | title = Electron spin resonance: Elementary theory and practical applications. | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill }}</ref>\n\nIn many cases, the isotropic hyperfine splitting pattern for a radical freely tumbling in a solution (isotropic system) can be predicted.\n\n====Multiplicity====\n* For a radical having ''M'' equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I'', the number of EPR lines expected is 2''MI''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. As an example, the methyl radical, CH<sub>3</sub>, has three <sup>1</sup>H nuclei, each with ''I''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2, and so the number of lines expected is 2''MI''&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 2(3)(1/2)&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 4, which is as observed.\n* For a radical having ''M''<sub>1</sub> equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I''<sub>1</sub>, and a group of ''M''<sub>2</sub> equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I''<sub>2</sub>, the number of lines expected is (2''M''<sub>1</sub>''I''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+ 1) (2''M''<sub>2</sub>''I''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ 1). As an example, the methoxymethyl radical, H<sub>2</sub>C(OCH<sub>3</sub>), has two equivalent <sup>1</sup>H nuclei, each with ''I''&nbsp;= 1/2 and three equivalent <sup>1</sup>H nuclei each with ''I''&nbsp;= 1/2, and so the number of lines expected is (2''M''<sub>1</sub>''I''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+ 1) (2''M''<sub>2</sub>''I''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ 1) = [2(2)(1/2) + 1] [2(3)(1/2) + 1] = 3\u00d74 = 12, again as observed.\n[[File:EPR methyl.png|thumb|right|300px|Simulated EPR spectrum of the CH<sub>3</sub> radical]]\n* The above can be extended to predict the number of lines for any number of nuclei.\n\nWhile it is easy to predict the number of lines, the reverse problem, unraveling a complex multi-line EPR spectrum and assigning the various spacings to specific nuclei, is more difficult.\n\nIn the often encountered case of ''I''&nbsp;= 1/2 nuclei (e.g., <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P), the line intensities produced by a population of radicals, each possessing ''M'' equivalent nuclei, will follow [[Pascal's triangle]]. For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three <sup>1</sup>H nuclei of the CH<sub>3</sub> radical give rise to 2''MI''&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 2(3)(1/2)&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio. The line spacing gives a hyperfine coupling constant of ''a''<sub>H</sub> = 23 ''G'' for each of the three <sup>1</sup>H nuclei. Note again that the lines in this spectrum are ''first derivatives'' of absorptions.\n\n[[File:EPR methoxymethyl.png|thumb|right|300px|Simulated EPR spectrum of the H<sub>2</sub>C(OCH<sub>3</sub>) radical]]\nAs a second example, the methoxymethyl radical, H<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub><sup>'''.'''</sup> the OC''H''<sub>2</sub> center will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component of which is further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3\u00d74&nbsp;= 12 lines, a triplet of quartets. A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities. Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller line spacing) is due to the three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron. It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's unpaired electron, but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>).\n\n=== Resonance linewidth definition ===\nResonance linewidths are defined in terms of the magnetic induction ''B'' and its corresponding units, and are measured along the ''x'' axis of an EPR spectrum, from a line's center to a chosen reference point of the line. These defined widths are called [[spectroscopic line shape|halfwidths]] and possess some advantages: for asymmetric lines, values of left and right halfwidth can be given. The halfwidth <math>\\Delta B_h</math> is the distance measured from the line's center to the point in which [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] value has half of maximal absorption value in the center of [[resonance]] line. First inclination width <math>\\Delta B_{1/2}</math> is a distance from center of the line to the point of maximal absorption curve inclination. In practice, a full definition of linewidth is used. For symmetric lines, halfwidth <math>\\Delta B_{1/2} = 2\\Delta B_h</math>, and full inclination width <math>\\Delta B_\\text{max} = 2\\Delta B_{1s}</math>.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:ESR-STM at QNS in Ewha - front view.jpg|thumb|This low-temperature ESR-[[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] in the [[Center for Quantum Nanoscience]] is one of the first STMs globally to measure electron spin resonance on single atoms.]]\nEPR/ESR spectroscopy is used in various branches of science, such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], for the detection and identification of [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] and paramagnetic centers such as [[F-center]]s. EPR is a sensitive, specific method for studying both radicals formed in chemical reactions and the reactions themselves. For example, when ice (solid H<sub>2</sub>O) is decomposed by exposure to high-energy radiation, radicals such as H, OH, and HO<sub>2</sub> are produced. Such radicals can be identified and studied by EPR. Organic and inorganic radicals can be detected in electrochemical systems and in materials exposed to [[UV]] light. In many cases, the reactions to make the radicals and the subsequent reactions of the radicals are of interest, while in other cases EPR is used to provide information on a radical's geometry and the orbital of the unpaired electron. EPR/ESR spectroscopy is also used in geology and archaeology as a dating tool. It can be applied to a wide range of materials such as carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, silica or other silicates.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New Applications of Electron Spin Resonance|last=Ikeya|first=Motoji | name-list-format = vanc |doi=10.1142/1854|year = 1993|isbn = 978-981-02-1199-8}}</ref>\n\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has proven itself as a useful tool in [[homogeneous catalysis]] research for characterization of [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] complexes and [[reactive intermediate]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goswami|first=Monalisa|last2=Chirila|first2=Andrei|last3=Rebreyend|first3=Christophe|last4=de Bruin|first4=Bas|date=2015-09-01|title=EPR Spectroscopy as a Tool in Homogeneous Catalysis Research|journal=Topics in Catalysis|language=en|volume=58|issue=12|pages=719\u2013750|doi=10.1007/s11244-015-0414-9|issn=1572-9028|doi-access=free}}</ref> EPR spectroscopy is a particularly useful tool to investigate their [[electronic structure]]s, which is fundamental to understand their [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]].\n\n[[medicine|Medical]] and [[biology|biological]] applications of EPR also exist.

Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control of the flow of microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.\n\nMost EPR spectrometers are reflection spectrometers, meaning that the detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation coming back from the cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the [[circulator]] which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.\n\n==== Reference arm ====\n\nAt low energies (less than 1 \u03bcW) the diode current is proportional to the microwave power and the detector is referred to as a [[square-law detector]]. At higher power levels (greater than 1&nbsp;mW) the diode current is proportional to the square root of the microwave power and the detector is called a linear detector. In order to obtain optimal sensitivity as well as quantitative information the diode should be operating within the linear region. To ensure the detector is operating at that level the reference arm serves to provide a \"bias\".\n\n=== Magnet ===\nIn an EPR spectrometer the magnetic assembly includes the magnet with a dedicated power supply as well as a field sensor or regulator such as a [[Hall effect sensor|Hall probe]]. EPR spectrometers use one of two types of magnet which is determined by the operating microwave frequency (which determine the range of magnetic field strengths required). The first is an electromagnet which are generally capable of generating field strengths of up to 1.5 T making them suitable for measurements using the Q-band frequency. In order to generate field strengths appropriate for W-band and higher frequency operation superconducting magnets are employed. The magnetic field is homogeneous across the sample volume and has a high stability at static field.\n\n=== Microwave resonator (cavity) ===\nThe microwave resonator is designed to enhance the microwave magnetic field at the sample in order to induce EPR transitions. It is a metal box with a rectangular or cylindrical shape that resonates with microwaves (like an organ pipe with sound waves). At the resonance frequency of the cavity microwaves remain inside the cavity and are not reflected back. Resonance means the cavity stores microwave energy and its ability to do this is given by the quality factor {{mvar|Q}}, defined by the following equation:\n\n<math>Q=\\frac {2\\pi(energy\\  stored)}{(energy\\ dissipated)}</math>\n\nThe higher the value of {{mvar|Q}} the higher the sensitivity of the spectrometer. The energy dissipated is the energy lost in one microwave period. Energy may be lost to the side walls of the cavity as microwaves may generate currents which in turn generate heat. A consequence of resonance is the creation of a standing wave inside the cavity. Electromagnetic standing waves have their electric and magnetic field components exactly out of phase. This provides an advantage as the electric field provides non-resonant absorption of the microwaves, which in turn increases the dissipated energy and reduces {{mvar|Q}}. To achieve the largest signals and hence sensitivity the sample is positioned such that it lies within the magnetic field maximum and the electric field minimum. When the magnetic field strength is such that an absorption event occurs, the value of {{mvar|Q}} will be reduced due to the extra energy loss. This results in a change of impedance which serves to stop the cavity from being critically coupled. This means microwaves will now be reflected back to the detector (in the microwave bridge) where an EPR signal is detected.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=Gareth R.|last2=Eaton|first2= Sandra S.|last3=Barr|first3= David P.|last4=Weber|first4= Ralph T. |name-list-format = vanc |title=Basics of Continuous Wave EPR|journal=Quantitative EPR|date=2010|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1007/978-3-211-92948-3_1 | isbn=978-3-211-92947-6}}</ref>\n\n== Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance ==\n{{details|Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance}}\n\nThe dynamics of electron spins are best studied with pulsed measurements.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Arthur | last1 = Schweiger | first2 = Gunnar | last2 = Jeschke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-19-850634-8 }}</ref> Microwave pulses typically 10\u2013100 ns long are used to control the spins in the [[Bloch sphere]].

The basic concepts of EPR are analogous to those of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), but it is electron spins that are excited instead of the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. EPR spectroscopy is particularly useful for studying metal complexes or organic radicals.\nEPR was first observed in [[Kazan State University]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] physicist [[Yevgeny Zavoisky]] in 1944,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zavoisky E | year=1945 | title=Spin-magnetic resonance in paramagnetics | journal=Fizicheski\u012d Zhurnal | volume=9 | issue= | pages=211\u2013245 | bibcode= | doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis | vauthors = Zavoisky E | year=1944 | title=Paramagnetic Absorption in Perpendicular and Parallel Fields for Salts, Solutions and Metals | degree = PhD }}</ref> and was developed independently at the same time by [[Brebis Bleaney]] at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n[[File:EPR spectometer.JPG|thumb|300px|EPR [[spectrometer]]]]\n\n== Theory ==\n\n=== Origin of an EPR signal ===\nEvery electron has a [[magnetic moment]] and [[spin quantum number]] <math> s = \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>, with magnetic components <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = + \\tfrac{1}{2} </math> or <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = - \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>. In the presence of an external magnetic field with strength <math> B_\\mathrm{0} </math>, the electron's magnetic moment aligns itself either antiparallel (<math> m_\\mathrm{s} = - \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>) or parallel (<math> m_\\mathrm{s} = + \\tfrac{1}{2} </math>) to the field, each alignment having a specific energy due to the [[Zeeman effect]]:\n\n:<math>E = m_s g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0,</math>\n\nwhere\n* <math> g_e </math> is the electron's so-called [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] (see also the [[Land\u00e9 g-factor|Land\u00e9 ''g''-factor]]), <math> g_\\mathrm{e} = 2.0023</math> for the free electron,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Odom B, Hanneke D, D'Urso B, Gabrielse G | title = New measurement of the electron magnetic moment using a one-electron quantum cyclotron | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 030801 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16907490 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.030801 | bibcode = 2006PhRvL..97c0801O }}</ref>\n* <math> \\mu_\\text{B} </math> is the [[Bohr magneton]].\n\nTherefore, the separation between the lower and the upper state is <math> \\Delta E = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0 </math> for unpaired free electrons. This equation implies (since both <math> g_e </math>and <math> \\mu_\\text{B} </math> are constant) that the splitting of the energy levels is directly proportional to the [[magnetic field]]'s strength, as shown in the diagram below.\n[[File:EPR splitting.svg|300px|centre|Splitting of electron spin states]]\n\nAn unpaired electron can move between the two energy levels by either absorbing or emitting a [[photon]] of energy <math> h \\nu </math> such that the resonance condition, <math> h \\nu = \\Delta E </math>, is obeyed. This leads to the fundamental equation of EPR spectroscopy: <math> h \\nu = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0 </math>.\n\nExperimentally, this equation permits a large combination of frequency and magnetic field values, but the great majority of EPR measurements are made with microwaves in the 9000\u201310000&nbsp;MHz (9\u201310&nbsp;GHz) region, with fields corresponding to about 3500 [[gauss (unit)|G]] (0.35 [[tesla (unit)|T]]). Furthermore, EPR spectra can be generated by either varying the photon frequency incident on a sample while holding the magnetic field constant or doing the reverse. In practice, it is usually the frequency that is kept fixed. A collection of [[paramagnetic]] centers, such as free radicals, is exposed to microwaves at a fixed frequency. By increasing an external magnetic field, the gap between the <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = + \\tfrac{1}{2} </math> and <math> m_\\mathrm{s} = - \\tfrac{1}{2} </math> energy states is widened until it matches the energy of the microwaves, as represented by the double arrow in the diagram above. At this point the unpaired electrons can move between their two spin states. Since there typically are more electrons in the lower state, due to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution (see below), there is a net absorption of energy, and it is this absorption that is monitored and converted into a spectrum. The upper spectrum below is the simulated absorption for a system of free electrons in a varying magnetic field. The lower spectrum is the first derivative of the absorption spectrum. The latter is the most common way to record and publish continuous wave EPR spectra.\n\n[[File:EPR lines.png|300px|center]]\n\nFor the microwave frequency of 9388.2&nbsp;MHz, the predicted resonance occurs at a magnetic field of about <math> B_0 = h \\nu / g_e \\mu_\\text{B} </math> = 0.3350 T = 3350 G\n\nBecause of electron-nuclear mass differences, the [[magnetic moment]] of an electron is substantially larger than the corresponding quantity for any nucleus, so that a much higher electromagnetic frequency is needed to bring about a spin resonance with an electron than with a nucleus, at identical magnetic field strengths. For example, for the field of 3350 G shown above, spin resonance occurs near 9388.2&nbsp;MHz for an electron compared to only about 14.3&nbsp;MHz for <sup>1</sup>H nuclei. (For NMR spectroscopy, the corresponding resonance equation is <math> h\\nu = g_\\mathrm{N} \\mu_\\mathrm{N} B_0</math> where <math>g_\\mathrm{N}</math> and <math> \\mu_\\mathrm{N} </math> depend on the nucleus under study.)\n\n=== Field modulation ===\n[[File:Field modulation diagram.jpg|thumb|The field oscillates between B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> due to the superimposed modulation field at 100&nbsp;kHz. This causes the absorption intensity to oscillate between I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>. The larger the difference the larger the intensity detected by the detector tuned to 100&nbsp;kHz (note this can be negative or even 0). As the difference between the two intensities is detected the first derivative of the absorption is detected.]]\nAs previously mentioned an EPR spectrum is usually directly measured as the first derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field is applied to the external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Electron-Paramagnetic-Resonance-Chemistry-Primers/0198727607/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1492443665&sr=8-1&keywords=electron+paramagnetic+resonance|title=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|last=Chechik|first=Victor|last2=Carter|first2=Emma|last3=Murphy|first3=Damien | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-07-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-872760-6|location=New York, NY }}</ref> By detecting the peak to peak amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100&nbsp;kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.\n\n=== Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution ===\nIn practice, EPR samples consist of collections of many paramagnetic species, and not single isolated paramagnetic centers. If the population of radicals is in thermodynamic equilibrium, its statistical distribution is described by the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{ n_\\text{upper} }{ n_\\text{lower} } = \\exp{ \\left( -\\frac{ E_\\text{upper}-E_\\text{lower} }{ kT } \\right) } = \\exp{ \\left( -\\frac{ \\Delta E }{ kT } \\right) } = \\exp{ \\left( -\\frac{ \\epsilon }{ kT } \\right) } = \\exp{ \\left( -\\frac{ h\\nu }{ kT }\\right) }, \\qquad \\text{(Eq. 1)} </math>\n\nwhere <math>n_\\text{upper}</math> is the number of paramagnetic centers occupying the upper energy state, <math>k</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and <math>T</math> is the [[thermodynamic temperature]]. At 298 K, X-band microwave frequencies (<math>\\nu</math> \u2248 9.75&nbsp;GHz) give <math>n_\\text{upper} / n_\\text{lower}</math> \u2248 0.998, meaning that the upper energy level has a slightly smaller population than the lower one. Therefore, transitions from the lower to the higher level are more probable than the reverse, which is why there is a net absorption of energy.\n\nThe sensitivity of the EPR method (i.e., the minimal number of detectable spins <math>N_\\text{min}</math>) depends on the photon frequency <math>\\nu</math> according to\n\n:<math>N_\\text{min} = \\frac{k_1V}{Q_0k_f \\nu^2 P^{1/2}}, \\qquad \\text{(Eq. 2)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>k_1</math> is a constant, <math>V</math> is the sample's volume, <math>Q_0</math> is the unloaded [[Q factor|quality factor]] of the microwave cavity (sample chamber), <math>k_f</math> is the cavity filling coefficient, and <math>P</math> is the microwave power in the spectrometer cavity. With <math>k_f</math> and <math>P</math> being constants, <math>N_\\text{min}</math> ~ <math>(Q_0\\nu^2)^{-1}</math>, i.e., <math>N_\\text{min}</math> ~ <math>\\nu^{-\\alpha}</math>, where <math>\\alpha</math> \u2248 1.5. In practice, <math>\\alpha</math> can change varying from 0.5 to 4.5 depending on spectrometer characteristics, resonance conditions, and sample size.\n\nA great sensitivity is therefore obtained with a low detection limit <math>N_\\text{min}</math> and a large number of spins. Therefore, the required parameters are:\n* A high spectrometer frequency to maximize the Eq. 2. Common frequencies are discussed [[Electron paramagnetic resonance#High-field high-frequency measurements|below]]\n* A low temperature to decrease the number of spin at the high level of energy as shown in Eq. 1. This condition explains why spectra are often recorded on sample at the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[liquid helium]].\n\n== Spectral parameters ==\nIn real systems, electrons are normally not solitary, but are associated with one or more atoms. There are several important consequences of this:\n# An unpaired electron can gain or lose angular momentum, which can change the value of its ''g''-factor, causing it to differ from <math> g_e </math>. This is especially significant for chemical systems with transition-metal ions.\n# The magnetic moment of a nucleus with a non-zero nuclear spin will affect any unpaired electrons associated with that atom. This leads to the phenomenon of [[hyperfine coupling]], analogous to [[J-coupling|''J''-coupling]] in NMR, splitting the EPR resonance signal into doublets, triplets and so forth.\n# Interactions of an unpaired electron with its environment influence the shape of an EPR spectral line. Line shapes can yield information about, for example,  rates of chemical reactions.<ref>{{cite book | first = Ira N. | last = Levine | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular Spectroscopy | publisher = Wiley & Sons, Inc. | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-0-471-53128-9 | page = 380 }}</ref>\n# The ''g''-factor and hyperfine coupling in an atom or molecule may not be the same for all orientations of an unpaired electron in an external magnetic field. This [[anisotropy]] depends upon the electronic structure of the atom or molecule (e.g., free radical) in question, and so can provide information about the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.\n\n=== The ''g'' factor ===\nKnowledge of the [[Land\u00e9 g-factor|''g''-factor]] can give information about a paramagnetic center's electronic structure. An unpaired electron responds not only to a spectrometer's applied magnetic field <math>B_0 </math> but also to any local magnetic fields of atoms or molecules. The effective field <math> B_\\text{eff} </math> experienced by an electron is thus written\n\n:<math>B_\\text{eff} = B_0(1 - \\sigma),</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\sigma </math> includes the effects of local fields (<math>\\sigma</math> can be positive or negative). Therefore, the <math>h \\nu = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_\\text{eff} </math> resonance condition (above) is rewritten as follows:\n\n:<math>h\\nu = g_e \\mu_B B_\\text{eff} = g_e \\mu_\\text{B} B_0 (1 - \\sigma).</math>\n\nThe quantity <math> g_e(1 - \\sigma) </math> is denoted <math> g </math> and called simply the ''g''-factor, so that the final resonance equation becomes\n\n:<math>h \\nu = g \\mu_\\text{B} B_0.</math>\n\nThis last equation is used to determine <math> g </math> in an EPR experiment by measuring the field and the frequency at which resonance occurs. If <math> g </math> does not equal <math> g_e </math>, the implication is that the ratio of the unpaired electron's spin magnetic moment to its angular momentum differs from the free-electron value. Since an electron's spin magnetic moment is constant (approximately the Bohr magneton), then the electron must have gained or lost angular momentum through [[spin\u2013orbit coupling]]. Because the mechanisms of spin\u2013orbit coupling are well understood, the magnitude of the change gives information about the nature of the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.\n\nIn general, the ''g'' factor is not a [[Scalar (mathematics)|number]] but a second-rank [[tensor]] represented by 9 numbers arranged in a 3\u00d73 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The [[Crystal structure|principal axes]] of this tensor are determined by the local fields, for example, by the local atomic arrangement around the unpaired spin in a solid or in a molecule. Choosing an appropriate coordinate system (say, ''x'',''y'',''z'') allows one to \"diagonalize\" this tensor, thereby reducing the maximal number of its components from 9 to 3: ''g<sub>xx</sub>'', ''g<sub>yy</sub>'' and ''g<sub>zz</sub>''. For a single spin experiencing only Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field, the position of the EPR resonance is given by the expression ''g<sub>xx</sub>B<sub>x</sub>'' + ''g<sub>yy</sub>B<sub>y</sub>'' + ''g<sub>zz</sub>B<sub>z</sub>''. Here ''B<sub>x</sub>'', ''B<sub>y</sub>'' and ''B<sub>z</sub>'' are the components of the magnetic field vector in the coordinate system (''x'',''y'',''z''); their magnitudes change as the field is rotated, so does the frequency of the resonance. For a large ensemble of randomly oriented spins, the EPR spectrum consists of three peaks of characteristic shape at frequencies ''g<sub>xx</sub>B''<sub>0</sub>, ''g<sub>yy</sub>B''<sub>0</sub> and ''g<sub>zz</sub>B''<sub>0</sub>: the low-frequency peak is positive in first-derivative spectra, the high-frequency peak is negative, and the central peak is bipolar. Such situations are commonly observed in powders, and the spectra are therefore called \"powder-pattern spectra\". In crystals, the number of EPR lines is determined by the number of crystallographically equivalent orientations of the EPR spin (called \"EPR center\").\n\n=== Hyperfine coupling ===\nSince the source of an EPR spectrum is a change in an electron's spin state, the EPR spectrum for a radical (S = 1/2 system) would consist of one line. Greater complexity arises because the spin couples with nearby nuclear spins.  The magnitude of the coupling is proportional to the magnetic moment of the coupled nuclei and depends on the mechanism of the coupling.  Coupling is mediated by two processes, dipolar (through space) and isotropic (through bond).\n\nThis coupling introduces additional energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The [[hyperfine coupling]] constant of a nucleus is directly related to the spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself. {{citation needed | reason = no citation provided for last two paragraphs | date = January 2018 }}\n\nTwo common mechanisms by which electrons and nuclei interact are the [[Fermi contact interaction]] and by dipolar interaction. The former applies largely to the case of isotropic interactions (independent of sample orientation in a magnetic field) and the latter to the case of anisotropic interactions (spectra dependent on sample orientation in a magnetic field). Spin polarization is a third mechanism for interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin, being especially important for <math>\\pi</math>-electron organic radicals, such as the benzene radical anion. The symbols \"''a''\" or \"''A''\" are used for isotropic hyperfine coupling constants, while \"''B''\" is usually employed for anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants.<ref>Strictly speaking, \"''a''\" refers to the hyperfine splitting constant, a line spacing measured in magnetic field units, while ''A'' and ''B'' refer to hyperfine coupling constants measured in frequency units. Splitting and coupling constants are proportional, but not identical. The book by Wertz and Bolton has more information (pp. 46 and 442). {{cite book | vauthors = Wertz JE, Bolton JR | date = 1972 | title = Electron spin resonance: Elementary theory and practical applications. | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill }}</ref>\n\nIn many cases, the isotropic hyperfine splitting pattern for a radical freely tumbling in a solution (isotropic system) can be predicted.\n\n====Multiplicity====\n* For a radical having ''M'' equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I'', the number of EPR lines expected is 2''MI''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. As an example, the methyl radical, CH<sub>3</sub>, has three <sup>1</sup>H nuclei, each with ''I''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2, and so the number of lines expected is 2''MI''&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 2(3)(1/2)&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 4, which is as observed.\n* For a radical having ''M''<sub>1</sub> equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I''<sub>1</sub>, and a group of ''M''<sub>2</sub> equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I''<sub>2</sub>, the number of lines expected is (2''M''<sub>1</sub>''I''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+ 1) (2''M''<sub>2</sub>''I''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ 1). As an example, the methoxymethyl radical, H<sub>2</sub>C(OCH<sub>3</sub>), has two equivalent <sup>1</sup>H nuclei, each with ''I''&nbsp;= 1/2 and three equivalent <sup>1</sup>H nuclei each with ''I''&nbsp;= 1/2, and so the number of lines expected is (2''M''<sub>1</sub>''I''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+ 1) (2''M''<sub>2</sub>''I''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ 1) = [2(2)(1/2) + 1] [2(3)(1/2) + 1] = 3\u00d74 = 12, again as observed.\n[[File:EPR methyl.png|thumb|right|300px|Simulated EPR spectrum of the CH<sub>3</sub> radical]]\n* The above can be extended to predict the number of lines for any number of nuclei.\n\nWhile it is easy to predict the number of lines, the reverse problem, unraveling a complex multi-line EPR spectrum and assigning the various spacings to specific nuclei, is more difficult.\n\nIn the often encountered case of ''I''&nbsp;= 1/2 nuclei (e.g., <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P), the line intensities produced by a population of radicals, each possessing ''M'' equivalent nuclei, will follow [[Pascal's triangle]]. For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three <sup>1</sup>H nuclei of the CH<sub>3</sub> radical give rise to 2''MI''&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 2(3)(1/2)&nbsp;+ 1&nbsp;= 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio. The line spacing gives a hyperfine coupling constant of ''a''<sub>H</sub> = 23 ''G'' for each of the three <sup>1</sup>H nuclei. Note again that the lines in this spectrum are ''first derivatives'' of absorptions.\n\n[[File:EPR methoxymethyl.png|thumb|right|300px|Simulated EPR spectrum of the H<sub>2</sub>C(OCH<sub>3</sub>) radical]]\nAs a second example, the methoxymethyl radical, H<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub><sup>'''.'''</sup> the OC''H''<sub>2</sub> center will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component of which is further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3\u00d74&nbsp;= 12 lines, a triplet of quartets. A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities. Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller line spacing) is due to the three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron. It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's unpaired electron, but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>).\n\n=== Resonance linewidth definition ===\nResonance linewidths are defined in terms of the magnetic induction ''B'' and its corresponding units, and are measured along the ''x'' axis of an EPR spectrum, from a line's center to a chosen reference point of the line. These defined widths are called [[spectroscopic line shape|halfwidths]] and possess some advantages: for asymmetric lines, values of left and right halfwidth can be given. The halfwidth <math>\\Delta B_h</math> is the distance measured from the line's center to the point in which [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] value has half of maximal absorption value in the center of [[resonance]] line. First inclination width <math>\\Delta B_{1/2}</math> is a distance from center of the line to the point of maximal absorption curve inclination. In practice, a full definition of linewidth is used. For symmetric lines, halfwidth <math>\\Delta B_{1/2} = 2\\Delta B_h</math>, and full inclination width <math>\\Delta B_\\text{max} = 2\\Delta B_{1s}</math>.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:ESR-STM at QNS in Ewha - front view.jpg|thumb|This low-temperature ESR-[[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] in the [[Center for Quantum Nanoscience]] is one of the first STMs globally to measure electron spin resonance on single atoms.]]\nEPR/ESR spectroscopy is used in various branches of science, such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], for the detection and identification of [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] and paramagnetic centers such as [[F-center]]s. EPR is a sensitive, specific method for studying both radicals formed in chemical reactions and the reactions themselves. For example, when ice (solid H<sub>2</sub>O) is decomposed by exposure to high-energy radiation, radicals such as H, OH, and HO<sub>2</sub> are produced. Such radicals can be identified and studied by EPR. Organic and inorganic radicals can be detected in electrochemical systems and in materials exposed to [[UV]] light. In many cases, the reactions to make the radicals and the subsequent reactions of the radicals are of interest, while in other cases EPR is used to provide information on a radical's geometry and the orbital of the unpaired electron. EPR/ESR spectroscopy is also used in geology and archaeology as a dating tool.

A second reason for widespread X and Q band measurements is that electromagnets can reliably generate fields up to about 1 tesla. However, the low spectral resolution over ''g''-factor at these wavebands limits the study of paramagnetic centers with comparatively low anisotropic magnetic parameters. Measurements at <math>\\nu</math> > 40&nbsp;GHz, in the millimeter wavelength region, offer the following advantages:\n\n[[File:EPR multifrequency spectra.png|thumb|400px|EPR spectra of TEMPO, a nitroxide radical, as a function of frequency.

Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control of the flow of microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.\n\nMost EPR spectrometers are reflection spectrometers, meaning that the detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation coming back from the cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the [[circulator]] which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.\n\n==== Reference arm ====\n\nAt low energies (less than 1 \u03bcW) the diode current is proportional to the microwave power and the detector is referred to as a [[square-law detector]]. At higher power levels (greater than 1&nbsp;mW) the diode current is proportional to the square root of the microwave power and the detector is called a linear detector. In order to obtain optimal sensitivity as well as quantitative information the diode should be operating within the linear region. To ensure the detector is operating at that level the reference arm serves to provide a \"bias\".\n\n=== Magnet ===\nIn an EPR spectrometer the magnetic assembly includes the magnet with a dedicated power supply as well as a field sensor or regulator such as a [[Hall effect sensor|Hall probe]]. EPR spectrometers use one of two types of magnet which is determined by the operating microwave frequency (which determine the range of magnetic field strengths required). The first is an electromagnet which are generally capable of generating field strengths of up to 1.5 T making them suitable for measurements using the Q-band frequency. In order to generate field strengths appropriate for W-band and higher frequency operation superconducting magnets are employed. The magnetic field is homogeneous across the sample volume and has a high stability at static field.\n\n=== Microwave resonator (cavity) ===\nThe microwave resonator is designed to enhance the microwave magnetic field at the sample in order to induce EPR transitions. It is a metal box with a rectangular or cylindrical shape that resonates with microwaves (like an organ pipe with sound waves). At the resonance frequency of the cavity microwaves remain inside the cavity and are not reflected back. Resonance means the cavity stores microwave energy and its ability to do this is given by the quality factor {{mvar|Q}}, defined by the following equation:\n\n<math>Q=\\frac {2\\pi(energy\\  stored)}{(energy\\ dissipated)}</math>\n\nThe higher the value of {{mvar|Q}} the higher the sensitivity of the spectrometer. The energy dissipated is the energy lost in one microwave period. Energy may be lost to the side walls of the cavity as microwaves may generate currents which in turn generate heat. A consequence of resonance is the creation of a standing wave inside the cavity. Electromagnetic standing waves have their electric and magnetic field components exactly out of phase. This provides an advantage as the electric field provides non-resonant absorption of the microwaves, which in turn increases the dissipated energy and reduces {{mvar|Q}}. To achieve the largest signals and hence sensitivity the sample is positioned such that it lies within the magnetic field maximum and the electric field minimum. When the magnetic field strength is such that an absorption event occurs, the value of {{mvar|Q}} will be reduced due to the extra energy loss. This results in a change of impedance which serves to stop the cavity from being critically coupled. This means microwaves will now be reflected back to the detector (in the microwave bridge) where an EPR signal is detected.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=Gareth R.|last2=Eaton|first2= Sandra S.|last3=Barr|first3= David P.|last4=Weber|first4= Ralph T. |name-list-format = vanc |title=Basics of Continuous Wave EPR|journal=Quantitative EPR|date=2010|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1007/978-3-211-92948-3_1 | isbn=978-3-211-92947-6}}</ref>\n\n== Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance ==\n{{details|Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance}}\n\nThe dynamics of electron spins are best studied with pulsed measurements.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Arthur | last1 = Schweiger | first2 = Gunnar | last2 = Jeschke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-19-850634-8 }}</ref> Microwave pulses typically 10\u2013100 ns long are used to control the spins in the [[Bloch sphere]].
