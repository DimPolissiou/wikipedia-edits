The [[Fire department|fire service]], also known in some countries as the fire brigade or [[fire department]], is one of the three main [[emergency service]]s. From [[urban area]]s to aboard [[ship]]s, firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world.\n\nThe skills required for safe operations are regularly practiced during training evaluations throughout a firefighter's career. Initial firefighting skills are normally taught through local, regional or state-approved fire academies or training courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publicsafetyelite.com/fire-academy/|title=Fire Academy|website=Public Safety Elite|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> Depending on the requirements of a department, additional skills and certifications such as technical rescue and pre-hospital medicine may also be acquired at this time.\n\nFirefighters work closely with other emergency response agencies such as the [[police]] and [[emergency medical service]]. A firefighter's role may overlap with both. [[Fire investigation|Fire investigators]] or [[fire marshal]]s investigate the cause of a fire. If the fire was caused by [[arson]] or [[negligence]], their work will overlap with law enforcement. Firefighters also frequently provide some degree of [[emergency medical service]], in addition to working with full-time [[paramedic]]s.\n\nThe basic tasks of firefighters include: fire suppression, rescue, fire prevention, basic first aid, and investigations. Firefighting is further broken down into skills which include: size-up, extinguishing, ventilation, search and rescue, salvage, containment, mop up and overhaul.\n\n==Duties==\n===Fire suppression===\n[[Image:Fire inside an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|Firefighters had to focus their efforts on saving the adjacent church instead of this burning building, an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada]]\n[[File:Firefighter ladder slide.jpg|thumb|Firefighter carrying out a ladder slide]]\nA fire burns due to the presence of three elements: [[fuel]], [[oxygen]] and heat. This is often referred to as the ''[[fire triangle]]''. Sometimes it is known as the ''[[fire tetrahedron]]'' if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction which can help sustain certain types of fire. The aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of at least one of those elements. Most commonly this is done by dousing the fire with water, though some fires require other methods such as foam or dry agents. Firefighters are equipped with a wide variety of equipment for this purpose that include: ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, fire hose, and [[fire extinguisher]]s.\n\n==== Structural firefighting ====\n:''See also [[:Category:Fire suppression|Fire suppression]] for other techniques.''\nWhile sometimes fires can be limited to small areas of a structure, wider collateral damage due to smoke, water and burning embers is common. Utility shutoff (such as gas and electricity) is typically an early priority for arriving fire crews. Specific procedures and equipment are needed at a property where hazardous materials are being used or stored.\n\n[[Structure fire]]s may be attacked with either \"interior\" or \"exterior\" resources, or both. Interior crews, using the \"[[two in, two out]]\" rule, may extend [[fire hose]] lines inside the building, find the fire and cool it with water. Exterior crews may direct water into windows and other openings, or against any nearby [[fuel]]s exposed to the initial fire. Hose streams directed into the interior through exterior wall apertures may conflict and jeopardize interior fire attack crews.\n\nBuildings that are made of flammable materials such as wood are different from building materials such as concrete. Generally, a \"fire-resistant\" building is designed to limit fire to a small area or floor. Other floors can be safe by preventing smoke inhalation and damage. All buildings suspected or on fire must be evacuated, regardless of fire rating.\n\nSome fire fighting tactics may appear to be destructive, but often serve specific needs. For example, during [[Ventilation (firefighting)|ventilation]] firefighters are forced to either open holes in the roof or floors of a structure (called vertical ventilation), or open windows and walls (called horizontal ventilation) to remove smoke and heated gases from the interior of the structure. Such ventilation methods are also used to improve interior visibility to locate victims more quickly. Ventilation helps to preserve the life of trapped or unconscious individuals as it releases the poisonous gases from inside the structure. Vertical ventilation is vital to firefighter safety in the event of a [[flashover]] or [[backdraft]] scenario. Releasing the flammable gases through the roof eliminates the possibility of a backdraft, and the removal of heat can reduce the possibility of a flashover. Flashovers, due to their intense heat (900\u20131200\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and explosive temperaments, are commonly fatal to firefighter personnel. Precautionary methods, such as smashing a window, reveal backdraft situations before the firefighter enters the structure and is met with the circumstance head-on. Firefighter safety is the number one priority.\n\nWhenever possible during a structural fire or flooding situation, property is moved into the middle of a room and covered with a salvage cover, a heavy cloth-like tarp. Various steps such as retrieving and protecting valuables found during suppression or overhaul, evacuating water, and boarding windows and roofs can divert or prevent post-fire runoff.\n\n====Wildland firefighting====\n{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}\n[[Wildfire]]s (known in Australia as [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]]) require a unique set of strategies and tactics. In many countries such as Australia and the United States, these duties are mostly carried out by local [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighters]]. Wildfires have some ecological role in allowing new plants to grow, therefore in some cases they will be left to burn.<ref>{{citation|title=Forest Fire in Canada|date=2008-06-05|url=http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143903/http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|url-status=dead|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=2009-05-01|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref> Priorities in fighting wildfires include preventing the loss of life and property.\n\n=== Rescue ===\n[[File:Extrication exercise (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A demonstration of a [[vehicle extrication]].]]\nFirefighters rescue people (and animals) from dangerous situations such as [[traffic collision|crashed vehicles]], [[Structural integrity and failure|structural collapses]], trench collapses, cave and tunnel emergencies, water and ice emergencies, elevator emergencies, energized electrical line emergencies, and industrial accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/firefighter|title=Firefighter job profile|publisher=Prospects.ac.uk}}</ref> In less common circumstances, Firefighters rescue victims from hazardous materials emergencies as well as steep cliffs, embankment and high rises - The latter is referred to as High Angle Rescue, or [[Rope rescue|Rope Rescue]]. Many fire departments, including most in the [[United Kingdom]], refer to themselves as a '''fire and rescue service''' for this reason. Large fire departments, such as the [[New York City Fire Department]] and [[London Fire Brigade]], have specialist teams for advanced technical rescue. As building fires have been in decline for many years in developed countries such as the [[United States]], rescues other than fires make up an increasing proportion of their firefighters' work.<ref name=\"Plenty\"/>\n\n===Emergency medical services===\nFirefighters frequently provide some degree of [[Emergency medicine|emergency medical care]]. In some jurisdictions [[first aid]] is the only medical training that firefighters have, and medical-only calls are the sole responsibility of a separate [[emergency medical services]] (EMS) agency. Elsewhere, it is common for firefighters to respond to medical-only calls. The impetus for this is the growing demand for emergency medicine and the decline of fires and traditional firefighting call-outs<ref name=\"Plenty\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/09/07/plenty-firefighters-but-where-are-fires/isCPrIPauX078UKHdixu0K/story.html|title=Plenty of firefighters, but where are the fires?|date=2013-09-07|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2017-09-22}}</ref>\u2014though fire departments still have to be able to respond to them\u2014and their existing ability to respond rapidly to emergencies. A rapid response is particularly necessary for [[cardiac arrest]]s, as these will lead to death if not treated within minutes.<ref name=NIH2016What>{{cite web|title=What Is Sudden Cardiac Arrest?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/scda|website=NHLBI|accessdate=16 August 2016|date=June 22, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728031608/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/scda|archivedate=28 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe dispatch of firefighters to medical emergencies is particularly common in fire departments that run the EMS, including most large cities of the United States. In those departments, firefighters are often jointly trained as [[emergency medical technician]]s in order to deliver [[basic life support]], and more rarely as [[paramedics]] to deliver [[advanced life support]]. In the United Kingdom, where fire services and EMS are run separately, [[Fire Service Co-Responder|fire service co-responding]] has been introduced more recently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|title=News|website=www.london-fire.gov.uk|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813185751/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Another point of variation is whether the firefighters respond in a fire engine or a [[Nontransporting EMS vehicle|response car]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-firefighters-called-300-medical-11295803|title=Surrey firefighters called to almost 300 medical emergencies during co-responding trial|publisher=[[Surrey Advertiser]]|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref> Either way, separate employees to crew [[ambulance]]s are still needed, unless the firefighters can work shifts on the ambulances.\n\n===Specialized roles===\n====Aircraft rescue & firefighting====\n{{Main|Aircraft rescue and firefighting}}\n[[Airport]]s employ specialist firefighters to deal with potential ground emergencies. Due to the mass casualty potential of an aviation emergency, the speed with which emergency response equipment and personnel arrive at the scene of the emergency is of paramount importance. When dealing with an emergency, the airport firefighters are tasked with rapidly securing the aircraft, its crew and its passengers from all hazards, particularly fire. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams, dry chemical and clean agents used to extinguish burning aviation fuel.\n\n====Hazardous materials====\n[[File:Decontamination after incident at Archway - geograph.org.uk - 108750.jpg|thumb|[[Decontamination]] after a chemical spill]]\nFire departments are usually the primary agency that responds to an emergency involving [[hazardous material]]s. Specialized firefighters, known as hazardous materials technicians, have training and certification in chemical identification, leak control, decontamination, and clean-up procedures.\n\n===Fire prevention===\n[[File:FiremanPaffandElmo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Firefighters frequently give fire prevention talks at schools and community events]]\n\nFire departments frequently provide advice to the public on how to prevent fires in the home and work-place environments. Fire inspectors or fire marshals will directly inspect businesses to ensure they are up to the current building [[fire code]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=5000|title=NFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code|website=National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)|accessdate=8 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iccsafe.org/codes-tech-support/codes/2018-i-codes/ifc/|title=Overview of the International Fire Code|website=International Code Council (ICC)|accessdate=8 July 2018|date=2015-03-20}}</ref> which are enforced so that a building can sufficiently resist fire spread, potential hazards are located, and to ensure that occupants can be safely evacuated, commensurate with the risks involved.\n\n[[fire sprinkler|Fire suppression systems]] have a proven record for controlling and extinguishing unwanted fires. Many fire officials recommend that every building, including residences, have [[fire sprinkler]] systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Campaigns/Fire-Sprinkler-Initiative/Legislation-and-adoptions/Sprinkler-requirements|title=NFPA Fire Sprinkler Initiative|website=National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)|accessdate=8 July 2018}}</ref> Correctly working sprinklers in a residence ''greatly'' reduce the risk of death from a fire.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.firehouse.com/home/article/12096404/research-shows-residential-sprinklers-save-lives|title=Research Shows Residential Sprinklers Save Lives|last1=Pollack|first1=Keshia|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018|publisher=SAGE Journal|last2=Frattaroli|first2=Shannon|issue=Fire and Worker Health and Safety|last3=Somers|first3=Scott}}</ref> With the small rooms typical of a residence, one or two sprinklers can cover most rooms.

This is normally accomplished in many innovative ways such as conducting presentations, distributing safety brochures, providing news articles, writing [[public safety announcement]]s (PSA) or establishing meaningful displays in well-visited areas. Ensuring that each household has working [[smoke alarm]]s, is educated in the proper techniques of fire safety, has an evacuation route and rendezvous point is of top priority in [[public education]] for most fire prevention teams in almost all fire department localities.\n\nFire investigators, who are experienced firefighters trained in fire cause determinism, are dispatched to fire scenes, in order to investigate and determine whether the fire was a result of an accident or intentional. Some fire investigators have full law enforcement powers to investigate and arrest suspected arsonists.\n\n==Occupational health and safety==\n===Direct risks===\n====Fires====\n[[File:Firemen's Monument, Boston by John A Wilson- far.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Firemen's Memorial (Boston)]] by [[John A. Wilson (sculptor)|John Wilson]]]]\n[[Image:Airport-firefighters-drill.jpg|thumb|right|Firefighters wearing [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] tackle an aircraft fire during a drill at [[Dyess Air Force Base]] in [[Abilene, Texas]]]]\nTo allow protection from the inherent risks of fighting fires, firefighters wear and carry protective and self-rescue equipment at all times. A [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA) delivers air to the firefighter through a [[full face mask]] and is worn to protect against [[smoke inhalation]], toxic fumes, and super heated gases. A special device called a [[PASS device|Personal Alert Safety System]] (PASS) is commonly worn independently or as a part of the SCBA to alert others when a firefighter stops moving for a specified period of time or manually operates the device. The PASS device sounds an alarm that can assist another firefighter ([[firefighter assist and search team]] (FAST), or [[rapid intervention team]] (RIT), in locating the firefighter in distress.\n\nFirefighters often carry personal self-rescue [[rope]]s. The ropes are generally 30 feet long and can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal rescue rope is cited in the deaths of two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |author=James Barron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/24/nyregion/3-firefighters-die-in-blazes-in-brooklyn-and-bronx.html |title=3 Firefighters Die in Blazes in Brooklyn and Bronx |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 24, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n[[Hyperthermia|Heat injury]] is a major issue for firefighters as they wear insulated clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders to the status of their people on the fire ground. Devices such as [[PASS device]] alert 10\u201320 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices<ref>Zephyr Technologies [http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html BioHarness BT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407031009/http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html |date=2010-04-07 }}</ref> are similar to technology developed for [[Future Force Warrior]] and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as they may not be able to make voice calls over their radio. Current [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iii/otm_iii_4.html |title=OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) - Section III: Chapter IV: Heat Stress |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>\n\nFirefighters are also at risk for developing [[rhabdomyolysis]]. Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue and has many causes including heat exposure, high core body temperature, and prolonged, intense exertion. Routine firefighter tasks, such as carrying extra weight of equipment and working in hot environments, can increase firefighters\u2019 risk for rhabdomyolysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What structural fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-133/pdfs/2018-133.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018133|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018133}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What wildland fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-131/pdfs/2018-131.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018131|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018131}}</ref>\n\n====Structural collapses====\nAnother leading cause of death during firefighting is [[structural collapse]] of a burning building (e.g. a wall, floor, ceiling, roof, or [[truss|truss system]]). Structural collapse, which often occurs without warning, may crush or trap firefighters inside the structure. To avoid loss of life, all on-duty firefighters should maintain two-way communication with the [[incident commander]] and be equipped with a [[PASS device|personal alert safety system device]] on all fire scenes and maintain radio communication on all incidents(PASS).<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/99-146.html Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Fire Fighters due to Structural Collapse].

May 2005.</ref> [[Francis Brannigan]] was the founder and greatest contributor to this element of firefighter safety.\n\n====Traffic collisions====\nIn the United States, 25% of fatalities of firefighters are caused by [[traffic collision]]s while responding to or returning from an incident. Other firefighters have been injured or killed by vehicles at the scene of a fire or emergency (Paulison 2005). A common measure fire departments have taken to prevent this is to require firefighters to wear a bright yellow reflective vest over their turnout coats if they have to work on a public road, to make them more visible to passing drivers.<ref>Federal Highway Administration DOT 23CFR634 Worker Visibility</ref> In addition to the direct dangers of firefighting, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 45% of on duty firefighter deaths.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The New England Journal of Medicine\", March 22, 2007, Accessed:July 17, 2011 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=12 |pages=1207\u20131215 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa060357 |pmid=17377158 |year = 2007|last1 = Kales|first1 = Stefanos N.|last2=Soteriades |first2=Elpidoforos S. |last3=Christophi |first3=Costas A. |last4=Christiani |first4=David C. |citeseerx=10.1.1.495.4530 }}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nFirefighters have sometimes been assaulted by members of the public while responding to calls. These kinds of attacks can cause firefighters to fear for their safety and may cause them to not have full focus on the situation which could result in injury to their selves or the patient.\n\n===Long-term risks===\n====Cardiovascular disease====\nFirefighting has long been associated with poor [[cardiovascular]] outcomes. In the United States, the most common cause of on-duty fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. In addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to [[coronary artery disease]] or other [[cardiovascular disease]]s, occupational exposures can significantly increase a firefighter's risk. Historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. However, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. For instance, [[carbon monoxide]], present in nearly all fire environments, and [[hydrogen cyanide]], formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. The substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. [[hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] can then lead to heart injury. In addition, chronic exposure to [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] in smoke is associated with [[atherosclerosis]]. Noise exposures may contribute to [[hypertension]] and possibly ischemic heart disease. Other factors associated with firefighting, such as [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[heat stress]], and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-133 Preventing Fire Fighter Fatalities Due to Heart Attacks and Other Sudden Cardiovascular Events.] July 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring fire suppression activities a firefighter can reach peak or near peak heart rates which can act as a trigger for a cardiac event. For example, [[tachycardia]] can cause plaque buildup to break loose and lodge itself is a small part of the heart causing [[myocardial infarction]], also known as a heart attack. This along with unhealthy habits and lack of exercise can be very hazardous to firefighter health.<ref>[University of Illinois] https://www.fsi.illinois.edu/documents{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} /research/CardioChemRisksModernFF_InterimReport2016.pdf</ref>\n\n====Cancer====\n[[File:Sailors participate in a fire drill exercise aboard USS Bainbridge (DDG 96). (40730256683).jpg|thumb|Smoke can expose firefighters to a variety of carcinogens]]\nA 2015 retrospective [[longitudinal study]] showed that firefighters are at higher risk for certain types of [[cancer]]. Firefighters had [[mesothelioma]], which is caused by [[asbestos]] exposure, at twice the rate of the non-firefighting working population.

In urban areas, this means that full-time paid firefighters usually have [[shift work]], with some providing cover each night. On the other hand, it may not be practical to employ full-time firefighters in villages and isolated small towns, where their services may not be required for days at a time. For this reason, many fire departments have firefighters who spend long periods on call to respond to infrequent emergencies; they may have regular jobs outside of firefighting. Whether they are paid or not varies by country. In the United States and Germany, [[volunteer fire department]]s provide most of the cover in rural areas. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, by contrast, actual volunteers are rare. Instead, \"[[retained firefighter]]s\" are paid for responding to incidents, along with a small salary for spending long periods of time on call.\n\n==Firefighting around the world==\n{{Further|Firefighting worldwide}}\n[[File:BSPP section Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] is a [[French Army]] unit which serves as the fire service for [[Paris]] and certain sites of national strategic importance.]]\n[[File:mtlfirechiefs.jpg|thumb|250px|Firefighters tackling a blaze in [[Montreal, Canada]]]]\nA key difference between many country's fire services is what the balance is between full-time and volunteer (or on-call) firefighters. In the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], large metropolitan fire departments are almost entirely made up of full-time firefighters. On the other hand, in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]],<ref>[http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 \u00d6sterreichischer Bundesfeuerwehrverband: Statistik des \u00d6BFV<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228111522/http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 |date=2008-12-28 }}</ref> volunteers play a substantial role even in the largest fire departments, including Berlin's, which serves a population of 3.6 million. Regardless of how this balance works, a common feature is that smaller urban areas have a mix of full-time and volunteer/on-call firefighters. This is known in the United States as a [[combination fire department]]. In [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], all firefighters are volunteers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-27186801|title=Chile's firefighters in spotlight after Valparaiso blaze |date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2019-07-17|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nAnother point of variation is how the fire services are organized. Some countries like [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]] have a single national fire service. Others like Australia, the United Kingdom and France organize fire services based on regions or sub-national states. In the United States, Germany and [[Canada]], fire departments are run at a municipal level.\n\nAtypically, [[Singapore]] and many parts of [[Switzerland]] have [[Compulsory Fire Service|fire service conscription]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128134257/http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |archive-date=2018-01-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |title=SCDF Website - GENERAL: About Us |access-date=2018-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228102845/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |archive-date=2016-12-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Germany, conscription can also be used if a village does not have a functioning fire service. Other unusual arrangements are seen in France, where two of the country's fire services (the [[Paris Fire Brigade]] and the [[Marseille Naval Fire Battalion]]) are part of the armed forces, and [[Denmark]], where most fire services are run by private companies.<ref name=\"fe-2008\"/>\n\nAnother way in which a firefighter's work varies around the world is the nature of firefighting equipment and tactics. For example, American fire departments make heavier use of [[Fire engine#Aerial apparatus|aerial appliances]], and are often split between engine and ladder companies. In Europe, where the size and usefulness of aerial appliances are often limited by narrow streets, they are only used for rescues, and firefighters can rotate between working on an engine and an aerial appliance.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fireapparatusmagazine.com/articles/print/volume-21/issue-6/features/fire-apparatus-united-states-vs-europe.html|title=United States vs. Europe|publisher=Fire Apparatus|date=2016-06-07|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref><ref name=\"fe-2008\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2008/06/fire-commentary-european-firefighting-operations.html|title=Fire Commentary: European Firefighting Operations|publisher=Fire Engineering|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref> A final point in variation is how involved firefighters are in [[emergency medical services]].\n\n==Communication and command structure==\n[[Image:NSWFB112.jpg|thumb|[[Fire and Rescue NSW|New South Wales Fire Brigade]] station officer (red helmet) and firefighters (yellow helmets), Australia]]\n\nThe expedient and accurate handling of fire alarms or calls are significant factors in the successful outcome of any incident. Fire department communications play a critical role in that successful outcome. Fire department communications include the methods by which the public can notify the communications center of an emergency, the methods by which the center can notify the proper fire fighting forces, and the methods by which information is exchanged at the scene. One method is to use a [[megaphone]] to communicate.\n\nA telecommunicator (often referred to as a [[000 Operator]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} has a role different from but just as important as other emergency personnel. The telecommunicator must process calls from unknown and unseen individuals, usually calling under stressful conditions. He/she must be able to obtain complete, reliable information from the caller and prioritize requests for assistance. It is the dispatcher's responsibility to bring order to chaos.\n\nWhile some fire departments are large enough to utilize their own telecommunication dispatcher, most rural and small areas rely on a central dispatcher to provide handling of fire, rescue, and police services.\n\nFirefighters are trained to use [[Telecommunication|communications]] equipment to receive alarms, give and receive commands, request assistance, and report on conditions. Since firefighters from different agencies routinely provide mutual aid to each other, and routinely operate at incidents where other emergency services are present, it is essential to have structures in place to establish a unified chain of command, and share information between agencies. The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has established a National Incident Management System.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/NIMS_core.pdf]</ref> One component of this system is the [[Incident Command System]].\n\nAll [[radio communication]] in the United States is under authorization from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC); as such, fire departments that operate radio equipment must have radio licenses from the FCC.\n\n[[Ten codes]] were popular in the early days of radio equipment because of poor transmission and reception. Advances in modern radio technology have reduced the need for ten-codes and many departments have converted to simple English (clear text).\n\n===Ranks===\nMany firefighters are sworn members with command structures similar to the [[military]] and [[police]]. They do not have general [[Police|police powers]] (some firefighters in the [[United States]] have limited police powers, like [[fire police]] departments, while certain [[fire marshal]]s have full police powers, i.e. the ability to make warrantless arrests, and authority to carry a firearm on and off-duty), but have specific powers of enforcement and control in fire and emergency situations.\n\nThe basic unit of an American fire department is a \"company\", a group of firefighters who typically work on the same engine. A \"crew\" or \"platoon\" is a subdivision of a company who work on the same shift. Commonwealth fire services are more likely to be organized around a \"watch\", who work the same shift on multiple engines.<ref>[http://www.humbersidefire.gov.uk/careers/becoming-a-firefighter/shift-patterns Humberside Fire and Rescue Service: Shift patterns]</ref>\n\n====Australia====\nNew South Wales Rural Fire Service\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Additionally, in the volunteer fire departments, there is a difference between a rank and an official position. This is founded on the military traditions of the fire departments. Every firefighter can hold a high rank without having an official position. A firefighter can be promoted by years of service, training skills and qualifications. Official positions are partly elected or given by capabilities. These conditions allow that older ordinary firefighters have higher ranks than their leaders. But through this ranks are no authorities given ([[Brevet (military)|Brevet]]).\n\n;Professional Fire Fighters (Middle Technical Grades) of [[Rheinland-Pfalz]]\nCompleted vocational training in a technical occupation suitable for the fire service.

It is part of the Ministry of Interior's Department of Firefighters, Public Rescue and Public Protection. The CNVVF task is to provide safety for people, animals and property, and control the compliance of buildings and industries to fire safety rules. The Ministry of the Interior, through the CNVVF, adopts fire safety rules with ministerial decrees or other lower rank documents. The CNVVF also ensures public rescue in emergencies that involves the use of chemical weapons, bacteriological, radiological and materials.

In general, white helmets denote chief officers, while red helmets may denote company officers, but the specific meaning of a helmet's color or style varies from region to region and department to department. The rank of an officer in an American fire department is most commonly denoted by a number of [[speaking trumpet]]s, a reference to a [[megaphone]]-like device used in the early days of the fire service, although typically called \"[[bugle]]\" in today's parlance. Ranks proceed from one (lieutenant) to five (fire chief) bugles. Traditional ranks in American fire departments that exist but may not always be utilized in all cities or towns include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Firefighter'''\n::no bugles\n| '''Engineer/Technician/Sergeant'''\n::3 chevrons\n| '''Lieutenant'''\n::1 bugle\n|-\n| '''Captain'''\n::2 either traditionally side by side\n::or less usually crossed bugles\n| '''Battalion Chief/District Chief'''\n::2 either side by side\n::or more traditionally crossed bugles\n| '''Division Chief or Assistant /Deputy Asst.'''\n'''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::3 crossed bugles\n|-\n| '''Deputy Chief/Commissioner'''\n::4 crossed bugles\n| '''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::5 crossed bugles\n|\n|}\nIn many fire departments in the U.S., the captain is commonly the commander of a company and a lieutenant is the supervisor of the company's firefighters on shift. There is no state or federal rank structure for firefighters and each municipality or volunteer fire department creates and uses their own unique structure.\n\nStill, some other American fire departments such the FDNY use military rank insignia in addition or instead of the traditional bugles. Additionally, officers on [[Glossary of firefighting#T|truck companies]] have been known to use rank insignias shaped like axes for Lieutenants (1) and Captains (2).\n\n==Firefighter equipment==\n{{Main|Glossary of firefighting equipment}}\n<!-- Before you add anything else to this list, ask yourself \"Do many or most firefighters use this piece of equipment in a way that's notable, verifiable, and of interest to the general audience?\" If not, consider just adding it to the glossary of equipment article instead. -->\n<gallery>\nFile:TurkishFirefighterMOPP4.jpeg|Turkish firefighters in [[MOPP (protective gear)|MOPP]] 4 level protective gear during an exercise held at [[Incirlik Air Base]], [[Turkey]]\nFile:TFS fire equipment.jpg|[[Toronto Fire Services|Toronto firefighters]] prepare their equipment\nFile:03262012Demonstraciones_rescate_erum_fabian_acu\u00f1a137.JPG|A firefighter using a hydraulic cutter during a demonstration\nFile:Aa RN firefighter 01.jpg|[[Royal Navy|British naval men]] in firefighting gear on [[HMS Illustrious (R06)]], [[Liverpool]], 25 October 2009\n</gallery>\nA partial list of some equipment typically used by firefighters:\n* Hand tools, such as\n** Flat-head and pick-head [[axe]]\n** [[Pike pole]]\n** [[Halligan bar]]\n** [[Flashlight]]\n** [[Spanner wrench]]\n** Circular (\"K-12\"), Cutters Edge and chain saws\n** [[Hydraulic rescue tools]] such as spreaders, cutters, and rams\n* [[Personal protective equipment]] (\"PPE\") designed to withstand water and high temperatures, such as\n** [[Bunker gear]], including turnout jacket and pants\n** [[SCBA|Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)]]\n** Helmet, face mask and visor; climbing helmets\n** [[Safety boots]], gloves, and [[Nomex]] and Carbon flash hoods\n** [[PASS device|Personal alert safety system (PASS) device]]\n* Handheld radio, pager, or other communication devices\n* [[Thermal imaging camera (firefighting)|Thermal imaging camera]]\n* [[Gas detector]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of firefighting}}\n[[Image:Old firefighters.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of American firefighters in the 1770s]]\n[[File:Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm.jpg|thumb|Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Photograph taken by W.J. Carpenter in 1910.]]\n\nAlthough people have fought fires since there have been valuable things to burn, the first instance of organized professionals combating structural fires occurred in Ancient [[Egypt]]. Likewise, fire fighters of the [[Roman Republic]] existed solely as privately organized and funded groups that operated more similarly to a business than a public service; however, during the [[Principate]] period [[Augustus]] revolutionized firefighting by calling for the creation of a fire guard that was trained, paid, and equipped by the state- the first truly public and professional firefighting service. Known as the [[Vigiles]], they were organised into cohorts and also served as a night watch and city police force.\n\nThe earliest American fire departments were volunteers, including the volunteer fire company in [[New Amsterdam]], now known as [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Essentials of Firefighting</ref> Fire companies were composed of citizens who volunteered their time to help protect the community. As time progressed and new towns popped up throughout the region there was a sharp increase in the number of volunteer departments. The first career fire department was not established in the United States until 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio ([[Cincinnati Fire & EMS Department]]). Many large cities began establishing paid, full-time, staff in order to try facilitate greater fire-related call volume. St. Louis Fire Department followed Cincinnati four years later and became the second established career fire department in the country followed by other large cities like New York ([[FDNY]]). City fire departments draw their funding directly from city taxes and share the same budget as other public works like the police department and trash services. Aside from big city fire departments, many populated suburbs and towns have career fire departments. The primary difference between a municipality department and a City department is the funding. Municipal fire departments do not share their budget with any other service and are considered to be private entities within a jurisdiction. This means that they have their own taxes that feed into their budgeting needs. Another main difference is the structure of the department. City fire departments have the mayor at the top of the chain whereas municipal departments have elected board officials who help maintain and run the department along with the chief officer staff.\n\n==Fundraisers==\nFunds for fire-fighting equipment may be raised by the firefighters themselves, especially in the case of volunteer organizations. Events such as pancake breakfasts and chili feeds are common in the US. Social events are also used to raise money, including dances, community fairs and car washes.\n\n==Notable firefighters==\n{{Globalize|section|datej=December 2012|date=March 2020}}\n* [[James Braidwood (firefighter)]] (1800\u20131861), founder of the municipal fire brigade in Edinburgh, 1824\n* [[John Decker (fire chief)|John Decker]] (1823\u20131892), chief of the New York City department during the 1863 draft riots\n* [[Ra\u00fal G\u00e1ndara-Cartagena]] (1895\u20131989), first and kilongest-serving Puerto Rico commonwealth fire chief\n* [[James J.

The [[Fire department|fire service]], also known in some countries as the fire brigade or [[fire department]], is one of the three main [[emergency service]]s. From [[urban area]]s to aboard [[ship]]s, firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world.\n\nThe skills required for safe operations are regularly practiced during training evaluations throughout a firefighter's career. Initial firefighting skills are normally taught through local, regional or state-approved fire academies or training courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publicsafetyelite.com/fire-academy/|title=Fire Academy|website=Public Safety Elite|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> Depending on the requirements of a department, additional skills and certifications such as technical rescue and pre-hospital medicine may also be acquired at this time.\n\nFirefighters work closely with other emergency response agencies such as the [[police]] and [[emergency medical service]]. A firefighter's role may overlap with both. [[Fire investigation|Fire investigators]] or [[fire marshal]]s investigate the cause of a fire. If the fire was caused by [[arson]] or [[negligence]], their work will overlap with law enforcement. Firefighters also frequently provide some degree of [[emergency medical service]], in addition to working with full-time [[paramedic]]s.\n\nThe basic tasks of firefighters include: fire suppression, rescue, fire prevention, basic first aid, and investigations. Firefighting is further broken down into skills which include: size-up, extinguishing, ventilation, search and rescue, salvage, containment, mop up and overhaul.\n\n==Duties==\n===Fire suppression===\n[[Image:Fire inside an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|Firefighters had to focus their efforts on saving the adjacent church instead of this burning building, an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada]]\n[[File:Firefighter ladder slide.jpg|thumb|Firefighter carrying out a ladder slide]]\nA fire burns due to the presence of three elements: [[fuel]], [[oxygen]] and heat. This is often referred to as the ''[[fire triangle]]''. Sometimes it is known as the ''[[fire tetrahedron]]'' if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction which can help sustain certain types of fire. The aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of at least one of those elements. Most commonly this is done by dousing the fire with water, though some fires require other methods such as foam or dry agents. Firefighters are equipped with a wide variety of equipment for this purpose that include: ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, fire hose, and [[fire extinguisher]]s.\n\n==== Structural firefighting ====\n:''See also [[:Category:Fire suppression|Fire suppression]] for other techniques.''\nWhile sometimes fires can be limited to small areas of a structure, wider collateral damage due to smoke, water and burning embers is common. Utility shutoff (such as gas and electricity) is typically an early priority for arriving fire crews. Specific procedures and equipment are needed at a property where hazardous materials are being used or stored.\n\n[[Structure fire]]s may be attacked with either \"interior\" or \"exterior\" resources, or both. Interior crews, using the \"[[two in, two out]]\" rule, may extend [[fire hose]] lines inside the building, find the fire and cool it with water. Exterior crews may direct water into windows and other openings, or against any nearby [[fuel]]s exposed to the initial fire. Hose streams directed into the interior through exterior wall apertures may conflict and jeopardize interior fire attack crews.\n\nBuildings that are made of flammable materials such as wood are different from building materials such as concrete. Generally, a \"fire-resistant\" building is designed to limit fire to a small area or floor. Other floors can be safe by preventing smoke inhalation and damage. All buildings suspected or on fire must be evacuated, regardless of fire rating.\n\nSome fire fighting tactics may appear to be destructive, but often serve specific needs. For example, during [[Ventilation (firefighting)|ventilation]] firefighters are forced to either open holes in the roof or floors of a structure (called vertical ventilation), or open windows and walls (called horizontal ventilation) to remove smoke and heated gases from the interior of the structure. Such ventilation methods are also used to improve interior visibility to locate victims more quickly. Ventilation helps to preserve the life of trapped or unconscious individuals as it releases the poisonous gases from inside the structure. Vertical ventilation is vital to firefighter safety in the event of a [[flashover]] or [[backdraft]] scenario. Releasing the flammable gases through the roof eliminates the possibility of a backdraft, and the removal of heat can reduce the possibility of a flashover. Flashovers, due to their intense heat (900\u20131200\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and explosive temperaments, are commonly fatal to firefighter personnel. Precautionary methods, such as smashing a window, reveal backdraft situations before the firefighter enters the structure and is met with the circumstance head-on. Firefighter safety is the number one priority.\n\nWhenever possible during a structural fire or flooding situation, property is moved into the middle of a room and covered with a salvage cover, a heavy cloth-like tarp. Various steps such as retrieving and protecting valuables found during suppression or overhaul, evacuating water, and boarding windows and roofs can divert or prevent post-fire runoff.\n\n====Wildland firefighting====\n{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}\n[[Wildfire]]s (known in Australia as [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]]) require a unique set of strategies and tactics. In many countries such as Australia and the United States, these duties are mostly carried out by local [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighters]]. Wildfires have some ecological role in allowing new plants to grow, therefore in some cases they will be left to burn.<ref>{{citation|title=Forest Fire in Canada|date=2008-06-05|url=http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143903/http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|url-status=dead|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=2009-05-01|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref> Priorities in fighting wildfires include preventing the loss of life and property.\n\n=== Rescue ===\n[[File:Extrication exercise (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A demonstration of a [[vehicle extrication]].]]\nFirefighters rescue people (and animals) from dangerous situations such as [[traffic collision|crashed vehicles]], [[Structural integrity and failure|structural collapses]], trench collapses, cave and tunnel emergencies, water and ice emergencies, elevator emergencies, energized electrical line emergencies, and industrial accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/firefighter|title=Firefighter job profile|publisher=Prospects.ac.uk}}</ref> In less common circumstances, Firefighters rescue victims from hazardous materials emergencies as well as steep cliffs, embankment and high rises - The latter is referred to as High Angle Rescue, or [[Rope rescue|Rope Rescue]]. Many fire departments, including most in the [[United Kingdom]], refer to themselves as a '''fire and rescue service''' for this reason. Large fire departments, such as the [[New York City Fire Department]] and [[London Fire Brigade]], have specialist teams for advanced technical rescue. As building fires have been in decline for many years in developed countries such as the [[United States]], rescues other than fires make up an increasing proportion of their firefighters' work.<ref name=\"Plenty\"/>\n\n===Emergency medical services===\nFirefighters frequently provide some degree of [[Emergency medicine|emergency medical care]]. In some jurisdictions [[first aid]] is the only medical training that firefighters have, and medical-only calls are the sole responsibility of a separate [[emergency medical services]] (EMS) agency. Elsewhere, it is common for firefighters to respond to medical-only calls. The impetus for this is the growing demand for emergency medicine and the decline of fires and traditional firefighting call-outs<ref name=\"Plenty\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/09/07/plenty-firefighters-but-where-are-fires/isCPrIPauX078UKHdixu0K/story.html|title=Plenty of firefighters, but where are the fires?|date=2013-09-07|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2017-09-22}}</ref>\u2014though fire departments still have to be able to respond to them\u2014and their existing ability to respond rapidly to emergencies.

In those departments, firefighters are often jointly trained as [[emergency medical technician]]s in order to deliver [[basic life support]], and more rarely as [[paramedics]] to deliver [[advanced life support]]. In the United Kingdom, where fire services and EMS are run separately, [[Fire Service Co-Responder|fire service co-responding]] has been introduced more recently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|title=News|website=www.london-fire.gov.uk|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813185751/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Another point of variation is whether the firefighters respond in a fire engine or a [[Nontransporting EMS vehicle|response car]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-firefighters-called-300-medical-11295803|title=Surrey firefighters called to almost 300 medical emergencies during co-responding trial|publisher=[[Surrey Advertiser]]|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref> Either way, separate employees to crew [[ambulance]]s are still needed, unless the firefighters can work shifts on the ambulances.\n\n===Specialized roles===\n====Aircraft rescue & firefighting====\n{{Main|Aircraft rescue and firefighting}}\n[[Airport]]s employ specialist firefighters to deal with potential ground emergencies. Due to the mass casualty potential of an aviation emergency, the speed with which emergency response equipment and personnel arrive at the scene of the emergency is of paramount importance. When dealing with an emergency, the airport firefighters are tasked with rapidly securing the aircraft, its crew and its passengers from all hazards, particularly fire. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams, dry chemical and clean agents used to extinguish burning aviation fuel.\n\n====Hazardous materials====\n[[File:Decontamination after incident at Archway - geograph.org.uk - 108750.jpg|thumb|[[Decontamination]] after a chemical spill]]\nFire departments are usually the primary agency that responds to an emergency involving [[hazardous material]]s. Specialized firefighters, known as hazardous materials technicians, have training and certification in chemical identification, leak control, decontamination, and clean-up procedures.\n\n===Fire prevention===\n[[File:FiremanPaffandElmo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Firefighters frequently give fire prevention talks at schools and community events]]\n\nFire departments frequently provide advice to the public on how to prevent fires in the home and work-place environments.

Many fire officials recommend that every building, including residences, have [[fire sprinkler]] systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Campaigns/Fire-Sprinkler-Initiative/Legislation-and-adoptions/Sprinkler-requirements|title=NFPA Fire Sprinkler Initiative|website=National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)|accessdate=8 July 2018}}</ref> Correctly working sprinklers in a residence ''greatly'' reduce the risk of death from a fire.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.firehouse.com/home/article/12096404/research-shows-residential-sprinklers-save-lives|title=Research Shows Residential Sprinklers Save Lives|last1=Pollack|first1=Keshia|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018|publisher=SAGE Journal|last2=Frattaroli|first2=Shannon|issue=Fire and Worker Health and Safety|last3=Somers|first3=Scott}}</ref> With the small rooms typical of a residence, one or two sprinklers can cover most rooms.

This is normally accomplished in many innovative ways such as conducting presentations, distributing safety brochures, providing news articles, writing [[public safety announcement]]s (PSA) or establishing meaningful displays in well-visited areas. Ensuring that each household has working [[smoke alarm]]s, is educated in the proper techniques of fire safety, has an evacuation route and rendezvous point is of top priority in [[public education]] for most fire prevention teams in almost all fire department localities.\n\nFire investigators, who are experienced firefighters trained in fire cause determinism, are dispatched to fire scenes, in order to investigate and determine whether the fire was a result of an accident or intentional. Some fire investigators have full law enforcement powers to investigate and arrest suspected arsonists.\n\n==Occupational health and safety==\n===Direct risks===\n====Fires====\n[[File:Firemen's Monument, Boston by John A Wilson- far.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Firemen's Memorial (Boston)]] by [[John A. Wilson (sculptor)|John Wilson]]]]\n[[Image:Airport-firefighters-drill.jpg|thumb|right|Firefighters wearing [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] tackle an aircraft fire during a drill at [[Dyess Air Force Base]] in [[Abilene, Texas]]]]\nTo allow protection from the inherent risks of fighting fires, firefighters wear and carry protective and self-rescue equipment at all times. A [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA) delivers air to the firefighter through a [[full face mask]] and is worn to protect against [[smoke inhalation]], toxic fumes, and super heated gases. A special device called a [[PASS device|Personal Alert Safety System]] (PASS) is commonly worn independently or as a part of the SCBA to alert others when a firefighter stops moving for a specified period of time or manually operates the device. The PASS device sounds an alarm that can assist another firefighter ([[firefighter assist and search team]] (FAST), or [[rapid intervention team]] (RIT), in locating the firefighter in distress.\n\nFirefighters often carry personal self-rescue [[rope]]s. The ropes are generally 30 feet long and can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal rescue rope is cited in the deaths of two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |author=James Barron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/24/nyregion/3-firefighters-die-in-blazes-in-brooklyn-and-bronx.html |title=3 Firefighters Die in Blazes in Brooklyn and Bronx |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 24, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n[[Hyperthermia|Heat injury]] is a major issue for firefighters as they wear insulated clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders to the status of their people on the fire ground. Devices such as [[PASS device]] alert 10\u201320 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices<ref>Zephyr Technologies [http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html BioHarness BT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407031009/http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html |date=2010-04-07 }}</ref> are similar to technology developed for [[Future Force Warrior]] and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as they may not be able to make voice calls over their radio.

Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue and has many causes including heat exposure, high core body temperature, and prolonged, intense exertion. Routine firefighter tasks, such as carrying extra weight of equipment and working in hot environments, can increase firefighters\u2019 risk for rhabdomyolysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What structural fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-133/pdfs/2018-133.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018133|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018133}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What wildland fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-131/pdfs/2018-131.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018131|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018131}}</ref>\n\n====Structural collapses====\nAnother leading cause of death during firefighting is [[structural collapse]] of a burning building (e.g. a wall, floor, ceiling, roof, or [[truss|truss system]]). Structural collapse, which often occurs without warning, may crush or trap firefighters inside the structure. To avoid loss of life, all on-duty firefighters should maintain two-way communication with the [[incident commander]] and be equipped with a [[PASS device|personal alert safety system device]] on all fire scenes and maintain radio communication on all incidents(PASS).<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/99-146.html Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Fire Fighters due to Structural Collapse].

May 2005.</ref> [[Francis Brannigan]] was the founder and greatest contributor to this element of firefighter safety.\n\n====Traffic collisions====\nIn the United States, 25% of fatalities of firefighters are caused by [[traffic collision]]s while responding to or returning from an incident. Other firefighters have been injured or killed by vehicles at the scene of a fire or emergency (Paulison 2005). A common measure fire departments have taken to prevent this is to require firefighters to wear a bright yellow reflective vest over their turnout coats if they have to work on a public road, to make them more visible to passing drivers.<ref>Federal Highway Administration DOT 23CFR634 Worker Visibility</ref> In addition to the direct dangers of firefighting, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 45% of on duty firefighter deaths.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The New England Journal of Medicine\", March 22, 2007, Accessed:July 17, 2011 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=12 |pages=1207\u20131215 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa060357 |pmid=17377158 |year = 2007|last1 = Kales|first1 = Stefanos N.|last2=Soteriades |first2=Elpidoforos S. |last3=Christophi |first3=Costas A. |last4=Christiani |first4=David C. |citeseerx=10.1.1.495.4530 }}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nFirefighters have sometimes been assaulted by members of the public while responding to calls. These kinds of attacks can cause firefighters to fear for their safety and may cause them to not have full focus on the situation which could result in injury to their selves or the patient.\n\n===Long-term risks===\n====Cardiovascular disease====\nFirefighting has long been associated with poor [[cardiovascular]] outcomes. In the United States, the most common cause of on-duty fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. In addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to [[coronary artery disease]] or other [[cardiovascular disease]]s, occupational exposures can significantly increase a firefighter's risk. Historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. However, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. For instance, [[carbon monoxide]], present in nearly all fire environments, and [[hydrogen cyanide]], formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. The substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. [[hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] can then lead to heart injury. In addition, chronic exposure to [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] in smoke is associated with [[atherosclerosis]]. Noise exposures may contribute to [[hypertension]] and possibly ischemic heart disease. Other factors associated with firefighting, such as [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[heat stress]], and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-133 Preventing Fire Fighter Fatalities Due to Heart Attacks and Other Sudden Cardiovascular Events.] July 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring fire suppression activities a firefighter can reach peak or near peak heart rates which can act as a trigger for a cardiac event. For example, [[tachycardia]] can cause plaque buildup to break loose and lodge itself is a small part of the heart causing [[myocardial infarction]], also known as a heart attack. This along with unhealthy habits and lack of exercise can be very hazardous to firefighter health.<ref>[University of Illinois] https://www.fsi.illinois.edu/documents{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} /research/CardioChemRisksModernFF_InterimReport2016.pdf</ref>\n\n====Cancer====\n[[File:Sailors participate in a fire drill exercise aboard USS Bainbridge (DDG 96).

Firefighters had [[mesothelioma]], which is caused by [[asbestos]] exposure, at twice the rate of the non-firefighting working population. Younger firefighters (under age 65) also developed [[bladder cancer]] and [[prostate cancer]] at higher rates than the general population.

In urban areas, this means that full-time paid firefighters usually have [[shift work]], with some providing cover each night. On the other hand, it may not be practical to employ full-time firefighters in villages and isolated small towns, where their services may not be required for days at a time. For this reason, many fire departments have firefighters who spend long periods on call to respond to infrequent emergencies; they may have regular jobs outside of firefighting. Whether they are paid or not varies by country. In the United States and Germany, [[volunteer fire department]]s provide most of the cover in rural areas. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, by contrast, actual volunteers are rare. Instead, \"[[retained firefighter]]s\" are paid for responding to incidents, along with a small salary for spending long periods of time on call.\n\n==Firefighting around the world==\n{{Further|Firefighting worldwide}}\n[[File:BSPP section Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] is a [[French Army]] unit which serves as the fire service for [[Paris]] and certain sites of national strategic importance.]]\n[[File:mtlfirechiefs.jpg|thumb|250px|Firefighters tackling a blaze in [[Montreal, Canada]]]]\nA key difference between many country's fire services is what the balance is between full-time and volunteer (or on-call) firefighters. In the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], large metropolitan fire departments are almost entirely made up of full-time firefighters. On the other hand, in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]],<ref>[http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 \u00d6sterreichischer Bundesfeuerwehrverband: Statistik des \u00d6BFV<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228111522/http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 |date=2008-12-28 }}</ref> volunteers play a substantial role even in the largest fire departments, including Berlin's, which serves a population of 3.6 million. Regardless of how this balance works, a common feature is that smaller urban areas have a mix of full-time and volunteer/on-call firefighters. This is known in the United States as a [[combination fire department]]. In [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], all firefighters are volunteers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-27186801|title=Chile's firefighters in spotlight after Valparaiso blaze |date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2019-07-17|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nAnother point of variation is how the fire services are organized. Some countries like [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]] have a single national fire service. Others like Australia, the United Kingdom and France organize fire services based on regions or sub-national states. In the United States, Germany and [[Canada]], fire departments are run at a municipal level.\n\nAtypically, [[Singapore]] and many parts of [[Switzerland]] have [[Compulsory Fire Service|fire service conscription]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128134257/http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |archive-date=2018-01-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |title=SCDF Website - GENERAL: About Us |access-date=2018-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228102845/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |archive-date=2016-12-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Germany, conscription can also be used if a village does not have a functioning fire service.

For example, American fire departments make heavier use of [[Fire engine#Aerial apparatus|aerial appliances]], and are often split between engine and ladder companies. In Europe, where the size and usefulness of aerial appliances are often limited by narrow streets, they are only used for rescues, and firefighters can rotate between working on an engine and an aerial appliance.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fireapparatusmagazine.com/articles/print/volume-21/issue-6/features/fire-apparatus-united-states-vs-europe.html|title=United States vs. Europe|publisher=Fire Apparatus|date=2016-06-07|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref><ref name=\"fe-2008\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2008/06/fire-commentary-european-firefighting-operations.html|title=Fire Commentary: European Firefighting Operations|publisher=Fire Engineering|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref> A final point in variation is how involved firefighters are in [[emergency medical services]].\n\n==Communication and command structure==\n[[Image:NSWFB112.jpg|thumb|[[Fire and Rescue NSW|New South Wales Fire Brigade]] station officer (red helmet) and firefighters (yellow helmets), Australia]]\n\nThe expedient and accurate handling of fire alarms or calls are significant factors in the successful outcome of any incident. Fire department communications play a critical role in that successful outcome. Fire department communications include the methods by which the public can notify the communications center of an emergency, the methods by which the center can notify the proper fire fighting forces, and the methods by which information is exchanged at the scene. One method is to use a [[megaphone]] to communicate.\n\nA telecommunicator (often referred to as a [[000 Operator]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} has a role different from but just as important as other emergency personnel. The telecommunicator must process calls from unknown and unseen individuals, usually calling under stressful conditions. He/she must be able to obtain complete, reliable information from the caller and prioritize requests for assistance. It is the dispatcher's responsibility to bring order to chaos.\n\nWhile some fire departments are large enough to utilize their own telecommunication dispatcher, most rural and small areas rely on a central dispatcher to provide handling of fire, rescue, and police services.\n\nFirefighters are trained to use [[Telecommunication|communications]] equipment to receive alarms, give and receive commands, request assistance, and report on conditions. Since firefighters from different agencies routinely provide mutual aid to each other, and routinely operate at incidents where other emergency services are present, it is essential to have structures in place to establish a unified chain of command, and share information between agencies. The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has established a National Incident Management System.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/NIMS_core.pdf]</ref> One component of this system is the [[Incident Command System]].\n\nAll [[radio communication]] in the United States is under authorization from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC); as such, fire departments that operate radio equipment must have radio licenses from the FCC.\n\n[[Ten codes]] were popular in the early days of radio equipment because of poor transmission and reception. Advances in modern radio technology have reduced the need for ten-codes and many departments have converted to simple English (clear text).\n\n===Ranks===\nMany firefighters are sworn members with command structures similar to the [[military]] and [[police]]. They do not have general [[Police|police powers]] (some firefighters in the [[United States]] have limited police powers, like [[fire police]] departments, while certain [[fire marshal]]s have full police powers, i.e. the ability to make warrantless arrests, and authority to carry a firearm on and off-duty), but have specific powers of enforcement and control in fire and emergency situations.\n\nThe basic unit of an American fire department is a \"company\", a group of firefighters who typically work on the same engine. A \"crew\" or \"platoon\" is a subdivision of a company who work on the same shift. Commonwealth fire services are more likely to be organized around a \"watch\", who work the same shift on multiple engines.<ref>[http://www.humbersidefire.gov.uk/careers/becoming-a-firefighter/shift-patterns Humberside Fire and Rescue Service: Shift patterns]</ref>\n\n====Australia====\nNew South Wales Rural Fire Service\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Additionally, in the volunteer fire departments, there is a difference between a rank and an official position. This is founded on the military traditions of the fire departments. Every firefighter can hold a high rank without having an official position. A firefighter can be promoted by years of service, training skills and qualifications. Official positions are partly elected or given by capabilities. These conditions allow that older ordinary firefighters have higher ranks than their leaders. But through this ranks are no authorities given ([[Brevet (military)|Brevet]]).\n\n;Professional Fire Fighters (Middle Technical Grades) of [[Rheinland-Pfalz]]\nCompleted vocational training in a technical occupation suitable for the fire service.

It is part of the Ministry of Interior's Department of Firefighters, Public Rescue and Public Protection. The CNVVF task is to provide safety for people, animals and property, and control the compliance of buildings and industries to fire safety rules. The Ministry of the Interior, through the CNVVF, adopts fire safety rules with ministerial decrees or other lower rank documents. The CNVVF also ensures public rescue in emergencies that involves the use of chemical weapons, bacteriological, radiological and materials.

In general, white helmets denote chief officers, while red helmets may denote company officers, but the specific meaning of a helmet's color or style varies from region to region and department to department. The rank of an officer in an American fire department is most commonly denoted by a number of [[speaking trumpet]]s, a reference to a [[megaphone]]-like device used in the early days of the fire service, although typically called \"[[bugle]]\" in today's parlance. Ranks proceed from one (lieutenant) to five (fire chief) bugles. Traditional ranks in American fire departments that exist but may not always be utilized in all cities or towns include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Firefighter'''\n::no bugles\n| '''Engineer/Technician/Sergeant'''\n::3 chevrons\n| '''Lieutenant'''\n::1 bugle\n|-\n| '''Captain'''\n::2 either traditionally side by side\n::or less usually crossed bugles\n| '''Battalion Chief/District Chief'''\n::2 either side by side\n::or more traditionally crossed bugles\n| '''Division Chief or Assistant /Deputy Asst.'''\n'''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::3 crossed bugles\n|-\n| '''Deputy Chief/Commissioner'''\n::4 crossed bugles\n| '''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::5 crossed bugles\n|\n|}\nIn many fire departments in the U.S., the captain is commonly the commander of a company and a lieutenant is the supervisor of the company's firefighters on shift. There is no state or federal rank structure for firefighters and each municipality or volunteer fire department creates and uses their own unique structure.\n\nStill, some other American fire departments such the FDNY use military rank insignia in addition or instead of the traditional bugles. Additionally, officers on [[Glossary of firefighting#T|truck companies]] have been known to use rank insignias shaped like axes for Lieutenants (1) and Captains (2).\n\n==Firefighter equipment==\n{{Main|Glossary of firefighting equipment}}\n<!-- Before you add anything else to this list, ask yourself \"Do many or most firefighters use this piece of equipment in a way that's notable, verifiable, and of interest to the general audience?\" If not, consider just adding it to the glossary of equipment article instead. -->\n<gallery>\nFile:TurkishFirefighterMOPP4.jpeg|Turkish firefighters in [[MOPP (protective gear)|MOPP]] 4 level protective gear during an exercise held at [[Incirlik Air Base]], [[Turkey]]\nFile:TFS fire equipment.jpg|[[Toronto Fire Services|Toronto firefighters]] prepare their equipment\nFile:03262012Demonstraciones_rescate_erum_fabian_acu\u00f1a137.JPG|A firefighter using a hydraulic cutter during a demonstration\nFile:Aa RN firefighter 01.jpg|[[Royal Navy|British naval men]] in firefighting gear on [[HMS Illustrious (R06)]], [[Liverpool]], 25 October 2009\n</gallery>\nA partial list of some equipment typically used by firefighters:\n* Hand tools, such as\n** Flat-head and pick-head [[axe]]\n** [[Pike pole]]\n** [[Halligan bar]]\n** [[Flashlight]]\n** [[Spanner wrench]]\n** Circular (\"K-12\"), Cutters Edge and chain saws\n** [[Hydraulic rescue tools]] such as spreaders, cutters, and rams\n* [[Personal protective equipment]] (\"PPE\") designed to withstand water and high temperatures, such as\n** [[Bunker gear]], including turnout jacket and pants\n** [[SCBA|Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)]]\n** Helmet, face mask and visor; climbing helmets\n** [[Safety boots]], gloves, and [[Nomex]] and Carbon flash hoods\n** [[PASS device|Personal alert safety system (PASS) device]]\n* Handheld radio, pager, or other communication devices\n* [[Thermal imaging camera (firefighting)|Thermal imaging camera]]\n* [[Gas detector]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of firefighting}}\n[[Image:Old firefighters.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of American firefighters in the 1770s]]\n[[File:Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm.jpg|thumb|Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Photograph taken by W.J. Carpenter in 1910.]]\n\nAlthough people have fought fires since there have been valuable things to burn, the first instance of organized professionals combating structural fires occurred in Ancient [[Egypt]]. Likewise, fire fighters of the [[Roman Republic]] existed solely as privately organized and funded groups that operated more similarly to a business than a public service; however, during the [[Principate]] period [[Augustus]] revolutionized firefighting by calling for the creation of a fire guard that was trained, paid, and equipped by the state- the first truly public and professional firefighting service. Known as the [[Vigiles]], they were organised into cohorts and also served as a night watch and city police force.\n\nThe earliest American fire departments were volunteers, including the volunteer fire company in [[New Amsterdam]], now known as [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Essentials of Firefighting</ref> Fire companies were composed of citizens who volunteered their time to help protect the community. As time progressed and new towns popped up throughout the region there was a sharp increase in the number of volunteer departments. The first career fire department was not established in the United States until 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio ([[Cincinnati Fire & EMS Department]]). Many large cities began establishing paid, full-time, staff in order to try facilitate greater fire-related call volume. St. Louis Fire Department followed Cincinnati four years later and became the second established career fire department in the country followed by other large cities like New York ([[FDNY]]). City fire departments draw their funding directly from city taxes and share the same budget as other public works like the police department and trash services. Aside from big city fire departments, many populated suburbs and towns have career fire departments. The primary difference between a municipality department and a City department is the funding. Municipal fire departments do not share their budget with any other service and are considered to be private entities within a jurisdiction. This means that they have their own taxes that feed into their budgeting needs. Another main difference is the structure of the department. City fire departments have the mayor at the top of the chain whereas municipal departments have elected board officials who help maintain and run the department along with the chief officer staff.\n\n==Fundraisers==\nFunds for fire-fighting equipment may be raised by the firefighters themselves, especially in the case of volunteer organizations. Events such as pancake breakfasts and chili feeds are common in the US. Social events are also used to raise money, including dances, community fairs and car washes.\n\n==Notable firefighters==\n{{Globalize|section|datej=December 2012|date=March 2020}}\n* [[James Braidwood (firefighter)]] (1800\u20131861), founder of the municipal fire brigade in Edinburgh, 1824\n* [[John Decker (fire chief)|John Decker]] (1823\u20131892), chief of the New York City department during the 1863 draft riots\n* [[Ra\u00fal G\u00e1ndara-Cartagena]] (1895\u20131989), first and kilongest-serving Puerto Rico commonwealth fire chief\n* [[James J.
