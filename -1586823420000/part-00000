On July 2, 2011, the Berry family was traveling home from a vacation in Colorado Springs. The parents, Joshua and Robin Berry were killed in a head-on collision while also leaving their two sons, Peter and Aaron, handicapped. Their daughter Willa suffered minor injuries. Watt met the children at a fundraiser and grew close to them. He played wheelchair basketball with them and mimed rolling a wheelchair after sacking a quarterback in a 2012 game. The mime was an agreed-upon signal between the Berry children and Watt as a post-sack celebration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1521740-why-jj-watt-should-be-your-favorite-nfl-player|title=Why J.J.

The episode was written by Lang Fisher and directed by [[Akiva Schaffer]]. It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 8, 2018. The episode features guest appearances from [[David Fumero]], [[Will Shortz]], and [[Allison Tolman]].  One of the most famous puzzle masters in Minnesota is Gavin Dahl and his previous puzzle master Emanuel Falaylae.  No other puzzle masters are here but the highest rank is the Puzza P.  \n\nThe show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the [[New York Police Department]] in [[Brooklyn]] and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. In the episode, Jake and Amy work on their last case before Amy becomes a Sergeant by working with Amy's favorite puzzle master, Vin Stermley. However, when Vin and Amy bond throughout the investigation, Jake grows jealous. Meanwhile, Holt and Gina meet the competition for Police Commissioner and are intimidated by a young woman in the running while Terry, Rosa, Hitchcock, and Scully debate over who should get the new Detective car.\n\nAccording to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by an estimated 1.74 million household viewers and gained a 0.8/3 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised Samberg's performance, character development and writing although the subplots received a mixed response.\n\n==Plot==\nAmy ([[Melissa Fumero]]) learns that she has passed her Sergeant's Exam and will be officially named in a week. Jake ([[Andy Samberg]]) decides to work with her on their last case before she is a sergeant and chooses an investigation of a series of arsons connected with Amy's love for crosswords.\n\nTo Amy's delight, Jake brings in the victim, Amy's favorite puzzle author, Melvin Stermley ([[David Fumero]]). To Jake\u2019s dismay, however, \u201cVin\u201d turns out to be hunky, personable, and the opposite of the nerd Jake envisioned. Vin and Amy begin bonding throughout the case, causing Jake to feel jealous. While pursuing a suspect due to Vin's hunch, Jake doesn't follow protocol and goes to another place for the next arson but finds that Vin's hunch was right, angering Amy. After Jake apologizes for his behavior, he solves the case by finding that it was Vin's obsessed neighbor who caused the fires (as part of an elaborate puzzle-marriage proposal).\n\nMeanwhile, Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]) and Gina ([[Chelsea Peretti]]) meet the competition for the Police Commissioner position. At the meeting, Holt is intimidated by Captain Olivia Crawford ([[Allison Tolman]]) who is in the running for the position. Holt solves the truce by proposing equal treatment for everyone running and both set aside their differences. Also, Terry ([[Terry Crews]]), Rosa ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]), Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]), and Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) debate over who should get the new Detective car. Rosa decides to give it to Terry, who is willing to help his colleagues whenever in need.\n\n==Reception==\n===Viewers===\nIn its original American broadcast, \"The Puzzle Master\" was seen by an estimated 1.74 million household viewers and gained a 0.8/3 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-april-8-2018/|title=\u2018America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos\u2019 rerun adjusts up: Sunday final ratings|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=January 7, 2019}}</ref> This was slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.78 million viewers with a 0.8/3 in the 18-49 demographics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-april-1-2018/|title=\u2018Bob\u2019s Burgers\u2019 and \u2018Dateline\u2019 adjust up: Sunday final ratings|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=April 3, 2018|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> This means that 0.8 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it.
