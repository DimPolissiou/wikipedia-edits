WP:MOS-ZH--> was a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|kingdom]] within the [[Han Empire]] of China, located in present-day [[Hunan]] and some surrounding areas. The kingdom was founded when [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] granted the territory to [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], one of his main followers, around the same time as the establishment of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. Wu Rui and his descendants held the kingdom for five generations until Wu Zhu died without an heir in 157 BC. In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, a [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in the [[collapse of Qin]]. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebel. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the Han leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] Hegemon-King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). Han would eventually won [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|its conflict]] with Chu and emerge as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] established by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority.

The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties.

Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the vassal kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly responsible for the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0'')&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was only in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}} The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') were similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9'') who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king for the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the high status of the court clerk was similar to that of the [[Warring States]] rather than the Han central government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced.

WP:MOS-ZH--> was a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|kingdom]] within the [[Han Empire]] of China, located in present-day [[Hunan]] and some surrounding areas. The kingdom was founded when [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] granted the territory to [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], one of his main followers, around the same time as the establishment of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. Wu Rui and his descendants held the kingdom for five generations until Wu Zhu died without an heir in 157 BC. In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, a [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in the [[collapse of Qin]]. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebel. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the Han leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] Hegemon-King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). Han would eventually won [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|its conflict]] with Chu and emerge as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] established by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority. Changsha, located on the empire's southern fringe, was among the weakest among the kingdoms; however, it was the only one to survive beyond 190s BC.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} In {{nowrap|195 BC,}} [[Ying Bu]], King of [[Huainan]] and son-in-law of Wu Rui, rebelled against the Han and was defeated.

Hui reigned for seven years, and was succeeded by his son Wu You {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u53f3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Y\u00f2u''), whose name is also recorded as Wu Ruo {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u82e5}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ru\u00f2'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=107}} At the time, the Han dynasty was under [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] and [[Empress L\u00fc]], who favored lenient laws and political views of the [[Huang\u2013Lao]] school of philosophy. Changsha was able to develop under relative peace.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=31}} In {{nowrap|183 BC,}} however, Empress L\u00fc banned the export of [[iron ware]] to Nanyue, which angered Zhao Tuo, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of Nanyue and then twice invaded Changsha, occupying a few [[county (China)|counties]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=136}} Later, during Empress L\u00fc's reign, the imperial court decided to launch a military campaign against Nanyue.

The campaign was eventually cancelled with the death of Empress L\u00fc.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}} In {{nowrap|178 BC,}} the kingdom passed to Wu You's son Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u8457}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Zh\u00f9''), for whom the names Wu Chai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u5dee}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u0101i'') and Wu Chan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u7522}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u01cen'') are alternatively used in some records.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=113}} Wu Zhu reigned for twenty-one years, dying in {{nowrap|157 BC}} without male issue.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nAfter the extinction of this house, [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u767c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa F\u0101'') in {{nowrap|155 BC.}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} Fa's mother, Tang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}, ''T\u00e1ng''), was a servant of the Emperor's concubine Cheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7a0b}}}}, ''Ch\u00e9ng'') and had given birth to Fa after the intoxicated emperor had mistaken her for his favorite concubine. Consequently, Fa had the lowest status among the Emperor's 14 sons and was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] in Changsha, far away from the capital [[Chang'an]] and the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=35\u201336}} Changsha Kingdom was held by the Liu family until early the 1st century AD, when the Han dynasty was interrupted by usurper [[Wang Mang]]. Along with other kings of the Liu family in the empire, Liu Shun {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u821c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa Sh\u00f9n''), the last King of Changsha, was demoted first to the rank of duke and then to a commoner.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}} After the restoration of Han dynasty, the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu Emperor]], himself a descendant of Liu Fa, gave Changsha to Liu Shun's son Liu Xing {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u8208}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'') in {{nowrap|AD 26.}} In 33 the Emperor rescinded the decision and demoted Xing to the rank of a marquis, citing the distance of kinship between Xing and himself.

The official ''[[Book of Han]]'' reports Changsha's border \u201creaching the north bank of [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] and stretching to [[Jiuyi Mountains]]\u201d, although it is unlikely that Changsha actually reached so far. Similarly, it reports that, when Emperor Gaozu created the Kingdom of Changsha, he granted Wu Rui authority over the five [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commanderies]] of Changsha, Yuzhang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}}},}} ''Y\u00f9zh\u0101ng''), Xiang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c61}}}}, ''Xi\u00e0ng''), Guilin {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u6797}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecl\u00edn'') and Nanhai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5357\u6d77}}}},}} ''N\u00e1nh\u01cei''). However, Yuzhang Commandery had already been conferred to Ying Bu, the King of Huainan, while Xiang, Guilin, and Nanhai Commanderies were all held by Zhao Tuo, the effectively independent King of Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=42}} This state of the Changsha\u2013Nanyue border was confirmed in a [[Early Chinese cartography|map]] unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] tombs.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}} On the other hand, other preserved and unearthed texts have shown that there were two other commanderies actually controlled by the Changsha Kingdom: Wuling {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6b66\u9675}}}},}} ''W\u01d4l\u00edng'') and Guiyang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u967d}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecy\u00e1ng''). The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties. Changsha's southern frontier with Nanyue was approximately the modern southern border of Hunan.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}}\n\nWhen Emperor Jing granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa, the kingdom's territory was reduced to Changsha Commandery alone. Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the vassal kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly responsible for the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0'')&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was only in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}} The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') were similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9'') who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king for the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the high status of the court clerk was similar to that of the [[Warring States]] rather than the Han central government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced. In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} the kingdom only administered thirteen counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}}\n\nIn regions inhabited by the Baiyue, larger but less populated [[circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] were used in place of counties. Two circuits{{mdash}}He ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9f55}}}}, ''H\u00e9'') and Ling ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6ce0}}}}, ''L\u00edng''){{mdash}}are noted on the map unearthed at Mawangdui. Counties were each headed by a [[county magistrate|magistrate]] and were subdivided into [[township (China)|townships]] and villages ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u91cc}}}}, ''l\u01d0'') in the same manner as in centrally administered territories of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=151}}\n\nThe reestablishment of the Changsha Kingdom under Liu Fa coincided with the abortive [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent drastic measures to limit the autonomy of kingdoms by Emperor Jing. In {{nowrap|145 BC,}} the vassal kingdoms were stripped of the right to appoint officials with salaries higher than [[Government of the Han dynasty#Salaries|400 ''dan'']], which covered everyone from ministers in the royal court to county magistrates.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Furthermore, changes were made to the government hierarchy of kingdoms. A number of offices were abolished, including the royal secretary, minister of justice {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5ef7\u5c09}}}},}} ''t\u00edngw\u00e8i''), minister of the royal clan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b97\u6b63}}}},}} ''z\u014dngzh\u00e8ng''), steward {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c11\u5e9c}}}},}} ''sh\u01ceof\u01d4''), and court scholar {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u535a\u58eb}}}},}} ''b\u00f3sh\u00ec'').{{sfn|He|2013|p=253}} Of particular importance was the abolition of the steward, as this move deprived the kings of their fiscal control over the fief.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Many remaining offices were demoted in rank, and lesser officials were reduced in number.{{sfn|He|2013|p=253}} The titles of the chancellor and tutor were shortened to simply ''xi\u00e0ng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8}}}}) and ''f\u00f9'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5085}}}}) to distinguish them from their imperial equivalents.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=106}} Later, in {{nowrap|8 BC,}} the court clerk was abolished and the chancellor took over his duties.

{"title_page": "Nilgiri Ghat Roads", "text_new": "Many '''[[Ghat Roads]]''' can be found in the [[Nilgiris District]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Southern India]]. Nearly all of the district is located in the [[Nilgiri Hills]], part of the [[Western Ghats]] mountains. This area borders the states of [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. The hills consequently can be reached by road from three states. Most of these Ghat Roads go through heavily forested mountains and contain a number of sharp hair-pin bends.\n\n== Route Descriptions ==\nThere are five main Ghat Roads leading into the Nilgiris:<ref name=\"sdfjklqace\">{{cite web | url= http://www.investingintamilnadu.com/tamilnadu/doc/policy/Highways_and_Minor_Ports.pdf | title= Details of Government Roads in Tamil Nadu | author= Investingintamilnadu, Tamil Nadu Industrial Guidance & Export Promotion Bureau, Industries Department (Government of Tamil Nadu)  | accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Kotagiri Ghat (State Highway 15) ===\nRoute: [[Erode]]-[[Gobichettipalayam]]-[[Sathyamangalam]]-[[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]]-[[Aravenu]]-[[Kotagiri]]-[[Ooty]]\n\nThe Kotagiri Ghat is the oldest known route into the Nilgiris. It approximately follows the route taken by [[John Sullivan (British governor)|John Sullivan]] on his discovery trips in 1819. The distance between Mettupalayam and Kotagiri on this road is 33&nbsp;km and it has only 4 hair pin bends. This road is part of [[State Highway 15 (Tamil Nadu)|State Highway 15]]. It is slightly less travelled as it is a slightly longer route from Mettupalayam to Ooty than the route via [[Coonoor]], though as of 2012 the road condition is superior to the Coonoor Ghat road. It is also statistically less vulnerable to landslips. It is possible to divert from this route to Coonoor. There is a link from Aravenu to [[Bandishola]].\n\nTravellers reach [[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]] from [[Coimbatore]] and from [[Chennai]] via [[Erode]] and [[Gobichettipalayam]].\n\n=== Coonoor Ghat (National Highway 67) ===\nRoute: [[Coimbatore]]-[[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]]-Kallar-[[Burliar]]-Coonoor-[[Ooty]]-[[Pykara]]\n\nThis is also known as the '''Kallar Ghat''', as it follows the valley of the Kallar and Coonoor rivers. It is by far the most traveled of all the Ghat Roads as it is the main access from the home state of Tamil Nadu. It has 14 numbered Hairpin bends and was recently (c.2003) taken over to be owned and maintained by the [[National Highways Authority of India]] and is now part of '''[[National Highway 181 (India)|National Highway 181]]'''. Previously a toll had to be paid for vehicles entering [[The Nilgiris District|the Nilgiris district]] at the village of Burliar, which also provides a rest stop on the route.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe road was shut in 2010 due to [[landslides]] caused by heavy rains in the region.<ref name=\"trafficresume\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/article80877.ece|title=Traffic resumes on Mettupalayam-Coonoor Road|date=2010-01-15|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=Coimbatore}}</ref> Subsequently, the [[National Highways Authority of India]] had the road re-laid which got eroded, again due to rains.<ref name=\"gapinghole\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/chennai/28250762_1_nhai-repair-culverts|title=Rs 6 crore down the drain, Ooty highways is a gaping hole now|last=Thiagarajan|first=Shantha |date=2010-10-20|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=Chennai}}</ref> In 2012, the [[Highways of Tamil Nadu|Highways Department]] decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the NHAI, under Section 133 of Criminal Penal Code, dealing with acts endangering human life, due to non maintenance of the road.<ref name=\"criminalnhai\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article3249391.ece|title=Criminal proceedings likely against NHAI|last=D.|first=Radhakrishnan|date=2012-03-27|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=31 March 2012|location=Udhagamandalam}}</ref>\n\n=== Gudalur Ghat   (National Highway 212 and 67) ===\nRoute: [[Gundlupet]]-[[Bandipur]]-[[Mudumalai National Park|Mudumalai]]-[[Gudalur (Nilgiris district)|Gudalur]]-Ooty\n\nThis is also simply known as the Mysore Ghat or Mysore Road. It is the main access route from Karnataka and Kerala. Travellers from Karnataka reach Gundlupet via the [[Mysore]]-Gundlupet National Highway 212 and travellers from Kerala reach Gudalur via the continuation of National Highway 212 from [[Kozhikode]]-[[Sultan Bathery]].\n\nOne traveller commented about this route: '''\"The road from Mysore is arguably the most scenic with a long stretch that runs through the Mudumalai National Park, and if travelling in the early morning or late evening, you will definitely spot wildlife feeding along the road, even the odd carnivore. There are majestic stands of Eucalyptus amidst well tended tea estates as you near Gudalur, and then you drive past the [[Pykara|Pykara Dam]] and [[Pykara|Pykara falls]]\"'''.\n\nAs with the Coonoor Ghat, from 2003-2006 this route was in a terrible state of repair. This route towards Gudalur from Ooty is the continuation of the same \"National Highway\" NH67 which makes up the Coonoor Ghat. National Highway 67 terminates in Gudulur where it joins National Highway 212 towards Gundlupet.\n\n=== Sigur Ghat (State Highway 67) ===\nRoute: [[Mudumalai National Park|Mudumalai]]-Kalhatti-Ooty\n\nThis is also known as Kalhatti Ghat (or simply 'Steep Ghat'). There is a short-cut branch off the Gudalur ghat at Theppakadu in Mudumalai. This route saves approx. 30&nbsp;km on the standard Gudalur route, though it is by far the steeper route and is generally limited to short wheel-base vehicles. It has 36 hairpin bends and is closed overnight.\n\n=== Manjur Ghat ===\nRoute: [[Karamadai]](Coimbatore)-Athikadavu-Mulli-Geddai-Manjoor-Kundha Dam-Yedakadu-Mount Lawrence ([[Avalanji Road]])-Emerald Cross Road-Muthurai Palada-Fern Hill-[[Ooty]]\n\nThis is a smaller ghat for local Coimbatore city traffic towards Ooty, and is used as a backup road on the rare occasions that both the Coonoor Ghat and the Kotagiri Ghat are closed. The road is narrow with 48 hairpin bends below Manjoor. At Geddai, near the bottom of the ghat at {{convert|1885|ft|m}}  there are two hydroelectric power stations [http://www.nilgiris.com/manjurdam.htm]. From Manjoor, at the top of the ghat, the distance is equidistant to either Ooty or Coonoor via other district roads. ODR.<ref>http://theindia.info/Blog/Ooty-by-Manjoor-Most-Beautiful-Road-to-Ooty-from-Coimbatore/ Ooty by Manjoor</ref>\n\n== Conditions ==\nUntil recently, all access roads to the Nilgiri hills were toll roads in order to facilitate the high maintenance costs. Roads are now in much better condition that a few years ago. However, it is not uncommon for a route to be closed for several days or even weeks due to [[Landslide|landslip]]s. If so traffic is usually diverted onto one of the other ghats. The Nilgiris have been totally cut off on all routes on rare occasions. As the supply infrastructure depends on these routes, any road activity (such as a closure) is reflected in the prices. During the main tourist season, a one-way system is implemented between the first two ghat roads mentioned.  Uphill traffic goes from Coimbatore to Ooty via Coonoor, whereas downhill traffic goes from Ooty to Coimbatore via Kotagiri.\n\n== References ==\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY9WalzFldU Kalhatti Ghat, Ooty-Mudumalai-Mysore Road]\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Indian Highways Network}}\n\n[[Category:State highways in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:Scenic roads in India]]\n[[Category:Transport in Ooty]]\n", "text_old": "Many '''[[Ghat Roads]]''' can be found in the [[Nilgiris District]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Southern India]].

The weekend saw a massive crash for [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] driver [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] in the third free practice session, after he lost control of his car at turn 13, hit a wall, and went into the Tecpro barriers. He was declared fit to start the race. [[Nico Rosberg]] took pole position but he was forced to retire in the early stages due to a faulty throttle. His teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] took the win, ahead of [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]'s [[Sebastian Vettel]], and [[Force India]]'s [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]], who had initially lost third place on the final lap, but retook it after [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Valtteri Bottas]] both collided while battling each other for third, with Bottas retiring on the spot and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen receiving a 30-second post race penalty for the collision. [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] also secured their second consecutive constructor's championship, having done so at the previous year's event.\n\nThe [[2016 Russian Grand Prix|2016 event]] was held on 1 May 2016, moved forward to the fourth round of the calendar, unlike the previous two events. The race saw a big crash at the start at turn 2 that saw [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]], [[Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez]], and [[Rio Haryanto]] all eliminated, while [[Sebastian Vettel]] was hit in the back by [[Daniil Kvyat]] going into turn 2, then he was hit again at turn 3, causing him to spin out and crash out of the race. On the Thursday after the event, [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] announced that they demoted Kvyat back to [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] for the rest of the season, switching places with 18-year-old Dutchman [[Max Verstappen]]. [[Nico Rosberg]] was the winner with [[Lewis Hamilton]] making it a one-two finish for Mercedes.\n\nThe [[2017 Russian Grand Prix|2017 event]] was held on 30 April 2017, and saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] secure his first career win in Formula One, ahead of the Ferrari pair of [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikkonen]]. Vettel and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen locked out the front row but both were passed by Bottas on the run to turn 2. The race saw [[Fernando Alonso]] unable to start due to a problem with his power unit and [[Romain Grosjean]] and [[Jolyon Palmer]] eliminated in a crash that saw the [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] driver launch the [[Haas F1 Team|Haas]] driver into the air and into the barrier. Both drivers escaped unhurt. Bottas took the win by just 0.7 seconds from Vettel in the end, with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen setting the fastest lap.\n\nThe [[2018 Russian Grand Prix|2018 race]] was held on 30 September 2018, moved back from its April slot to fill a vacancy left by the [[Malaysian Grand Prix]], which was discontinued at the end of 2017. The event saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] take pole position one year after securing his first ever victory at the circuit.\nThe race was notable for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] ordering Bottas to let teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] to overtake for second place at turn 13 on lap 26.

A lap later, [[George Russell (racing driver)|George Russell]] crashed into the barriers at Turn 9, which was an apparent wheel nut failure, as stated by the Williams team,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wheel-nut-retainer-caused-russell-retirement-in-sochi-say-williams.3IB9jqVwUl4Ek8aJUqOW8X.html|title=Russian Grand Prix 2019: Wheel nut retainer caused Russell retirement in Sochi, say Williams &#124; Formula 1\u00ae|website=www.formula1.com}}</ref> which prompted [[Robert Kubica]] to retire in order for the team to conserve parts.

The weekend saw a massive crash for [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] driver [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] in the third free practice session, after he lost control of his car at turn 13, hit a wall, and went into the Tecpro barriers. He was declared fit to start the race. [[Nico Rosberg]] took pole position but he was forced to retire in the early stages due to a faulty throttle. His teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] took the win, ahead of [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]'s [[Sebastian Vettel]], and [[Force India]]'s [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]], who had initially lost third place on the final lap, but retook it after [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Valtteri Bottas]] both collided while battling each other for third, with Bottas retiring on the spot and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen receiving a 30-second post race penalty for the collision. [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] also secured their second consecutive constructor's championship, having done so at the previous year's event.\n\nThe [[2016 Russian Grand Prix|2016 event]] was held on 1 May 2016, moved forward to the fourth round of the calendar, unlike the previous two events. The race saw a big crash at the start at turn 2 that saw [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]], [[Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez]], and [[Rio Haryanto]] all eliminated, while [[Sebastian Vettel]] was hit in the back by [[Daniil Kvyat]] going into turn 2, then he was hit again at turn 3, causing him to spin out and crash out of the race. On the Thursday after the event, [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] announced that they demoted Kvyat back to [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]] for the rest of the season, switching places with 18-year-old Dutchman [[Max Verstappen]]. [[Nico Rosberg]] was the winner with [[Lewis Hamilton]] making it a one-two finish for Mercedes.\n\nThe [[2017 Russian Grand Prix|2017 event]] was held on 30 April 2017, and saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] secure his first career win in Formula One, ahead of the Ferrari pair of [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikkonen]]. Vettel and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen locked out the front row but both were passed by Bottas on the run to turn 2. The race saw [[Fernando Alonso]] unable to start due to a problem with his power unit and [[Romain Grosjean]] and [[Jolyon Palmer]] eliminated in a crash that saw the [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] driver launch the [[Haas F1 Team|Haas]] driver into the air and into the barrier. Both drivers escaped unhurt. Bottas took the win by just 0.7 seconds from Vettel in the end, with R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen setting the fastest lap.\n\nThe [[2018 Russian Grand Prix|2018 race]] was held on 30 September 2018, moved back from its April slot to fill a vacancy left by the [[Malaysian Grand Prix]], which was discontinued at the end of 2017. The event saw [[Valtteri Bottas]] take pole position one year after securing his first ever victory at the circuit.\nThe race was notable for [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] ordering Bottas to let teammate [[Lewis Hamilton]] to overtake for second place at turn 13 on lap 26. Hamilton himself took his third win at the circuit, with Bottas second ahead of [[Sebastian Vettel]]. The result sparked discussions about the future of team orders in the sport, with some{{Who|date=December 2019}} even calling for an outright ban on the practice.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn the [[2019 Russian Grand Prix]], [[Charles Leclerc]] was on pole ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, but Vettel jumped the both of them going into Turn 2, and led the race until lap 26, when he suffered a MGU-K failure. A lap later, [[George Russell]] crashed into the barriers at Turn 9, which was an apparent wheel nut failure, as stated by the Williams team,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wheel-nut-retainer-caused-russell-retirement-in-sochi-say-williams.3IB9jqVwUl4Ek8aJUqOW8X.html|title=Russian Grand Prix 2019: Wheel nut retainer caused Russell retirement in Sochi, say Williams &#124; Formula 1\u00ae|website=www.formula1.com}}</ref> which prompted [[Robert Kubica]] to retire in order for the team to conserve parts.

The situation came to a head when Michigan petitioned for [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1835 and sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries. Both sides passed legislation attempting to force the other side's capitulation, while Ohio's [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor]] [[Robert Lucas (governor)|Robert Lucas]] and Michigan's 24-year-old \"Boy [[Governors of Michigan Territory|Governor]]\" [[Stevens T. Mason]] helped institute criminal penalties for citizens submitting to the other's authority. Both states deployed militias on opposite sides of the [[Maumee River]] near [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], but besides mutual taunting, there was little interaction between the two forces. The single military confrontation of the \"war\" ended with a report of shots being fired into the air, incurring no casualties.\n\nDuring the summer of 1836, Congress proposed a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and about three-quarters of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Although the northern region's mineral wealth would later become an economic asset to Michigan, at the time the compromise was considered a poor outcome for the new state, and voters in a statehood convention in September soundly rejected the proposal. But in December, the Michigan government, facing a dire financial crisis and pressure from Congress and President [[Andrew Jackson]], called another convention (called the \"Frostbitten Convention\") which accepted the compromise that resolved the Toledo War.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Northwest territory.png|thumb|right|Map of the [[Northwest Territory]] as established by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in the [[Northwest Ordinance]], shown with present-day state borders, and correct spatial relationship between Lakes Michigan and Erie]]\n\nIn 1787, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] enacted the [[Northwest Ordinance]], which created the [[Northwest Territory]] in what is now the upper [[Midwestern United States]].

This provision would guarantee that most of the [[Maumee River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]] and all of the southern shore of Lake Erie west of Pennsylvania would fall in Ohio.<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\"/> The draft constitution with this proviso was accepted by the United States Congress, but before Ohio's admission to the Union in February 1803, the proposed constitution was referred to a [[United States Congressional committee|Congressional committee]].

The canal finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into [[boomtown]]s.<ref name=\"Meinig1\">{{harvp|Meinig|1993|pp=357, 363, 436, and 440}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Erie Canal inspired many other canal projects. Because the western end of Lake Erie offered the shortest overland route to the frontiers of Indiana and [[Illinois]], Maumee Harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value. Detroit was {{convert|20|mi|km}} up the Detroit River from Lake Erie, and faced the difficult barrier of the Great Black Swamp to the south. Because of this, Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals, and later railroads, than was Toledo.

The situation came to a head when Michigan petitioned for [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1835 and sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries. Both sides passed legislation attempting to force the other side's capitulation, while Ohio's [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor]] [[Robert Lucas (governor)|Robert Lucas]] and Michigan's 24-year-old \"Boy [[Governors of Michigan Territory|Governor]]\" [[Stevens T. Mason]] helped institute criminal penalties for citizens submitting to the other's authority. Both states deployed militias on opposite sides of the [[Maumee River]] near [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], but besides mutual taunting, there was little interaction between the two forces. The single military confrontation of the \"war\" ended with a report of shots being fired into the air, incurring no casualties.\n\nDuring the summer of 1836, Congress proposed a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and about three-quarters of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Although the northern region's mineral wealth would later become an economic asset to Michigan, at the time the compromise was considered a poor outcome for the new state, and voters in a statehood convention in September soundly rejected the proposal. But in December, the Michigan government, facing a dire financial crisis and pressure from Congress and President [[Andrew Jackson]], called another convention (called the \"Frostbitten Convention\") which accepted the compromise that resolved the Toledo War.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Northwest territory.png|thumb|right|Map of the [[Northwest Territory]] as established by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in the [[Northwest Ordinance]], shown with present-day state borders, and correct spatial relationship between Lakes Michigan and Erie]]\n\nIn 1787, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] enacted the [[Northwest Ordinance]], which created the [[Northwest Territory]] in what is now the upper [[Midwestern United States]].

Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes only via Lakes Michigan, [[Lake Huron|Huron]], and [[Lake Superior|Superior]].<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\">{{harvp|Mendenhall|Graham|1895|pp=127, 154}}</ref>\n\n{{wikisource2| The Northwest Ordinance}}{{wikisource2| Enabling act for Ohio 1802}}During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, the delegates allegedly received reports from a [[fur trapping|fur trapper]] that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than had previously been believed (or mapped). Thus, it was possible that an east-west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of [[Maumee Bay]], or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\" />\n{{wikisource2|Ohio Constitution of 1802}}\n\nAddressing this contingency, the Ohio delegates included a provision in the draft Ohio constitution that if the trapper's report about Lake Michigan's position was correct, the state boundary line would be angled slightly northeast so as to intersect Lake Erie at the \"most northerly cape of the Miami [Maumee] Bay\". This provision would guarantee that most of the [[Maumee River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]] and all of the southern shore of Lake Erie west of Pennsylvania would fall in Ohio.<ref name=\"publications.ohiohistory.org\"/> The draft constitution with this proviso was accepted by the United States Congress, but before Ohio's admission to the Union in February 1803, the proposed constitution was referred to a [[United States Congressional committee|Congressional committee]].

One such canal system approved by the Ohio legislature in 1825 was the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] that included a connection to the Ohio River and an outflow into Lake Erie via the Maumee River.<ref name=\"MSU\"/>\n\nDuring the conflict over the Toledo Strip, the [[Erie Canal]] was built, linking [[New York City]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] to the Great Lakes at [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. The canal finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into [[boomtown]]s.<ref name=\"Meinig1\">{{harvp|Meinig|1993|pp=357, 363, 436, and 440}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Erie Canal inspired many other canal projects. Because the western end of Lake Erie offered the shortest overland route to the frontiers of Indiana and [[Illinois]], Maumee Harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value. Detroit was {{convert|20|mi|km}} up the Detroit River from Lake Erie, and faced the difficult barrier of the Great Black Swamp to the south. Because of this, Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals, and later railroads, than was Toledo. From this perspective on the rapidly developing Midwest of the 1820s and 1830s, both states had much to gain by controlling the land in the Toledo Strip.<ref name=\"Meinig1\"/>\n\nIn addition, the Strip west of the Toledo area is a prime location for [[agriculture]], because of its well-drained, fertile [[loam]] soil.

Congress offered the region in red to the state of [[Michigan]] in exchange for the Toledo Strip, as a compromise.]]The \"war\" unofficially ended on December 14, 1836, at a second convention in Ann Arbor. Delegates passed a resolution to accept the terms set forth by the Congress. The calling of the convention was itself controversial. It had only come about because of an upswelling of private summonses, petitions, and public meetings. Since the legislature did not approve a call to convention, some said the convention was illegal. [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] boycotted the convention. As a consequence, the resolution was rejected and ridiculed by many Michigan residents.<ref name=\"Wittkeopcit\" /> Congress questioned the legality of the convention, but accepted the results of the convention regardless of its concerns.

Re-survey protocol would ordinarily require the surveyors to follow the Harris line exactly, but in this case, the surveyors deviated from the line in places. This prevented the situation of certain residents near the border being subject to changes in state residence, or land owners having parcels on both sides of the border. The 1915 survey was delineated by 71 [[granite]] markers, {{convert|12|in|cm}} wide by {{convert|18|in|cm}} high. Upon completion, the two states' governors, [[Woodbridge N.

He made his first appearance on 14 December 2006.\n\nJay's storylines include being part of a gang, coping with the death of his father [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]), being orphaned by age 14 which results in his going into [[foster care]] and then being taken care of by the [[Mitchell family]], as well as maturing from a wayward teen, becoming a surrogate brother to [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden), helping Ben cover up the murder of [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), being arrested for having indecent images of a child on his mobile phone after discovering his girlfriend [[Linzi Bragg]] ([[Amy-Leigh Hickman]]) is below the [[age of consent]], drug dealing and developing a drug habit by taking cocaine. In August 2017, in a [[List of EastEnders two-hander episodes#Phil and Jay (21 August 2017)|two-hander episode between Phil and Jay]], Jay finds out that Phil accidentally killed his biological father, a homeless boy who was at the car lot the night that Phil set it alight, however, this is later revealed to be a lie. When [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) returns in 2018, they embark on a fling which later returns into a relationship. However, [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]) returns in 2019 causing chaos. Lola tells Jay that she is engaged and Jay and Ruby make their relationship official.\n\n==Storylines==\nJay is mentioned in 2006 when his dying grandmother [[Evie Brown]] ([[Marji Campi]]) tells his grandfather [[Bert Atkinson]] ([[Dave Hill (actor)|Dave Hill]]) that he has a grandson. Their daughter, Karen, is Jay's mother who died from [[breast cancer]]. Jay appears after Evie's funeral, when he is taken to live with Bert in [[Walford]], per Evie's wishes. Jay is a troublesome youth: he steals, breaks into [[Pauline Fowler]]'s ([[Wendy Richard]]) house, and offends [[Yolande Trueman]] ([[Angela Wynter]]) with a racist slur to impress his peers. When Jay's father [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]) arrives, Bert leaves to allow Jay and Jase to bond. Jay continues getting into trouble, becoming involved with a gang of older boys, known as the E20 crew, led by [[Tegs Teague]] ([[Ben Smith (actor)|Ben Smith]]). Jay helps them shoplift, and they give him a knife. The gang terrorises [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) and Jay steals her keys so they can break into her house. The gang orders Jay to throw a brick through Dot's window, but realising it is wrong, Jay refuses and is rejected from the gang. Tegs later confronts Jay and a fight ensues, with Jay being stabbed in the leg. Tegs is arrested and his mother [[Tina Teague]] (Kerry Ann White) tries to threaten Jay from testifying against her son at his trial. However, she is scared off by Jase's girlfriend [[Dawn Swann]] ([[Kara Tointon]]). Jay gives evidence at the trial and Tegs is sentenced to two years in a Young Offenders Institute.\n\nJay and Jase try to flee Walford when Jase double-crosses a [[football firm]] but Dawn stops their departure by setting a date for her and Jase's wedding. The firm, led by [[Terry Bates (EastEnders)|Terry Bates]] ([[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]]), holds Jay hostage to get revenge on Jase. Jase is able to save Jay with [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) help but is beaten to death by Terry's men, and Billy, too frightened to intervene, leaves Jase to die. Jay accuses Dawn of causing his father's death and goes into care to get away from her. Jay is later fostered by Billy, who is wracked with guilt for not saving Jase from the gang. Jay's behaviour worsens when he plans an arson attack on Dawn, but Billy is able to stop him and Jay eventually makes amends with Dawn. Jay and Billy move into a flat with [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), who tries to get rid of Jay by stealing and blaming it on him. Feeling unwanted, Jay befriends [[Marissa Moore]] ([[Finn Atkins]]), who works at a [[brothel]], and they plan to run away together. When Marissa backs out, Jay runs away alone and sleeps rough, until Billy convinces him to move back in. Terry's trial for Jase's murder approaches and Jay is furious to learn that, rather than attempting to help Jase, Billy hid to save himself. Terry's wife, [[Viv Bates]] ([[Dido Miles]]), threatens to hurt Jay if Billy testifies. Jay is taken hostage by Terry's firm as a security measure, and Billy risks his own life to save him. Billy and Jay are both rescued by the police and Billy testifies, which results in Terry receiving life imprisonment for murder, partially redeeming himself in the eyes of Jay.\n\nBilly and Jay move in with Billy's relative [[Phil Mitchell]]'s ([[Steve McFadden]]). Phil gives Jay a job as a mechanic and they bond. Phil is proud of Jay when he overpowers [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]), a man who sells stolen goods for Phil. In doing so, Jay stops Connor stealing Phil's profits. Impressed with Jay's courage, Phil is pleased when Jay decides to change his surname to Mitchell, though it upsets Phil's son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe). Despite initial animosity between Ben and Jay, they grow fond of each other, referring to themselves as \"brothers\". Jay starts dating [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) despite objections from her father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]), who thinks Jay is only interested in sex. Jay and Abi do plan to have sex several times, but on each occasion, they are unable to go through with it. Despite Abi's insecurities over Jay's friendship with [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), she and Jay remain together, and eventually Max comes to accept them as a couple.\n\nIn 2012, Phil is imprisoned for the murder of his ex-partner [[Stella Crawford]] ([[Sophie Thompson]]), who abused Ben then jumped from a building in 2007 after Phil confronted her. It transpires that Ben is behind Phil's arrest, having given a false testimony to the police to punish his father for rejecting him for being gay. Ben admits giving false testimony to his half-brother, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), but [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Ferguson]]) overhears. Although it is Ian who tells the police about Ben's lie, Ben assumes it is Heather; he confronts her and in a rage, strikes her over the head with a picture frame, killing her. Jay witnesses the murder and is persuaded by Phil, who has just been released from prison, to cover-up Ben's involvement. Jay is traumatised by the murder and incensed to discover Ben has kept evidence to frame him for Heather's murder, should he need to. When Heather's finac\u00e9 [[Andrew Cotton]] ([[Ricky Grover]]) is falsely charged with Heather's murder, Jay is unable to see him sent to prison and tells the police Andrew is innocent, saying he saw him elsewhere at the time of Heather's murder; Andrew is released without charge. With Phil and Ben frequently fighting in the wake of the cover-up, Jay decides he cannot remain living with them and moves in with Abi's family. However, after a long discussion with Max, Jay returns home to live with Phil and his partner [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who is unaware of Jay's involvement in Heather's death as she was Heather's best friend. Jay is upset when he discovers Abi is planning to go to [[Costa Rica]] and proposes to her. She tells him she does not want to be a young bride and leaves for Costa Rica, leaving him heartbroken. Jay seeks comfort in Lola, and after breaking into [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, Lola kisses a stunned Jay. While cleaning under Ben's bed, Jay finds the photo frame that Ben used to murder Heather. Horrified, Jay wants to report Ben to the police, but Ben hides the frame in a bin bag. They both agree to dispose of the frame but later find it is missing, as it has been handed in to the local charity shop.\n\nJay supports Lola through her labour and bonds with the baby, [[Lexi Pearce|Lexi]], in the absence of the biological father. Shirley eventually uncovers the truth about Heather's murder and is horrified that Phil and Jay knew. Ben confesses to the police and they find the photo frame. Jay then backs up Ben's story, is charged with [[perverting the course of justice]] and released on bail to live with Billy (unable to return to Phil's as he is a witness). Jay visits Phil, who orders him to change his statement so Ben will not go to prison. However, Jay refuses and Phil disowns him. Jay is comforted by [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]). Billy then tells Jay he cannot stay with him; Jay brands him a coward, and breaks down as he misses his father. He is forced to sleep rough and [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) lets him in for food and drink until her husband [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) turns him away. Jay then secretly sees Lola but she is scared of him and tells him not to go near Lexi. Rejected by the rest of the community, Jay then stays with Patrick, who has offered him a place to stay. Abi returns from her trip and learns from her parents about Jay's involvement in Heather's murder, and she rejects him. The next day she tells him he should have done more to stop Ben. He resumes his friendship with Lola and helps her steal cleaning supplies to make money, and they end up sharing a kiss in front of Abi. Abi insists she is happy for them both, however, Lola says she was just winding Abi up, and the three friends reunite. Jay gains employment from Max but is sacked when Phil refuses to work with Jay, when he has to collect cars from Phil. Abi consoles Jay, and after she is attacked by [[Alexa Smith]] ([[Saffron Coomber]]), Jay comforts her and they declare their love for each other. Jay is later pleased when Lola asks him to be Lexi's godfather, he has doubts whether he will be good enough but Abi's grandmother and Lexi's godmother [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) assures him he will be. In court, Jay is sentenced to community service for his part in Heather's death.\n\nJay, Abi, Lola, [[Dexter Hartman]] (Khali Best), [[Peter Beale]] ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) and [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) go on a caravan holiday, where Abi discovers her period is late and tells Jay that she could be pregnant. Jay and Abi argue because she wants an abortion if she is pregnant, while Jay would rather be a father. Abi is not pregnant but Jay thinks their relationship is over, so kisses barmaid [[List of EastEnders characters (2013)#Kitty|Kitty]] (Chloe May-Cuthill), witnessed by Dexter. Jay and Abi reunite but he feels guilty, and when Kitty keeps calling him, he tells her to stop, but is overheard by Lola. Jay promises Lola that he only loves Abi, and Lola agrees to say nothing to Abi. Dexter reveals Jay's infidelity to Abi in an argument. Abi is devastated, but ultimately forgives Jay.\n\n[[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) is murdered by an unknown assailant (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), and Jay discovers that Max is having a fling with a detective involved in the case, [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]). He agrees to keep quiet for the sake of the investigation. Emma and her colleagues organise an appeal to raise public awareness into the murder inquiry, and display CCTV footage of a man in a beanie hat on the same bus as Lucy on the night she died. Jay is skittish on seeing the footage and later burns the hat. He then makes arrangements to move away with Abi when she gets accepted into the [[University of Bolton|Bolton University]]. On hearing that the police have a new lead on the man on the bus, Jay makes plans to leave for Bolton with Abi immediately after saying goodbye to Phil at a barbecue, but during the proceedings Summerhayes and her superior, [[DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]) arrive and question Jay (as seen in scenes available online) over a robbery at a shop near to where Lucy was killed, and it is revealed he was with another man at the time. He denies any involvement and is released without charge. He later confides in Shirley that he was with Ben on the day Lucy was killed, but he has only seen Ben twice since he was released from prison. Shirley forces him to tell Phil, and his initial anger leads Jay to move in with Abi for a while, and he plans to move to Bolton before Phil marries [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). Jay later reconciles with Phil and reunites him with Ben. It is revealed that, under Ben's instruction, Jay buried Lucy's phone and purse in the allotment. On the day of Sharon and Phil's wedding, Jay and Abi split up when Abi realises Jay is harbouring feelings for Lola. When Phil is accidentally shot by Shirley, Jay and Ben are instructed by [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) to throw the gun in the canal. The Mitchells, including Phil, decide to cover for Shirley by saying that a random person shot Phil.\n\nJay is horrified to discover that Ben and Abi have begun a relationship and Abi later moves in with the Mitchells. Jay develops feelings for Lola again, who rejects Jay's offer to start a relationship. When Max tricks Ben into signing The Arches over to him, Jay discovers that most of the cars he has been fixing are stolen. Phil lets Max believe that the stolen cars have been located by the police and Max signs the business back to Phil. When Ben is arrested on suspicion of killing Lucy, Jay tells Sharon, Lola and Billy that Ben mugged Lucy. Jay and Lola begin a romantic relationship. Jay realises he could be implicated in Lucy's murder, as her phone and wallet have been handed to the police. He leaves Walford, taking Lola and Lexi. They return to Walford the next day to collect their belongings before moving to Newcastle, but when Billy phones the police in a last ditch effort for more time with Lola, Jay is arrested, and Lola and Lexi move to Newcastle alone. Jay receives a suspended prison sentence and a three-month curfew. Although he intends to join her when the curfew is finished, Lola later calls Jay to end their relationship.\n\nJay starts a relationship with [[Linzi Bragg]] ([[Amy-Leigh Hickman]]), but they agree to take things slowly. When they plan to have sex for the first time, and she sends him a video of herself in her new underwear. However, Jay is forced to pick up [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) from school after she gets into a fight. There, Jay discovers Louise was fighting with Linzi, realising that he has been dating a 14-year-old schoolgirl whose real name is Star. Linzi begs Jay not to end their relationship but he tells her to forget that it ever happened, and she reluctantly agrees. Jay then asks Louise not to tell anybody the truth. An unaware Ben texts Linzi from Jay's phone and she comes to Walford but Jay tells her to leave him alone. Linzi is comforted by [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]), who tells Linzi's mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Thelma Bragg|Thelma Bragg]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) about the relationship. Thelma goes to The Queen Vic, asking who has had sex with her 14-year-old daughter; in front of everyone, Bex says it is Jay. At home, Jay explains to his family that he did not have sex with Linzi and ended the relationship as soon as he found out her age, but Phil disowns Jay. Jay is arrested after Thelma calls the police. The photos that Linzi sent Jay are found on his phone, and Jay pleads guilty to save Linzi the ordeal of giving evidence in court and the images being shown. Jay is ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and to sign the [[Sex Offenders Register]] for five years. Phil refuses to harbour Jay after seeing him plead guilty, and when Jay leaves the house, he is cornered by members of Linzi's family and brutally beaten. He spends the night in hospital and then meets Ben, who says he has done nothing wrong and they should carry on as normal, however he is refused service in the pub. Billy allows Jay to stay with him. [[Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]) suggests that he starts working at the undertakers, something her husband [[Les Coker]] ([[Roger Sloman]]) is not impressed with. However, Jay loses the job when they cannot afford to pay him. Jay struggles to live life as a convicted sex offender and when no one will employ him due to his conviction, he turns to drug dealing. Billy discovers this, warning him that he will start using drugs as well. When Honey finds out about the drug dealing and that Billy knew, she evicts them both. Jay tries to steal money from Honey and Billy's wedding fund, but they catch him doing so and Honey calls the police. The police alert social services and Jay decides to move out, so that Billy and Honey's children will not be taken into care.\n\nJay supports Ben after his boyfriend [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]) is killed in a homophobic attack and helps Ben to find the attackers. The killers break into the Mitchells' house and kidnap Jay and Ben, putting them into a back of a van. Ben is rescued by his uncle [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) but Jay is left behind, but escapes when the police arrive. Shortly after giving a statement to the police, Jay decides to leave Walford. However, he is found at a homeless shelter by Pam, who takes him back to the Square and convinces Sharon to let him move back into the Mitchell house and Billy to give him his job back at the funeral home, from which he steals money to give to a drug dealer, [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Mike Rendon|Mike Rendon]] (Bailey Patrick). Mike demands more money, threatening to kill Jay, so Jay steals cash gifts from [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) and [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]]'s ([[Shona McGarty]]) wedding reception. Jay also steals jewellery from a corpse but when Billy's son [[William Mitchell (EastEnders)|Will Mitchell]] (Freddie Phillips) catches him, he returns it. Jay is unable to repay Mike, so Mike forces Jay to deal drugs. Billy finds out and sacks Jay. Phil is released from hospital does not want Jay living in his house, but later Phil promises to help Jay with his problem with Mike, telling him to report Mike to the police. Mike is arrested and Phil lets Jay stay with the Mitchells, and Billy gives him his job back. Jay confides in Billy his fear that no woman will want a relationship with him due to his name being on the sex offenders register, but Billy assures him that he will eventually find the right woman.\n\nPhil decides to give Jay the lucrative car lot, and when Jay discovers how much it is worth, he confronts Phil. Phil says that he killed Jay's father, a homeless man who died in a fire at the car lot several years earlier, however, a phone call reveals this as a lie. Jay starts to resent Phil for the death of his apparent father. He decides to stay with his grandfather Bert but Bert returns to Walford unannounced. Bert departs again after talking to Phil and Jay.\n\nIn January 2018, it is revealed that Max had blackmailed Phil into lying to Jay about his father dying and that Jase was Jay's real father after all. Max attempts to return the car lot to Jay, but he says he does not want anything from him. Jay is devastated when Abi dies. Pam returns to Walford and sacks Billy for illegally exhuming a grave and giving the company a bad reputation, so Jay is made acting manager. Jay is less than pleased when all of his roommates have one by one left the Square and he is forced into allowing Billy, Honey and their children to come and live with him to cover the rent. Jay starts to complain of feeling lonely and isolated due to many of his friends leaving and seemingly hitting a dead-end in his love life. Jay strikes up a friendship with [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) when she returns to Walford in September 2018 and begins to develop feelings for her. Ruby and Jay become close but Ruby is hesitant to take their relationship to the next level as she is coming to terms with having been raped earlier in the year. Jay supports Ruby through this.\n\nLola returns alongside Ben, and their daughter, Lexi. Jay and Lola share several kisses, before Ben reveals to Jay that Lola is [[engaged]]. Lola says that she will leave her fianc\u00e9 but Jay says that he cannot trust her and that they won\u2019t get together. When Ruby returns to the Square, Jay tells her what happened with Lola and apologises. Ruby forgives him and Jay tells her he would like them to be in a relationship. Deciding she is ready to move on with her life, Ruby agrees.\n\n==Casting and development==\n[[File:Jay Brown (2007).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Jay as he appeared in 2007.]]\nBorthwick was 12 years old when he joined the cast of ''EastEnders''.

He made his first appearance on 14 December 2006.\n\nJay's storylines include being part of a gang, coping with the death of his father [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]), being orphaned by age 14 which results in his going into [[foster care]] and then being taken care of by the [[Mitchell family]], as well as maturing from a wayward teen, becoming a surrogate brother to [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Max Bowden), helping Ben cover up the murder of [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), being arrested for having indecent images of a child on his mobile phone after discovering his girlfriend [[Linzi Bragg]] ([[Amy-Leigh Hickman]]) is below the [[age of consent]], drug dealing and developing a drug habit by taking cocaine. In August 2017, in a [[List of EastEnders two-hander episodes#Phil and Jay (21 August 2017)|two-hander episode between Phil and Jay]], Jay finds out that Phil accidentally killed his biological father, a homeless boy who was at the car lot the night that Phil set it alight, however, this is later revealed to be a lie. When [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) returns in 2018, they embark on a fling which later returns into a relationship. However, [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]) returns in 2019 causing chaos. Lola tells Jay that she is engaged and Jay and Ruby make their relationship official.\n\n==Storylines==\nJay is mentioned in 2006 when his dying grandmother [[Evie Brown]] ([[Marji Campi]]) tells his grandfather [[Bert Atkinson]] ([[Dave Hill (actor)|Dave Hill]]) that he has a grandson. Their daughter, Karen, is Jay's mother who died from [[breast cancer]]. Jay appears after Evie's funeral, when he is taken to live with Bert in [[Walford]], per Evie's wishes. Jay is a troublesome youth: he steals, breaks into [[Pauline Fowler]]'s ([[Wendy Richard]]) house, and offends [[Yolande Trueman]] ([[Angela Wynter]]) with a racist slur to impress his peers. When Jay's father [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]) arrives, Bert leaves to allow Jay and Jase to bond. Jay continues getting into trouble, becoming involved with a gang of older boys, known as the E20 crew, led by [[Tegs Teague]] ([[Ben Smith (actor)|Ben Smith]]). Jay helps them shoplift, and they give him a knife. The gang terrorises [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) and Jay steals her keys so they can break into her house. The gang orders Jay to throw a brick through Dot's window, but realising it is wrong, Jay refuses and is rejected from the gang. Tegs later confronts Jay and a fight ensues, with Jay being stabbed in the leg. Tegs is arrested and his mother [[Tina Teague]] (Kerry Ann White) tries to threaten Jay from testifying against her son at his trial. However, she is scared off by Jase's girlfriend [[Dawn Swann]] ([[Kara Tointon]]). Jay gives evidence at the trial and Tegs is sentenced to two years in a Young Offenders Institute.\n\nJay and Jase try to flee Walford when Jase double-crosses a [[football firm]] but Dawn stops their departure by setting a date for her and Jase's wedding. The firm, led by [[Terry Bates (EastEnders)|Terry Bates]] ([[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]]), holds Jay hostage to get revenge on Jase. Jase is able to save Jay with [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) help but is beaten to death by Terry's men, and Billy, too frightened to intervene, leaves Jase to die. Jay accuses Dawn of causing his father's death and goes into care to get away from her. Jay is later fostered by Billy, who is wracked with guilt for not saving Jase from the gang. Jay's behaviour worsens when he plans an arson attack on Dawn, but Billy is able to stop him and Jay eventually makes amends with Dawn. Jay and Billy move into a flat with [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), who tries to get rid of Jay by stealing and blaming it on him. Feeling unwanted, Jay befriends [[Marissa Moore]] ([[Finn Atkins]]), who works at a [[brothel]], and they plan to run away together. When Marissa backs out, Jay runs away alone and sleeps rough, until Billy convinces him to move back in.

Phil gives Jay a job as a mechanic and they bond. Phil is proud of Jay when he overpowers [[Connor Stanley]] ([[Arinze Kene]]), a man who sells stolen goods for Phil. In doing so, Jay stops Connor stealing Phil's profits. Impressed with Jay's courage, Phil is pleased when Jay decides to change his surname to Mitchell, though it upsets Phil's son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe). Despite initial animosity between Ben and Jay, they grow fond of each other, referring to themselves as \"brothers\". Jay starts dating [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) despite objections from her father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]), who thinks Jay is only interested in sex. Jay and Abi do plan to have sex several times, but on each occasion, they are unable to go through with it. Despite Abi's insecurities over Jay's friendship with [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), she and Jay remain together, and eventually Max comes to accept them as a couple.\n\nIn 2012, Phil is imprisoned for the murder of his ex-partner [[Stella Crawford]] ([[Sophie Thompson]]), who abused Ben then jumped from a building in 2007 after Phil confronted her. It transpires that Ben is behind Phil's arrest, having given a false testimony to the police to punish his father for rejecting him for being gay. Ben admits giving false testimony to his half-brother, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), but [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Ferguson]]) overhears. Although it is Ian who tells the police about Ben's lie, Ben assumes it is Heather; he confronts her and in a rage, strikes her over the head with a picture frame, killing her. Jay witnesses the murder and is persuaded by Phil, who has just been released from prison, to cover-up Ben's involvement. Jay is traumatised by the murder and incensed to discover Ben has kept evidence to frame him for Heather's murder, should he need to. When Heather's finac\u00e9 [[Andrew Cotton]] ([[Ricky Grover]]) is falsely charged with Heather's murder, Jay is unable to see him sent to prison and tells the police Andrew is innocent, saying he saw him elsewhere at the time of Heather's murder; Andrew is released without charge. With Phil and Ben frequently fighting in the wake of the cover-up, Jay decides he cannot remain living with them and moves in with Abi's family. However, after a long discussion with Max, Jay returns home to live with Phil and his partner [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who is unaware of Jay's involvement in Heather's death as she was Heather's best friend. Jay is upset when he discovers Abi is planning to go to [[Costa Rica]] and proposes to her. She tells him she does not want to be a young bride and leaves for Costa Rica, leaving him heartbroken. Jay seeks comfort in Lola, and after breaking into [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, Lola kisses a stunned Jay. While cleaning under Ben's bed, Jay finds the photo frame that Ben used to murder Heather. Horrified, Jay wants to report Ben to the police, but Ben hides the frame in a bin bag. They both agree to dispose of the frame but later find it is missing, as it has been handed in to the local charity shop.\n\nJay supports Lola through her labour and bonds with the baby, [[Lexi Pearce|Lexi]], in the absence of the biological father. Shirley eventually uncovers the truth about Heather's murder and is horrified that Phil and Jay knew. Ben confesses to the police and they find the photo frame. Jay then backs up Ben's story, is charged with [[perverting the course of justice]] and released on bail to live with Billy (unable to return to Phil's as he is a witness). Jay visits Phil, who orders him to change his statement so Ben will not go to prison. However, Jay refuses and Phil disowns him. Jay is comforted by [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]). Billy then tells Jay he cannot stay with him; Jay brands him a coward, and breaks down as he misses his father. He is forced to sleep rough and [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) lets him in for food and drink until her husband [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) turns him away. Jay then secretly sees Lola but she is scared of him and tells him not to go near Lexi. Rejected by the rest of the community, Jay then stays with Patrick, who has offered him a place to stay. Abi returns from her trip and learns from her parents about Jay's involvement in Heather's murder, and she rejects him. The next day she tells him he should have done more to stop Ben. He resumes his friendship with Lola and helps her steal cleaning supplies to make money, and they end up sharing a kiss in front of Abi. Abi insists she is happy for them both, however, Lola says she was just winding Abi up, and the three friends reunite.

Jay and Abi argue because she wants an abortion if she is pregnant, while Jay would rather be a father. Abi is not pregnant but Jay thinks their relationship is over, so kisses barmaid [[List of EastEnders characters (2013)#Kitty|Kitty]] (Chloe May-Cuthill), witnessed by Dexter. Jay and Abi reunite but he feels guilty, and when Kitty keeps calling him, he tells her to stop, but is overheard by Lola. Jay promises Lola that he only loves Abi, and Lola agrees to say nothing to Abi. Dexter reveals Jay's infidelity to Abi in an argument. Abi is devastated, but ultimately forgives Jay.\n\n[[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) is murdered by an unknown assailant (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]), and Jay discovers that Max is having a fling with a detective involved in the case, [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]). He agrees to keep quiet for the sake of the investigation. Emma and her colleagues organise an appeal to raise public awareness into the murder inquiry, and display CCTV footage of a man in a beanie hat on the same bus as Lucy on the night she died. Jay is skittish on seeing the footage and later burns the hat. He then makes arrangements to move away with Abi when she gets accepted into the [[University of Bolton|Bolton University]]. On hearing that the police have a new lead on the man on the bus, Jay makes plans to leave for Bolton with Abi immediately after saying goodbye to Phil at a barbecue, but during the proceedings Summerhayes and her superior, [[DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]) arrive and question Jay (as seen in scenes available online) over a robbery at a shop near to where Lucy was killed, and it is revealed he was with another man at the time. He denies any involvement and is released without charge. He later confides in Shirley that he was with Ben on the day Lucy was killed, but he has only seen Ben twice since he was released from prison. Shirley forces him to tell Phil, and his initial anger leads Jay to move in with Abi for a while, and he plans to move to Bolton before Phil marries [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). Jay later reconciles with Phil and reunites him with Ben. It is revealed that, under Ben's instruction, Jay buried Lucy's phone and purse in the allotment. On the day of Sharon and Phil's wedding, Jay and Abi split up when Abi realises Jay is harbouring feelings for Lola. When Phil is accidentally shot by Shirley, Jay and Ben are instructed by [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) to throw the gun in the canal. The Mitchells, including Phil, decide to cover for Shirley by saying that a random person shot Phil.\n\nJay is horrified to discover that Ben and Abi have begun a relationship and Abi later moves in with the Mitchells. Jay develops feelings for Lola again, who rejects Jay's offer to start a relationship. When Max tricks Ben into signing The Arches over to him, Jay discovers that most of the cars he has been fixing are stolen. Phil lets Max believe that the stolen cars have been located by the police and Max signs the business back to Phil. When Ben is arrested on suspicion of killing Lucy, Jay tells Sharon, Lola and Billy that Ben mugged Lucy. Jay and Lola begin a romantic relationship. Jay realises he could be implicated in Lucy's murder, as her phone and wallet have been handed to the police. He leaves Walford, taking Lola and Lexi.

Jay receives a suspended prison sentence and a three-month curfew.

However, Jay is forced to pick up [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]) from school after she gets into a fight. There, Jay discovers Louise was fighting with Linzi, realising that he has been dating a 14-year-old schoolgirl whose real name is Star. Linzi begs Jay not to end their relationship but he tells her to forget that it ever happened, and she reluctantly agrees. Jay then asks Louise not to tell anybody the truth. An unaware Ben texts Linzi from Jay's phone and she comes to Walford but Jay tells her to leave him alone. Linzi is comforted by [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]), who tells Linzi's mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Thelma Bragg|Thelma Bragg]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) about the relationship. Thelma goes to The Queen Vic, asking who has had sex with her 14-year-old daughter; in front of everyone, Bex says it is Jay. At home, Jay explains to his family that he did not have sex with Linzi and ended the relationship as soon as he found out her age, but Phil disowns Jay. Jay is arrested after Thelma calls the police. The photos that Linzi sent Jay are found on his phone, and Jay pleads guilty to save Linzi the ordeal of giving evidence in court and the images being shown.

However, Jay loses the job when they cannot afford to pay him. Jay struggles to live life as a convicted sex offender and when no one will employ him due to his conviction, he turns to drug dealing. Billy discovers this, warning him that he will start using drugs as well. When Honey finds out about the drug dealing and that Billy knew, she evicts them both. Jay tries to steal money from Honey and Billy's wedding fund, but they catch him doing so and Honey calls the police. The police alert social services and Jay decides to move out, so that Billy and Honey's children will not be taken into care.\n\nJay supports Ben after his boyfriend [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]) is killed in a homophobic attack and helps Ben to find the attackers. The killers break into the Mitchells' house and kidnap Jay and Ben, putting them into a back of a van. Ben is rescued by his uncle [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) but Jay is left behind, but escapes when the police arrive. Shortly after giving a statement to the police, Jay decides to leave Walford. However, he is found at a homeless shelter by Pam, who takes him back to the Square and convinces Sharon to let him move back into the Mitchell house and Billy to give him his job back at the funeral home, from which he steals money to give to a drug dealer, [[List of EastEnders characters (2016)#Mike Rendon|Mike Rendon]] (Bailey Patrick).

Beech (center) and sugar maple (bottom left) dominate the forest due to their towering height and tolerance of shade.]]\nIn [[ecology|scientific ecology]] '''climax community''', or '''climatic climax community''', is a historic term for a boreal forest [[Community (ecology)|community]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]] which, through the process of [[ecological succession]]  in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a [[steady state]]. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area.  The term is sometimes also applied in [[soil]] development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a \"steady state\" is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.\n\nThe idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with [[Frederic Clements]] in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry Cowles]] in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term \"climax\" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.<ref>Cowles, Henry Chandler (1899). \"The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan\". ''Botanical Gazette'' 27(2): 95-117; 27(3): 167-202; 27(4): 281-308; 27(5): 361-391.</ref>\n\n==Frederic Clements' use of \"climax\"== \nClements described the successional development of an ecological communities comparable to the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] development of individual [[organism]]s.<ref>Clements, Frederic E. 1916. Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation. Washington D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington.</ref> Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms.<ref>Hagen, Joel B. 1992. An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.</ref> Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a \"[[superorganism]]\" and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist [[Arthur Tansley]] developed this idea with the \"polyclimax\"\u2014multiple steady-state end-points, determined by [[edaphic]] factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable because by definition, climax [[vegetation]] is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. [[Henry Gleason]]'s early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both [[theoretical ecology]] and in vegetation management.  Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, [[plagioclimax]] and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.\n\nThough the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community\u2014of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions\u2014as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there when those conditions occur.

Beech (center) and sugar maple (bottom left) dominate the forest due to their towering height and tolerance of shade.]]\nIn [[ecology|scientific ecology]] '''climax community''', or '''climatic climax community''', is a historic term for a boreal forest [[Community (ecology)|community]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]] which, through the process of [[ecological succession]]  in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a [[steady state]]. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area.  The term is sometimes also applied in [[soil]] development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a \"steady state\" is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.\n\nThe idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with [[Frederic Clements]] in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry Cowles]] in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term \"climax\" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.<ref>Cowles, Henry Chandler (1899). \"The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan\". ''Botanical Gazette'' 27(2): 95-117; 27(3): 167-202; 27(4): 281-308; 27(5): 361-391.</ref>\n\n==Frederic Clements' use of \"climax\"== \nClements described the successional development of an ecological communities comparable to the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] development of individual [[organism]]s.<ref>Clements, Frederic E. 1916. Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation. Washington D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington.</ref> Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms.<ref>Hagen, Joel B. 1992. An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.</ref> Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a \"[[superorganism]]\" and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist [[Arthur Tansley]] developed this idea with the \"polyclimax\"\u2014multiple steady-state end-points, determined by [[edaphic]] factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable because by definition, climax [[vegetation]] is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. [[Henry Gleason]]'s early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both [[theoretical ecology]] and in vegetation management.  Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, [[plagioclimax]] and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.\n\nThough the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community\u2014of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions\u2014as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there when those conditions occur. But much of Clements's work was devoted to characterizing what happens when those ideal conditions do not occur. In those circumstances, vegetation other than the ideal climax will often occur instead. But those different kinds of vegetation can still be described as deviations from the climax ideal. Therefore, Clements developed a very large vocabulary of theoretical terms describing the various possible causes of vegetation, and various non-climax states vegetation adopts as a consequence.

In 1922, it [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] other former territories of the empire to become the [[Soviet Union]]. After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe and helped establish communist states in these countries. Most communist states in Eastern Europe were [[Warsaw Pact|allied]] with the Soviet Union, except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which declared itself [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]]. After a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japanese occupation]] and a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resulting in a [[Communist Party of China|communist]] victory, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949. Communist states were also established in [[Cambodia]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. A communist state was established in [[North Korea]], although it later adopted its own ideology called ''[[Juche]]''. In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed under public pressure during a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of non-violent movements]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.\n\nToday, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. These communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries, but to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam's Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was re-unified under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|communist party]] in 1976<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty\".</ref> and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|communist party]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From Article 5: \"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart\u00ed's ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society\".</ref>\n\n=== Institutions ===\nCommunist states share similar institutions which are organized on the premise that the [[communist party]] is a [[Vanguardism|vanguard of the proletariat]] and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of [[democratic centralism]], developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large.<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\">Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 8\u20139.</ref> According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached all people have a duty to account to that decision. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a [[One-party state|one-party system]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\"/> The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 12.</ref> They recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of [[Representative democracy|representative]] parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a [[separation of powers]] and instead have one national legislative body (such as the [[Supreme Soviet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn communist states, national legislative politics often has a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in [[Liberal democracy|liberal republics]], with two significant differences. First, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but rather the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against [[Karl Marx]]'s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 14.</ref> When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a [[presidium]]) which combines legislative and executive power and in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990) acts as a collective [[head of state]]. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law.\n\nA feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ([[Club (organization)|associations]] of journalists, teachers, writers and other professionals, [[consumer cooperatives]], [[sports club]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[youth organization]]s and [[women's organization]]s) which are integrated into the political system. In communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nHistorically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some communist governments such as those in [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)#1948\u20131990|Czechoslovakia]] or [[National Front (East Germany)|East Germany]] have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracies]] without seeking to establish a one-party state and therefore these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. In most of Europe, communist parties were highly popular and served in several coalition governments during the 20th century. Examples of direct ruling include [[San Marino]] (1945\u20131957), [[Nicaragua]] (1984\u20131990),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/15/world/nicaragua-s-communist-party-shifts-to-opposition.html|work=The New York Times|first=Stephen|last=Kinzer|title=Nicaragua's Communist Party shifts to oppostion|date=15 January 1987|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> [[Guyana]] (1992\u20132015), [[Moldova]] (2001\u20132009),<ref>Marandici, Ion (23 April 2010).

The state is not \"abolished\". It dies out\".{{sfn|Iman|1986|p=383}}\n\nThe introduction of the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union got many communists to believe that the withering away of the state was imminent.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} However, [[Joseph Stalin]] warned that the [[withering away of the state]] would not occur until after the [[socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] had achieved dominance over capitalism.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} Soviet jurist [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] echoed this assumption and said that the socialist state was necessary \"in order to defend, to secure, and to develop relationships and arrangements advantageous to the workers, and to annihilate completely capitalism and its remnants\".{{sfn|Guns|1950|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nIdeology permeates these states.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} According to scholar Peter Tang, \"[t]he supreme test of whether a Communist Party-state remains revolutionarily dedicated or degenerates into a revisionist or counterrevolutionary system lies in its attitude toward the Communist ideology\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} Therefore, the sole ideological purpose of communist states it to spread socialism and to reach that goal these states have to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism\u2013Leninism through the party (Soviet model), or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism\u2013Leninism (Maoist China\u2013Albania model).{{sfn|Tang|1980|pp=42\u201343}} The Soviet model is the most common and is currently in use China.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}}\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was mentioned in the [[Soviet constitution]].{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} Article 6 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution]] stated: \"The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspective of the development of society and the course of the domestic and foreign policy of the USSR\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} This contrasts with the 1976 Albanian constitution which stated in Article 3: \"In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania the dominant ideology is Marxism-Leninism. The entire social order is developing on the basis of its principles\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The [[1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1975 Chinese constitution]] had a similar tone, stating in Article 2 that \"Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking of our nation\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The 1977 Soviet constitution did also use phrases such as \"building socialism and communism\", \"on the road to communism\", \"to build the material and technical basis of communism\" and \"to perfect socialist social relations and transform them into communist relations\" in the preamble.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}}\n\n=== People's democratic state ===\nThe [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democratic state]] was implemented in Eastern Europe after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=16}} It can be defined as a state and society in which feudal vestiges have been liquidated and where the system of private ownership exists, but it is eclipsed by the state-owned enterprises in the field of industry, transport and credit.{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\nIn the words of [[Eugene Varga]], \"the state itself and its apparatus of violence serve the interests, not of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, but of the toilers of town and country\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}} Soviet philosopher N. P. Farberov stated: \"People's democracy in the people's republics is a democracy of the toiling classes, headed by the working class, a broad and full democracy for the overwhelming majority of the people, that is, a socialist democracy in its character and its trend. In this sense we call it popular\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\n=== People's republican state ===\nThe [[People's republic|people's republican state]] is a type of socialist state with a republican constitution. Although the term initially became associated with [[populist]] movements in the 19th century such as the German [[V\u00f6lkisch movement]] and the [[Narodniks]] in Russia, it is now associated to communist states. A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during [[World War I]] and [[Aftermath of World War I|its aftermath]] called themselves people's republics. Many of these sprang up in the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] following the [[October Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC|first=Anders|last=\u00c5slund|publisher=Peterson Institute|year=2009|isbn=9780881325461|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwNeAgAAQBAJ|first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135940102|page=296}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Power, Networks and Violent Conflict in Central Asia: A Comparison of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vv7pAwAAQBAJ|first=Idil|last=Tun\u00e7er-K\u0131lavuz|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317805113|series=Routledge advances in Central Asian studies|volume=Volume 5|page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mongolic Elements in Tuvan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zddhapKVdHMC|first=Bayarma|last=Khabtagaeva|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2009|isbn=9783447060950|series=Turcologica Series|volume=Volume 81|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Peoples of Eastern Asia|volume=Volume 8: Mongolia\u2013Nepal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAmmZ5kMC|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2004|first1=Fiona|last1=Macdonald|first2=Gillian|last2=Stacey|first3=Philip|last3=Steele|isbn=9780761475477|page=413}}</ref>\n\nAdditional people's republics emerged following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in World War II, mainly within the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Democratisation and Institutional Reform in Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5FODwAAQBAJ|first=Elvin|last=Gjevori|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319730714|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bulgaria in British Foreign Policy, 1943\u20131949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCw2DgAAQBAJ|first=Marietta|last=Stankova|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2014|series=Anthem Series on Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies|isbn=9781783082353|page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Cabinets in Eastern Europe|doi=10.1057/9781403905215_6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|editor-first1=Jean|editor-last1=Blondel|editor-first2=Ferdinand|editor-last2=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first1=Ferdinand|last1=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first2=Zdenka|last2=Mansfeldov\u00e1|chapter=Chapter 5: Czech Republic|year=2001|isbn=978-1-349-41148-1|page=62}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Labour Law in Hungary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1Ra6WYtqsgC|first=J\u00f3zsef|last=Hajd\u00fa|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2011|isbn=9789041137920|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Legal Reform in Post-Communist Europe: The View from Within|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAiYFR0MPXgC|first1=Stanis\u0142aw|last1=Frankowski|first2=Paul B.|last2=Stephan|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1995|isbn=9780792332183|page=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=NATO and Eastern Europe After 2000: Strategic Interactions with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PE_D8ZewHKQC|first=Laure|last=Paquette|publisher=Nova|year=2001|isbn=9781560729693|page=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ1x7gvwx_8C|first=John R.|last=Lampe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521774017|page=233}}</ref> In Asia, [[China]] became a people's republic following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chinese Revolution of 1949|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev|website=Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=United States Department of State}}</ref> and [[North Korea]] also became a people's republic.<ref>{{cite book|title=North Korea: The Politics of Regime Survival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EHfBQAAQBAJ|first1=Young Whan|last1=Kihl|first2=Hong Nack|last2= Kim|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317463764|page=8}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ceased to use the term people's republic in their official name, replacing it with the term socialist republic as a mark of their ongoing political development.

National-democratic state ===\nThe concept of the national-democratic state tried to theorize how a state could develop socialism by bypassing the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} While the theory of non-capitalist development was first articulated by [[Vladimir Lenin]], the novelty of this concept was applying it to the progressive elements of the [[national liberation movements]] in the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} The term national-democratic state was introduced shortly after the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]], who believed colonies to be mere lackeys of Western imperialism and that the socialist movement few prospects there.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}}\n\nThe countries in which the national liberations movements took power and which instituted an [[anti-imperialist]] foreign policy and sought to construct a form of socialism were considered as national-democratic states by Marxist\u2013Leninists.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} An example of a national-democratic state is Egypt under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] which was committed to constructing [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} With the exception of Cuba, none of these states managed to develop socialism.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to scholar Sylvia Woodby Edington, this might explain why the concept of the national-democratic state \"never received full theoretical elaboration as a political system\".{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} However, one feature was clearly defined, namely that these states did not need to be led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\n=== Socialist-oriented state ===\nA [[socialist-oriented state]] seeks to reach socialism by non-capitalist development.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} As a term, it is substantially different from the concept of the national-democratic state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} The singular difference is that the socialist-oriented state was divided into two stages, firstly into a national-democratic socialist-oriented state and secondly into a people's democratic socialist-oriented state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Countries belonging to the national-democratic socialist-oriented state category were also categorised as national-democratic states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Examples of national-democratic socialist-oriented states are [[Algeria]] ruled by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], [[Ba'athist Iraq]] and [[Socialist Burma]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} In contrast, people's democratic socialist-oriented states had to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism and accept the universal truths of Marxism\u2013Leninism and reject other notions of socialism such as [[African socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\nThe socialist-oriented states had seven defining features, namely they were revolutionary democracies, had a revolutionary-democratic party, class dictatorship, defense of the socialist-oriented states, had organs of socialisation, initiated socialist construction and the type of socialist-oriented state (either national-democratic or people's democratic).{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=22}} The political goal of [[revolutionary democracy]] is to create the conditions for socialism in countries were the social, political and economic conditions for socialism do not exist.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=23}} The second feature to be met is the establishment of a revolutionary-democratic party which has to establish itself as the leading force and guide the state by using Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=24}} While introduced in these states, [[democratic centralism]] is rarely upheld.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}}\n\nUnlike capitalism which is ruled by the bourgeoisie class and socialism were the proletariat leads, the socialist-oriented state represents a broad and heterogeneous group of classes that seek to consolidate national independence.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}} Since the peasantry were usually the largest class in socialist-oriented states, their role were emphasised\u2014similar to the working class in other socialist states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} However, Marxist\u2013Leninist admitted that these states often fell under the control of certain cliques such as the [[Derg|military in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} The establishing of a legal system and coercive institutions are also noted to safeguard the socialist-oriented nature of the state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=44}} The fifth feature is that the media and educational system has to be taken over by the socialist-oriented state while establishing mass organisations to mobilise the populace.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=50\u201352}} Unlike the Soviet economic model, the economy of the socialist-oriented states are [[mixed economies]] that seek to attract [[foreign capital]] and which seeks to maintain and develop the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=54\u201355}} In the words of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], these states were in the process of taking over the [[commanding heights of the economy]] and instituting a state planned economy.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to Soviet sources, only Laos was the one socialist-oriented state that has managed to develop into a socialist state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=61}}\n\n=== Socialist state ===\nA [[socialist state]] is more than a form of government and can only exist in countries with a [[socialist economy]]. There are examples of several states that have instituted a socialist [[form of government]] before achieving socialism. The former socialist states of Eastern Europe were established as people's democracies (a developmental stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]). On the question of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ruled countries of Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union deemed none of them to be socialist states\u2014referring to them as socialist-oriented states. While many countries with constitutional references to socialism and countries ruled by long-standing socialist movements exist, within Marxist\u2013Leninist theory a socialist state is led by a [[communist party]] that has instituted a socialist economy in a given country.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It deals with states that define themselves either as a socialist state or as a state led by a governing Marxist\u2013Leninist party in their constitutions. For this reason alone, these states are often called communist states.{{sfn|Wilczynski|2008|p=21|loc=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as 'Socialist' (not 'Communist'). The second stage (Marx's 'higher phase'), or 'Communism' is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate 'whithering away of the state'.}}{{sfn|Steele|1999|p=45|loc=Among Western journalists the term 'Communist' came to refer exclusively to regimes and movements associated with the Communist International and its offspring: regimes which insisted that they were not communist but socialist, and movements which were barely communist in any sense at all.}}{{sfn|Rosser|2003|p=14|loc=Ironically, the ideological father of communism, Karl Marx, claimed that communism entailed the withering away of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat was to be a strictly temporary phenomenon. Well aware of this, the Soviet Communists never claimed to have achieved communism, always labeling their own system socialist rather than communist and viewing their system as in transition to communism.}}\n\n== Political system ==\n=== Government ===\nIn communist states, the highest administrative agency of state power is the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} It functions as the executive organ of the legislature.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} The [[Supreme Soviet]] has been introduced with variations in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} For most of its existence, the Soviet government was known as the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} and identical names were used for the governments of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]].{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} It was independent of the other central agencies such as the legislature and its presidium, but the Supreme Soviet was empowered to decide on all questions it wished.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|pp=202\u2013203}} The Soviet government was responsible to the legislature and in between sessions of the legislature it reported to the legislature's standing committee.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The standing committee could reorganise and hold the Soviet government accountable, but it could not instruct the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The government was responsible for the overall economic system, public order, foreign relations and defense.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The Soviet model was more or less identically implemented in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, with few exceptions.{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} One exepction was Czechoslovakia, where it had a [[President of Czechoslovakia|president]] and not a collective presidency;{{sfn|Starr|1987|p=64}} and Bulgaria, where the State Council was empowered to instruct the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Dimitrov|2006|p=170}}\n\n=== Legislature ===\n==== Powers and organisation ====\n[[File:Great Hall Of The People At Night.JPG|thumb|The meeting place of the Chinese [[National People's Congress]]]]\nAll state power is unified in the legislature in communist states.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} This is a firm rejection of the [[separation of power]]s found in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The constitution is passed by the legislature and can only be amended by the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Judicial review and extra-parliamentary review were denounced by Soviet legal theorists as bourgeoisie institutions.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} They also perceived it as a limitation of the people's supreme power.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The legislature together with its suborgans was responsible for overseeing the constitutional order.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Since the legislature is the supreme judge of constitutionality, the legislature's own acts cannot, therefore, be unconstitutional.{{sfn|Hazard|1985|p=163}}\n\nThe [[Supreme Soviet]] was the first socialist legislature and the Soviet legislative system has been introduced in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for two or three days each, making it one of the world's first frequently convened legislatures during its existence.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=91}} The same meeting frequency was the norm in the Eastern Bloc countries as well as modern-day China.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|pp=114\u2013115}} China's legislature, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) is modeled on the Soviet one.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=114}} As with the Soviet one, the NPC is the highest organ of the state and elects a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] (the Soviets had a [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Presidium]]), the government and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (the Soviet counterpart being the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]).{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=115}} In addition, all communist states the ruling party has either had a clear majority such as China, or held every seats as they did in the Soviet Union in their national legislature.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=82}}\n\nWestern researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The reason being that there are not significant bodies of political socialization when compared to legislatures in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} While political leaders are often elected as members of socialist legislatures, these post are not relevant to political advancement.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The role of legislatures is different from country to country.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} In the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] did \"little more than listen to statements from Soviet political leaders and to legitimate decisions already made elsewhere\" while in the legislatures of Poland, Vietnam and Yugoslavia it has been more active and had an impact on rule-making.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}}\n\n==== Representativity ====\nBoth Marx and Lenin abhorred the parliamentary systems of [[bourgeois democracy]], but neither of them sought to abolish it.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Lenin wrote that it would be impossible to develop [[proletarian democracy]] without \"without representative institutions\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Both of them considered the governing model of the [[Paris Commune of 1871]] in which executive and legislative were combined in one body to be ideal.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} More importantly, Marx applauded the election process by \"universial suffrage in the various wards and town\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} While the institution of the socialist legislature might not be important in itself, they \"have a place in the literature and rhetoric of the ruling parties which cannot be ignored\u2014in the language of the party's intimacy with working masses, of its alleged knowledge about interests of working people, of social justice and socialist democracy, of the [[mass line]] and learning from the people\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=6}}\n\nBy having legislatures, the Marxist\u2013Leninist parties try to keep ideological consistency between supporting representative institutions and safeguarding the leading role of the party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} The seek to use the legislatures as a linkage between the rulers and the ruled.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} These institutions are representative and usually mirror the population in areas such as [[ethnicity]] and [[language]], \"yet with occupations distributed in a manner skewed towards government officials\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Unlike in liberal democracies, legislatures of communist states are not to act as a forum for conveying demands or interest articulation\u2014they meet too infrequently for this to be the case.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Scholar Daniel Nelson has noted: \"As with the British parliament before the seventeenth-century turmoil secured its supremacy, legislative bodies in communist states physically portray the 'realm' ruled by (to stretch an anaology) 'kings'. Members of the assemblies 'represent' the population to whom the rulers speak and over whom they govern, convening a broader 'segment of society' [...] than the court itself\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Despite this, it does not mean that the communist states use legislatures to strengthen their communication with the populace\u2014the party, rather than the legislature, could take that function.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}}\n\nIdeologically, it has another function, namely to prove that communist states do not only represent the interests of the working class, but all social strata.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} Communist states are committed to establish a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} As is the case in China, national institutions such as the legislature \"must exist which brings together representatives of all nationalities and geographic areas\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} It does not matter if the legislatures only rubber stamp decisions because by having them it shows that communist states are committed to incorporate minorities and areas of the country by included them in the composition of the legislature.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} In this instance, it might mean that its less important what legislatures do and more important who its representatives are.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} A member of a socialist legislature at central and local level is usually either a government or party official, leading figure in their community, or national figure outside the communist party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} This goes to show that legislatures are tools to garner popular support for the government in which leading figures campaign and spread information about the party's policies and ideological development.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}}\n\n=== Military ===\n==== Control ====\nCommunist states have established two types of civil-military systems. The armed forces of most socialist states have historically been state institutions based on the Soviet model,{{sfn|Kramer|1985|p=47}} but in China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam the armed forces are party-state institutions. However, there are several differences between the statist (Soviet) model and the party-state model (China). In the Soviet model, the [[Soviet armed forces]] was led by the Council of Defense (an organ formed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]) while the Council of Ministers was responsible for formulating defense policies.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The party leader was ''[[ex officio]]'' the Chairman of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} Below the Council of Defense, there was the Main Military Council which was responsible for the strategic direction and leadership of the Soviet armed forces.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The working organ of the Council of Defense was the General Staff which was tasked with analysing military and political situations as they developed.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=30}} The party controlled the armed forces through the Main Political Directorate (MPD) of the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], a state organ that functioned \"with the authority of a department of the [[CPSU Central Committe]]\".{{sfn|Loeber|1984|p=13}} The MPD organised political indoctrination and created political control mechanism at the center to the company level in the field.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} Formally, the MPD was responsible for organising party and [[Komsomol]] organs as well as subordinate organs within the armed forces; ensuring that the party and state retains control over the armed forces; evaluates the political performance of officers; supervising the ideological content of the military press; and supervising the political-military training institutes and their ideological content.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} The head of the MPD was ranked fourth in military protocol, but it was not a member of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=3}} The Administrative Organs Department of the CPSU Central Committee was responsible for implementing the party personnel policies and supervised the [[KGB]], the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=19}}\n\nIn the Chinese party-state model, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) is a party institution.{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} In the preamble of the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], it is stated: \"The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) shall uphold its absolute leadership over the People's Liberation Army and other people's armed forces\".{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} The PLA carries out its work in accordance with the instructions of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPSU Central Committe]].{{sfn|Mulvenon|2012|p=251}} [[Mao Zedong]] described the PLA's institutional situation as follows: \"Every communist must grasp the truth, '[[Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]'. Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party\".{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=6}} The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) is both an organ of the state and the party\u2014it is an organ of the CPC Central Committee and an organ of the national legislature, the National People's Congress.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] is ''ex officio'' [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|party CMC Chairman]] and the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] is by right state CMC Chairman.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The composition of the party CMC and the state CMC are identical.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The CMC is responsible for the command of the PLA and determines national defense policies.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} There are fifteen departments that report directly to the CMC and that are responsible for everything from political work to administration of the PLA.<ref name=\"rand\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/09/pla-reforms-and-their-ramifications.html|title=People's Liberation Army Reforms and Their Ramifications|last=Garafola|first=Cristina L.|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> Of significance is that the CMC eclipses by far the prerogatives of the CPSU Administrative Organs Department while the Chinese counterpart to the Main Political Directorate supervises not only the military, but also intelligence, the security services and counterespionage work.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=23}}\n\n==== Representation ====\nUnlike in liberal democracies, active military personnel are members and partake in civilian institutions of governance.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} This is the case in all communist states.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} For instance, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) has elected at least one active military figure to its [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Politburo]] since 1986.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In the 1986\u20132006 period, active military figures sitting in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Central Committee]] stood at an average of 9,2 percent.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} Military figures are also represented in the national legislature (the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]]) and other representative institutions.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In China, the two [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|CMC vice chairmen]] have had by right office seats in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo]] since 1987.{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=4}}\n\n=== Ruling party ===\n==== Leading role ====\nEvery communist state has been led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} This party seeks to represent and articulate the interests of the classes exploited by [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It seeks to lead the exploited classes to achieve communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} However, the party cannot be identified with the exploited class in general.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Its membership is composed of members with advanced consciousness who are above sectional interests.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Therefore, the party represents the advanced section of the exploited classes and through them leads the exploited classes by interpreting the universal laws governing human history towards communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|pp=27\u201328}} \n\nIn ''[[Foundations of Leninism]]'' (1924), [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote that \"the proletariat [working class] needs the Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. [...] But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the [class] dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the [class] dictatorship\".{{sfn|Steiner|1951|p=58}} The current [[Constitution of Vietnam]] states in Article 4 that \"[t]he [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class, simultaneously the vanguard of the toiling people and of the Vietnamese nation, the faithful representative of the interests of the working class, the toiling people, and the whole nation, acting upon the Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s thought, is the leading force of the state and society\".{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}} In a similar form, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) describes itself as \"the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation\".{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}} As noted by both communist parties, the ruling parties of communist states are [[vanguard parties]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] theorised that vanguard parties were \"capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organising the new system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organizing their social life without the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} This idea eventually evolved into the concept of the party's leading role in leading the state{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} as seen in the CPC's self-description and Vietnam's constitution.{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}}{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}}\n\n==== Internal organization ====\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party organises itself around the principle of [[democratic centralism]] and through it the state too.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}} It means that all directing bodies of the party, from top to bottom, shall be elected; that party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective party organizations; that there shall be strict party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority; and that all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all party members.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}}\n\nThe highest organ of a Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party is the party congress.<ref name=\"CConly\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Committee-Soviet-political-body|title=Central Committee|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> The congress elects the central committee and either an auditing commission and a control commission, or both, although not always.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> The central committee is the party's highest decision-making organ in between party congresses and elects a politburo and a secretariat amongst its members as well as the party's leader.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> When the central committee is not in session, the politburo is the highest decision-making organ of the party and the secretariat is the highest administrative organ.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> In certain parties, either the central committee or the politburo elects amongst its members a standing committee of the politburo which acts as the highest decision-making organ in between sessions of the politburo, central committee and the congress. This leadership structure is identical all the way down to the primary party organisation of the ruling party.<ref name=\"CConly\"/>\n\n== Economic system ==\nFrom reading their works, many followers of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] drew the idea that the socialist economy would be based on planning and not market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|pp=1\u20132}} These ideas later developed into the belief that planning was superior to market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} Upon seizing power, the [[Bolsheviks]] began advocating a national state planning system.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] resolved to institute \"the maximum centralisation of production [...] simultaneously striving to establish a unified economic plan\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[Gosplan]], the State Planning Commission, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] and other central planning organs were established during the 1920s in the era of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=9}} On introducing the planning system, it became common belief in the international communist movement that the Soviet planning system was a more advanced form of economic organization then capitalism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}} This led to the system being introduced voluntary in countries such as China, Cuba and Vietnam and in some cases imposed by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}}\n\nIn communist states, the [[Soviet-type economic planning|state planning]] system had five main characteristics.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Firstly, with the exception of the field consumption and employment, practically all decisions were centralized at the top.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Secondly, the system was [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]\u2014the center formulated a plan that was sent down to the level below which would imitate the process and send the plan further down the pyramid.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Thirdly, the plans were binding in nature, i.e. everyone had to follow and meet the goals set forth in it.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Fourtly, the predominace of calculating in physical terms to ensure planned allocation of commodities were not incompatible with planned production.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Finally, money played a passive role within the state sector since the planners focused on physical allocation.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}}\n\nAccording to Michael Ellman, in a [[planned economy]] \"the state owns the land and all other natural resources and all characteristics of the traditional model the enterprises and their productive assets. Collective ownership (e.g. the property of collective farms) also exists, but plays a subsidiary role, and is expected to be temporary\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} The [[private ownership]] of the means of production still exist, although it plays a fairly smaller role.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=23}} Since the class struggle in capitalism is caused by the division between owners of the means of production and the workers who sell their labour, [[state ownership]] (defined as the property of the people in these systems) is considering as a tool to end class struggle and to empower the working class.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=25}}\n\n== Judicial system ==\n=== Constitution ===\n==== Role of constitutions ====\n[[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] view the [[constitution]] as a [[Organic law|fundamental law]] and as an instrument of force.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=520}} The constitution is the source of law and legality.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} Unlike in [[liberal democracies]], the Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is not a framework to limit the power of the state.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} To the contrary, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution seeks to empower the state\u2014believing the state to be an organ of class domination and law to be the expression of the interests of the dominant class.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} It is the belief of Marxist\u2013Leninists that all national constitutions do this to ensure that countries can strengthen and enforce their own class system.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} In this instance, it means that Marxist\u2013Leninists conceive of constitutions as a tool to defend the socialist nature of the state and attack its enemies.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} This contrasts with the liberal conception of [[constitutionalism]] that \"law, rather than men, is supreme\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xi}}\n\nUnlike the fixed nature of liberal democratic constitutions, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is ever-changing.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], a [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]] during the 1930s, notes that the \"Soviet constitutions represent the sum total of the historic path along which the Soviet state has traveled. At the same time, they are the legislative basis of subsequent development of state life\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} That is, the constitution sums up what already has been achieved.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This belief is also shared by the [[Communist Party of China]] which argued that \"the Chinese Constitution blazes a path for China, recording what has been won in China and what is yet to be conquered\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} A constitution in a communist state has an end.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}} For instance, the preamble of the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Chinese constitution]] outlines the historical tasks of the Chinese communists, \"step by step, to bring about the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist industrialisation of the country]] and, step by step, to accomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft and [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist industry and commerce]]\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}}\n\nIn communist states, the constitution was a tool to analyse the development of society.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} The Marxist\u2013Leninist party in question would have to study the correlation of forces, literally society's class structure, before enacting changes.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} Several terms were coined for different developmental states by Marxist\u2013Leninists legal theorists, including [[New Democracy|new democracy]], [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democracy]] and the [[primary stage of socialism]].{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This is also why amendments to constitutions are not enough and major societal changes need a constitution which corresponds with the reality of the new class structure.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}}\n\nWith [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|repudiation of Stalin's practices]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]'s repudiation of certain [[Maoist]] policies, Marxist\u2013Leninist legal theories began to emphasise \"the formal, formerly neglected constitutional order\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xiii}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], not long after [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] 's death, noted that \"[d]emocracy has to be institutionalised and written into law, so as to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes or whenever the leaders change their views. [...] The trouble now is that our legal system is incomplete. [...] Very often what leaders say is taken as law and anyone who disagrees is called a lawbreaker\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=112}} In 1986, Li Buyan wrote that \"the policies of the Party usually are regulations and calls which to a certain extent are only principles. The law is different; it is rigorously standardised. It explicitly and concretely stipulates what the people should, can or cannot do\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=114}} These legal developments have been echoed in later years in Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. This has led to the development of the communist concept of socialist rule of law which runs parallel to and is disctint to the [[Rule of law|liberal term]] of the same name.{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=118}} In the last years, this emphasization on the constitution as both a legal document and a paper which documents society's development has been noted by [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], who stated in 2013 that \"[n]o organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the Constitution and law\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/03/chinas-constitution-debate-hits-a-sensitive-nerve/|title=China's constitution debate hits a sensitive nerve|last1=Wan|first1=William|last2=Qi|first2=Li|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Constitutional supervision ====\nAfter [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, several communist states have experimented with some sort of constitutional supervision.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} These organs were designed to safeguard the supreme power of the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was the first to experiment with constitutional supervision when it established a Constitutional Committee in 1965.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was elected by the legislature and leading jurists sat in the committee, but it was only empowered to advice the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Keith Hand has commented that \"[i]t was not an effective institution in practice\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} \n\n[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] experimented with constitutional supervision in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Hungary established the Council of Constitutional Law which was elected by the legislature and consisted of several leading jurists.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was empowered to review the constitutionality and legality of statutes, administrative regulations and other normative documents; however, if the agency in question failed to heed its advice, it needed to petition the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} In 1989, the Soviets established the Constitutional Supervision Committee which \"was subordinate only to the USSR constitution\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} It was empowered \"to review the constitutionality and legality of a range of state acts of the USSR and its republics. Its jurisdiction included laws [passed by the legislature], decrees of the Supreme Soviet\u2019s Presidium, union republic constitutions and laws, some central administrative decrees, Supreme Court explanations, and other central normative documents\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} If the committee deemed the legislature to have breached legality, the legislature was obliged to discuss the issue, but it could reject it if more than two-thirds voted against the findings of the Constitutional Supervision Committee.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} While it was constitutionally powerful, it lacked enforcement powers, it was often ignored and it failed to defend the constitution during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=5}} \n\nThe [[Generations of Chinese leadership|Chinese leadership]] has argued against establishing a constitutional supervisory committee due to their association with failed communist states of Europe.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=15}} None of the surviving communist states (China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam) have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of anykind outside the existing framework.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=16}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\n{{main|Socialist law}}\nAll communist states have been established in countries with a [[civil law system]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} The countries of Eastern Europe had formally been governed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]]\u2014all of whom had civil law legal system.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Cuba had a civil law system imposed on them by Spain while China introduced civil law to overlay with Confucian elements and Vietnam used French law.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, there has been a scholarly debate on whether [[socialist law]] is a separate legal system or is a part of the civil law tradition.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Legal scholar Ren\u00e8 David wrote that the socialist legal system \"possesses, in relation to our French law, particular features that give it a complete originality, to the extent that it is no longer possible to connect it, like the former Russian law, to the system of [[Roman law]]\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=782}} Similarly, Christoper Osakwe concludes that socialist law is \"an autonomous legal system to be essentially distinguished from the other contemporary families of law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}} Proponents of socialist law as a separate legal system, have identified the following features:{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is to disappear with the [[withering away of the state]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The rule of the Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is subordinate and reflect changes to the economic order (the absorption of [[private law]] by [[public law]]).{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law has a religious character.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n# The socialist law is [[prerogative]] rather than [[normative]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n\nLegal officials argue differently for their case than Westerners.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} For instance, \"[t]he predominant view among Soviet jurists in the 1920s was that Soviet law of that period was Western-style law appropriate for a Soviet economy that remained capitalist to a significant degree\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} This changed with the introduction of the [[planned economy]] and the term socialist law was conceived to reflect this in the 1930s.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} Hungarian legal theorist Imre Szab\u00f3 acknowledged similarities between socialist law and civil law, but he noted that \"four basic types of law may be distinguished: the laws of the slave, feudal, capitalist and socialist societies\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|pp=798\u201399}} Using the Marxst theory of [[historical materialism]], Szab\u00f3 argues that socialist law cannot belong to the same law family since the material structure is different  from the capitalist countries as their superstructure (state) has to reflect these differences.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} In other words, law is a tool by the [[ruling class]] to govern.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} As Ren\u00e8 David notes, socialist jurists \"isolate their law, to put into another category, a reprobate category, the Romanist laws and the common law, is the fact that they reason less as jurists and more as philosophers and Marxists; it is in taking a not strictly legal viewpoint that they affirm the originality of their socialist law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=797}} However, some socialist legal theorists such as Romanian jurist Victor Zlatescu differentiated between type of law and family of law. According to Zlatescu, \"[t]he distinction between the law of the socialist countries and the law of the capitalist countries is not of the same nature as the difference between Roman-German law and the common law, for example. Socialist law is not a third family among the others, as appears in certain writings of Western comparatists\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}} In other words, socialist law is civil law, but it is a different type of law for a different type of society.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}}\n\nYugoslav jurist Borislav Blagojevic noted that a \"great number of legal institutions and legal relations remain the same in socialist law\", further stating that it is \"necessary and justified\" to put them to use if they are \"in conformity with the corresponding interests of the ruling class in the state in question\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=802}} Importantly, socialist law has retained civil law institutions, methodology and organization.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}} This can be discerned by the fact that [[East Germany]] retained the [[1896 German civil code]] until 1976 while [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] used existing Austrian, French, German and Russian civil codes until its adoption of its own civil code in 1964.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=801}} Scholar John Quigley wrote that \"[s]ocialist law retains the inquisitorial style of trial, law-creation predominantly by legislatures rather than courts, and a significant role for legal scholarship in construing codes\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}}\n\n== List of communist states ==\n=== Current communist states ===\nThe following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined.

In 1922, it [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] other former territories of the empire to become the [[Soviet Union]]. After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe and helped establish communist states in these countries. Most communist states in Eastern Europe were [[Warsaw Pact|allied]] with the Soviet Union, except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which declared itself [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]]. After a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japanese occupation]] and a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resulting in a [[Communist Party of China|communist]] victory, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949. Communist states were also established in [[Cambodia]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. A communist state was established in [[North Korea]], although it later adopted its own ideology called ''[[Juche]]''. In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed under public pressure during a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of non-violent movements]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.\n\nToday, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. These communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries, but to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam's Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was re-unified under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|communist party]] in 1976<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty\".</ref> and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|communist party]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From Article 5: \"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart\u00ed's ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society\".</ref>\n\n=== Institutions ===\nCommunist states share similar institutions which are organized on the premise that the [[communist party]] is a [[Vanguardism|vanguard of the proletariat]] and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of [[democratic centralism]], developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large.<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\">Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 8\u20139.</ref> According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached all people have a duty to account to that decision. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a [[One-party state|one-party system]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\"/> The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 12.</ref> They recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of [[Representative democracy|representative]] parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a [[separation of powers]] and instead have one national legislative body (such as the [[Supreme Soviet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn communist states, national legislative politics often has a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in [[Liberal democracy|liberal republics]], with two significant differences. First, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but rather the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against [[Karl Marx]]'s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 14.</ref> When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a [[presidium]]) which combines legislative and executive power and in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990) acts as a collective [[head of state]]. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law.\n\nA feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ([[Club (organization)|associations]] of journalists, teachers, writers and other professionals, [[consumer cooperatives]], [[sports club]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[youth organization]]s and [[women's organization]]s) which are integrated into the political system. In communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nHistorically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some communist governments such as those in [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)#1948\u20131990|Czechoslovakia]] or [[National Front (East Germany)|East Germany]] have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracies]] without seeking to establish a one-party state and therefore these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. In most of Europe, communist parties were highly popular and served in several coalition governments during the 20th century.

The state is not \"abolished\". It dies out\".{{sfn|Iman|1986|p=383}}\n\nThe introduction of the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union got many communists to believe that the withering away of the state was imminent.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} However, [[Joseph Stalin]] warned that the [[withering away of the state]] would not occur until after the [[socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] had achieved dominance over capitalism.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} Soviet jurist [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] echoed this assumption and said that the socialist state was necessary \"in order to defend, to secure, and to develop relationships and arrangements advantageous to the workers, and to annihilate completely capitalism and its remnants\".{{sfn|Guns|1950|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nIdeology permeates these states.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} According to scholar Peter Tang, \"[t]he supreme test of whether a Communist Party-state remains revolutionarily dedicated or degenerates into a revisionist or counterrevolutionary system lies in its attitude toward the Communist ideology\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} Therefore, the sole ideological purpose of communist states it to spread socialism and to reach that goal these states have to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism\u2013Leninism through the party (Soviet model), or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism\u2013Leninism (Maoist China\u2013Albania model).{{sfn|Tang|1980|pp=42\u201343}} The Soviet model is the most common and is currently in use China.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}}\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was mentioned in the [[Soviet constitution]].{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} Article 6 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution]] stated: \"The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspective of the development of society and the course of the domestic and foreign policy of the USSR\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} This contrasts with the 1976 Albanian constitution which stated in Article 3: \"In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania the dominant ideology is Marxism-Leninism. The entire social order is developing on the basis of its principles\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The [[1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1975 Chinese constitution]] had a similar tone, stating in Article 2 that \"Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking of our nation\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The 1977 Soviet constitution did also use phrases such as \"building socialism and communism\", \"on the road to communism\", \"to build the material and technical basis of communism\" and \"to perfect socialist social relations and transform them into communist relations\" in the preamble.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}}\n\n=== People's democratic state ===\nThe [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democratic state]] was implemented in Eastern Europe after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=16}} It can be defined as a state and society in which feudal vestiges have been liquidated and where the system of private ownership exists, but it is eclipsed by the state-owned enterprises in the field of industry, transport and credit.{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\nIn the words of [[Eugene Varga]], \"the state itself and its apparatus of violence serve the interests, not of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, but of the toilers of town and country\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}} Soviet philosopher N. P. Farberov stated: \"People's democracy in the people's republics is a democracy of the toiling classes, headed by the working class, a broad and full democracy for the overwhelming majority of the people, that is, a socialist democracy in its character and its trend. In this sense we call it popular\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\n=== People's republican state ===\nThe [[People's republic|people's republican state]] is a type of socialist state with a republican constitution. Although the term initially became associated with [[populist]] movements in the 19th century such as the German [[V\u00f6lkisch movement]] and the [[Narodniks]] in Russia, it is now associated to communist states. A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during [[World War I]] and [[Aftermath of World War I|its aftermath]] called themselves people's republics. Many of these sprang up in the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] following the [[October Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC|first=Anders|last=\u00c5slund|publisher=Peterson Institute|year=2009|isbn=9780881325461|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwNeAgAAQBAJ|first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135940102|page=296}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Power, Networks and Violent Conflict in Central Asia: A Comparison of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vv7pAwAAQBAJ|first=Idil|last=Tun\u00e7er-K\u0131lavuz|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317805113|series=Routledge advances in Central Asian studies|volume=Volume 5|page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mongolic Elements in Tuvan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zddhapKVdHMC|first=Bayarma|last=Khabtagaeva|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2009|isbn=9783447060950|series=Turcologica Series|volume=Volume 81|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Peoples of Eastern Asia|volume=Volume 8: Mongolia\u2013Nepal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAmmZ5kMC|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2004|first1=Fiona|last1=Macdonald|first2=Gillian|last2=Stacey|first3=Philip|last3=Steele|isbn=9780761475477|page=413}}</ref>\n\nAdditional people's republics emerged following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in World War II, mainly within the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Democratisation and Institutional Reform in Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5FODwAAQBAJ|first=Elvin|last=Gjevori|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319730714|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bulgaria in British Foreign Policy, 1943\u20131949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCw2DgAAQBAJ|first=Marietta|last=Stankova|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2014|series=Anthem Series on Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies|isbn=9781783082353|page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Cabinets in Eastern Europe|doi=10.1057/9781403905215_6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|editor-first1=Jean|editor-last1=Blondel|editor-first2=Ferdinand|editor-last2=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first1=Ferdinand|last1=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first2=Zdenka|last2=Mansfeldov\u00e1|chapter=Chapter 5: Czech Republic|year=2001|isbn=978-1-349-41148-1|page=62}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Labour Law in Hungary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1Ra6WYtqsgC|first=J\u00f3zsef|last=Hajd\u00fa|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2011|isbn=9789041137920|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Legal Reform in Post-Communist Europe: The View from Within|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAiYFR0MPXgC|first1=Stanis\u0142aw|last1=Frankowski|first2=Paul B.|last2=Stephan|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1995|isbn=9780792332183|page=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=NATO and Eastern Europe After 2000: Strategic Interactions with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PE_D8ZewHKQC|first=Laure|last=Paquette|publisher=Nova|year=2001|isbn=9781560729693|page=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ1x7gvwx_8C|first=John R.|last=Lampe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521774017|page=233}}</ref> In Asia, [[China]] became a people's republic following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chinese Revolution of 1949|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev|website=Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=United States Department of State}}</ref> and [[North Korea]] also became a people's republic.<ref>{{cite book|title=North Korea: The Politics of Regime Survival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EHfBQAAQBAJ|first1=Young Whan|last1=Kihl|first2=Hong Nack|last2= Kim|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317463764|page=8}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ceased to use the term people's republic in their official name, replacing it with the term socialist republic as a mark of their ongoing political development.

National-democratic state ===\nThe concept of the national-democratic state tried to theorize how a state could develop socialism by bypassing the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} While the theory of non-capitalist development was first articulated by [[Vladimir Lenin]], the novelty of this concept was applying it to the progressive elements of the [[national liberation movements]] in the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} The term national-democratic state was introduced shortly after the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]], who believed colonies to be mere lackeys of Western imperialism and that the socialist movement few prospects there.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}}\n\nThe countries in which the national liberations movements took power and which instituted an [[anti-imperialist]] foreign policy and sought to construct a form of socialism were considered as national-democratic states by Marxist\u2013Leninists.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} An example of a national-democratic state is Egypt under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] which was committed to constructing [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} With the exception of Cuba, none of these states managed to develop socialism.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to scholar Sylvia Woodby Edington, this might explain why the concept of the national-democratic state \"never received full theoretical elaboration as a political system\".{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} However, one feature was clearly defined,

of national-democratic socialist-oriented states are [[Algeria]] ruled by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], [[Ba'athist Iraq]] and [[Socialist Burma]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} In contrast, people's democratic socialist-oriented states had to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism and accept the universal truths of Marxism\u2013Leninism and reject other notions of socialism such as [[African socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\nThe socialist-oriented states had seven defining features, namely they were revolutionary democracies, had a revolutionary-democratic party, class dictatorship, defense of the socialist-oriented states, had organs of socialisation, initiated socialist construction and the type of socialist-oriented state (either national-democratic or people's democratic).{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=22}} The political goal of [[revolutionary democracy]] is to create the conditions for socialism in countries were the social, political and economic conditions for socialism do not exist.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=23}} The second feature to be met is the establishment of a revolutionary-democratic party which has to establish itself as the leading force and guide the state by using Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=24}} While introduced in these states, [[democratic centralism]] is rarely upheld.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}}\n\nUnlike capitalism which is ruled by the bourgeoisie class and socialism were the proletariat leads, the socialist-oriented state represents a broad and heterogeneous group of classes that seek to consolidate national independence.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}} Since the peasantry were usually the largest class in socialist-oriented states, their role were emphasised\u2014similar to the working class in other socialist states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} However, Marxist\u2013Leninist admitted that these states often fell under the control of certain cliques such as the [[Derg|military in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} The establishing of a legal system and coercive institutions are also noted to safeguard the socialist-oriented nature of the state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=44}} The fifth feature is that the media and educational system has to be taken over by the socialist-oriented state while establishing mass organisations to mobilise the populace.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=50\u201352}} Unlike the Soviet economic model, the economy of the socialist-oriented states are [[mixed economies]] that seek to attract [[foreign capital]] and which seeks to maintain and develop the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=54\u201355}} In the words of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], these states were in the process of taking over the [[commanding heights of the economy]] and instituting a state planned economy.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to Soviet sources, only Laos was the one socialist-oriented state that has managed to develop into a socialist state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=61}}\n\n=== Socialist state ===\nA [[socialist state]] is more than a form of government and can only exist in countries with a [[socialist economy]]. There are examples of several states that have instituted a socialist [[form of government]] before achieving socialism. The former socialist states of Eastern Europe were established as people's democracies (a developmental stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]). On the question of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ruled countries of Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union deemed none of them to be socialist states\u2014referring to them as socialist-oriented states. While many countries with constitutional references to socialism and countries ruled by long-standing socialist movements exist, within Marxist\u2013Leninist theory a socialist state is led by a [[communist party]] that has instituted a socialist economy in a given country.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It deals with states that define themselves either as a socialist state or as a state led by a governing Marxist\u2013Leninist party in their constitutions. For this reason alone, these states are often called communist states.{{sfn|Wilczynski|2008|p=21|loc=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as 'Socialist' (not 'Communist'). The second stage (Marx's 'higher phase'), or 'Communism' is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate 'whithering away of the state'.}}{{sfn|Steele|1999|p=45|loc=Among Western journalists the term 'Communist' came to refer exclusively to regimes and movements associated with the Communist International and its offspring: regimes which insisted that they were not communist but socialist, and movements which were barely communist in any sense at all.}}{{sfn|Rosser|2003|p=14|loc=Ironically, the ideological father of communism, Karl Marx, claimed that communism entailed the withering away of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat was to be a strictly temporary phenomenon. Well aware of this, the Soviet Communists never claimed to have achieved communism, always labeling their own system socialist rather than communist and viewing their system as in transition to communism.}}\n\n== Political system ==\n=== Government ===\nIn communist states, the highest administrative agency of state power is the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} It functions as the executive organ of the legislature.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} The [[Supreme Soviet]] has been introduced with variations in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} For most of its existence, the Soviet government was known as the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} and identical names were used for the governments of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]].{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} It was independent of the other central agencies such as the legislature and its presidium, but the Supreme Soviet was empowered to decide on all questions it wished.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|pp=202\u2013203}} The Soviet government was responsible to the legislature and in between sessions of the legislature it reported to the legislature's standing committee.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The standing committee could reorganise and hold the Soviet government accountable, but it could not instruct the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The government was responsible for the overall economic system, public order, foreign relations and defense.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The Soviet model was more or less identically implemented in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, with few exceptions.{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} One exepction was Czechoslovakia, where it had a [[President of Czechoslovakia|president]] and not a collective presidency;{{sfn|Starr|1987|p=64}} and Bulgaria, where the State Council was empowered to instruct the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Dimitrov|2006|p=170}}\n\n=== Legislature ===\n==== Powers and organisation ====\n[[File:Great Hall Of The People At Night.JPG|thumb|The meeting place of the Chinese [[National People's Congress]]]]\nAll state power is unified in the legislature in communist states.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} This is a firm rejection of the [[separation of power]]s found in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The constitution is passed by the legislature and can only be amended by the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Judicial review and extra-parliamentary review were denounced by Soviet legal theorists as bourgeoisie institutions.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} They also perceived it as a limitation of the people's supreme power.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The legislature together with its suborgans was responsible for overseeing the constitutional order.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Since the legislature is the supreme judge of constitutionality, the legislature's own acts cannot, therefore, be unconstitutional.{{sfn|Hazard|1985|p=163}}\n\nThe [[Supreme Soviet]] was the first socialist legislature and the Soviet legislative system has been introduced in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for two or three days each, making it one of the world's first frequently convened legislatures during its existence.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=91}} The same meeting frequency was the norm in the Eastern Bloc countries as well as modern-day China.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|pp=114\u2013115}} China's legislature, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) is modeled on the Soviet one.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=114}} As with the Soviet one, the NPC is the highest organ of the state and elects a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] (the Soviets had a [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Presidium]]), the government and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (the Soviet counterpart being the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]).{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=115}} In addition, all communist states the ruling party has either had a clear majority such as China, or held every seats as they did in the Soviet Union in their national legislature.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=82}}\n\nWestern researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The reason being that there are not significant bodies of political socialization when compared to legislatures in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} While political leaders are often elected as members of socialist legislatures, these post are not relevant to political advancement.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The role of legislatures is different from country to country.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} In the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] did \"little more than listen to statements from Soviet political leaders and to legitimate decisions already made elsewhere\" while in the legislatures of Poland, Vietnam and Yugoslavia it has been more active and had an impact on rule-making.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}}\n\n==== Representativity ====\nBoth Marx and Lenin abhorred the parliamentary systems of [[bourgeois democracy]], but neither of them sought to abolish it.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Lenin wrote that it would be impossible to develop [[proletarian democracy]] without \"without representative institutions\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Both of them considered the governing model of the [[Paris Commune of 1871]] in which executive and legislative were combined in one body to be ideal.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} More importantly, Marx applauded the election process by \"universial suffrage in the various wards and town\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} While the institution of the socialist legislature might not be important in itself, they \"have a place in the literature and rhetoric of the ruling parties which cannot be ignored\u2014in the language of the party's intimacy with working masses, of its alleged knowledge about interests of working people, of social justice and socialist democracy, of the [[mass line]] and learning from the people\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=6}}\n\nBy having legislatures, the Marxist\u2013Leninist parties try to keep ideological consistency between supporting representative institutions and safeguarding the leading role of the party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} The seek to use the legislatures as a linkage between the rulers and the ruled.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} These institutions are representative and usually mirror the population in areas such as [[ethnicity]] and [[language]], \"yet with occupations distributed in a manner skewed towards government officials\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Unlike in liberal democracies, legislatures of communist states are not to act as a forum for conveying demands or interest articulation\u2014they meet too infrequently for this to be the case.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Scholar Daniel Nelson has noted: \"As with the British parliament before the seventeenth-century turmoil secured its supremacy, legislative bodies in communist states physically portray the 'realm' ruled by (to stretch an anaology) 'kings'. Members of the assemblies 'represent' the population to whom the rulers speak and over whom they govern, convening a broader 'segment of society' [...] than the court itself\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Despite this, it does not mean that the communist states use legislatures to strengthen their communication with the populace\u2014the party, rather than the legislature, could take that function.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}}\n\nIdeologically, it has another function, namely to prove that communist states do not only represent the interests of the working class, but all social strata.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} Communist states are committed to establish a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} As is the case in China, national institutions such as the legislature \"must exist which brings together representatives of all nationalities and geographic areas\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} It does not matter if the legislatures only rubber stamp decisions because by having them it shows that communist states are committed to incorporate minorities and areas of the country by included them in the composition of the legislature.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} In this instance, it might mean that its less important what legislatures do and more important who its representatives are.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} A member of a socialist legislature at central and local level is usually either a government or party official, leading figure in their community, or national figure outside the communist party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} This goes to show that legislatures are tools to garner popular support for the government in which leading figures campaign and spread information about the party's policies and ideological development.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}}\n\n=== Military ===\n==== Control ====\nCommunist states have established two types of civil-military systems. The armed forces of most socialist states have historically been state institutions based on the Soviet model,{{sfn|Kramer|1985|p=47}} but in China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam the armed forces are party-state institutions. However, there are several differences between the statist (Soviet) model and the party-state model (China). In the Soviet model, the [[Soviet armed forces]] was led by the Council of Defense (an organ formed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]) while the Council of Ministers was responsible for formulating defense policies.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The party leader was ''[[ex officio]]'' the Chairman of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} Below the Council of Defense, there was the Main Military Council which was responsible for the strategic direction and leadership of the Soviet armed forces.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The working organ of the Council of Defense was the General Staff which was tasked with analysing military and political situations as they developed.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=30}} The party controlled the armed forces through the Main Political Directorate (MPD) of the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], a state organ that functioned \"with the authority of a department of the [[CPSU Central Committe]]\".{{sfn|Loeber|1984|p=13}} The MPD organised political indoctrination and created political control mechanism at the center to the company level in the field.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} Formally, the MPD was responsible for organising party and [[Komsomol]] organs as well as subordinate organs within the armed forces; ensuring that the party and state retains control over the armed forces; evaluates the political performance of officers; supervising the ideological content of the military press; and supervising the political-military training institutes and their ideological content.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} The head of the MPD was ranked fourth in military protocol, but it was not a member of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=3}} The Administrative Organs Department of the CPSU Central Committee was responsible for implementing the party personnel policies and supervised the [[KGB]], the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=19}}\n\nIn the Chinese party-state model, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) is a party institution.{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} In the preamble of the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], it is stated: \"The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) shall uphold its absolute leadership over the People's Liberation Army and other people's armed forces\".{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} The PLA carries out its work in accordance with the instructions of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPSU Central Committe]].{{sfn|Mulvenon|2012|p=251}} [[Mao Zedong]] described the PLA's institutional situation as follows: \"Every communist must grasp the truth, '[[Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]'. Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party\".{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=6}} The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) is both an organ of the state and the party\u2014it is an organ of the CPC Central Committee and an organ of the national legislature, the National People's Congress.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] is ''ex officio'' [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|party CMC Chairman]] and the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] is by right state CMC Chairman.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The composition of the party CMC and the state CMC are identical.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The CMC is responsible for the command of the PLA and determines national defense policies.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} There are fifteen departments that report directly to the CMC and that are responsible for everything from political work to administration of the PLA.<ref name=\"rand\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/09/pla-reforms-and-their-ramifications.html|title=People's Liberation Army Reforms and Their Ramifications|last=Garafola|first=Cristina L.|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> Of significance is that the CMC eclipses by far the prerogatives of the CPSU Administrative Organs Department while the Chinese counterpart to the Main Political Directorate supervises not only the military, but also intelligence, the security services and counterespionage work.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=23}}\n\n==== Representation ====\nUnlike in liberal democracies, active military personnel are members and partake in civilian institutions of governance.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} This is the case in all communist states.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} For instance, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) has elected at least one active military figure to its [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Politburo]] since 1986.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In the 1986\u20132006 period, active military figures sitting in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Central Committee]] stood at an average of 9,2 percent.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} Military figures are also represented in the national legislature (the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]]) and other representative institutions.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In China, the two [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|CMC vice chairmen]] have had by right office seats in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo]] since 1987.{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=4}}\n\n=== Ruling party ===\n==== Leading role ====\nEvery communist state has been led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} This party seeks to represent and articulate the interests of the classes exploited by [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It seeks to lead the exploited classes to achieve communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} However, the party cannot be identified with the exploited class in general.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Its membership is composed of members with advanced consciousness who are above sectional interests.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Therefore, the party represents the advanced section of the exploited classes and through them leads the exploited classes by interpreting the universal laws governing human history towards communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|pp=27\u201328}} \n\nIn ''[[Foundations of Leninism]]'' (1924), [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote that \"the proletariat [working class] needs the Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. [...] But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the [class] dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the [class] dictatorship\".{{sfn|Steiner|1951|p=58}} The current [[Constitution of Vietnam]] states in Article 4 that \"[t]he [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class, simultaneously the vanguard of the toiling people and of the Vietnamese nation, the faithful representative of the interests of the working class, the toiling people, and the whole nation, acting upon the Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s thought, is the leading force of the state and society\".{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}} In a similar form, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) describes itself as \"the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation\".{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}} As noted by both communist parties, the ruling parties of communist states are [[vanguard parties]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] theorised that vanguard parties were \"capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organising the new system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organizing their social life without the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} This idea eventually evolved into the concept of the party's leading role in leading the state{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} as seen in the CPC's self-description and Vietnam's constitution.{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}}{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}}\n\n==== Internal organization ====\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party organises itself around the principle of [[democratic centralism]] and through it the state too.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}} It means that all directing bodies of the party, from top to bottom, shall be elected; that party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective party organizations; that there shall be strict party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority; and that all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all party members.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}}\n\nThe highest organ of a Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party is the party congress.<ref name=\"CConly\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Committee-Soviet-political-body|title=Central Committee|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> The congress elects the central committee and either an auditing commission and a control commission, or both, although not always.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> The central committee is the party's highest decision-making organ in between party congresses and elects a politburo and a secretariat amongst its members as well as the party's leader.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> When the central committee is not in session, the politburo is the highest decision-making organ of the party and the secretariat is the highest administrative organ.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> In certain parties, either the central committee or the politburo elects amongst its members a standing committee of the politburo which acts as the highest decision-making organ in between sessions of the politburo, central committee and the congress. This leadership structure is identical all the way down to the primary party organisation of the ruling party.<ref name=\"CConly\"/>\n\n== Economic system ==\nFrom reading their works, many followers of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] drew the idea that the socialist economy would be based on planning and not market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|pp=1\u20132}} These ideas later developed into the belief that planning was superior to market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} Upon seizing power, the [[Bolsheviks]] began advocating a national state planning system.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] resolved to institute \"the maximum centralisation of production [...] simultaneously striving to establish a unified economic plan\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[Gosplan]], the State Planning Commission, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] and other central planning organs were established during the 1920s in the era of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=9}} On introducing the planning system, it became common belief in the international communist movement that the Soviet planning system was a more advanced form of economic organization then capitalism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}} This led to the system being introduced voluntary in countries such as China, Cuba and Vietnam and in some cases imposed by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}}\n\nIn communist states, the [[Soviet-type economic planning|state planning]] system had five main characteristics.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Firstly, with the exception of the field consumption and employment, practically all decisions were centralized at the top.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Secondly, the system was [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]\u2014the center formulated a plan that was sent down to the level below which would imitate the process and send the plan further down the pyramid.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Thirdly, the plans were binding in nature, i.e. everyone had to follow and meet the goals set forth in it.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Fourtly, the predominace of calculating in physical terms to ensure planned allocation of commodities were not incompatible with planned production.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Finally, money played a passive role within the state sector since the planners focused on physical allocation.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}}\n\nAccording to Michael Ellman, in a [[planned economy]] \"the state owns the land and all other natural resources and all characteristics of the traditional model the enterprises and their productive assets. Collective ownership (e.g. the property of collective farms) also exists, but plays a subsidiary role, and is expected to be temporary\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} The [[private ownership]] of the means of production still exist, although it plays a fairly smaller role.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=23}} Since the class struggle in capitalism is caused by the division between owners of the means of production and the workers who sell their labour, [[state ownership]] (defined as the property of the people in these systems) is considering as a tool to end class struggle and to empower the working class.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=25}}\n\n== Judicial system ==\n=== Constitution ===\n==== Role of constitutions ====\n[[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] view the [[constitution]] as a [[Organic law|fundamental law]] and as an instrument of force.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=520}} The constitution is the source of law and legality.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} Unlike in [[liberal democracies]], the Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is not a framework to limit the power of the state.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} To the contrary, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution seeks to empower the state\u2014believing the state to be an organ of class domination and law to be the expression of the interests of the dominant class.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} It is the belief of Marxist\u2013Leninists that all national constitutions do this to ensure that countries can strengthen and enforce their own class system.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} In this instance, it means that Marxist\u2013Leninists conceive of constitutions as a tool to defend the socialist nature of the state and attack its enemies.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} This contrasts with the liberal conception of [[constitutionalism]] that \"law, rather than men, is supreme\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xi}}\n\nUnlike the fixed nature of liberal democratic constitutions, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is ever-changing.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], a [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]] during the 1930s, notes that the \"Soviet constitutions represent the sum total of the historic path along which the Soviet state has traveled. At the same time, they are the legislative basis of subsequent development of state life\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} That is, the constitution sums up what already has been achieved.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This belief is also shared by the [[Communist Party of China]] which argued that \"the Chinese Constitution blazes a path for China, recording what has been won in China and what is yet to be conquered\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} A constitution in a communist state has an end.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}} For instance, the preamble of the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Chinese constitution]] outlines the historical tasks of the Chinese communists, \"step by step, to bring about the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist industrialisation of the country]] and, step by step, to accomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft and [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist industry and commerce]]\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}}\n\nIn communist states, the constitution was a tool to analyse the development of society.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} The Marxist\u2013Leninist party in question would have to study the correlation of forces, literally society's class structure, before enacting changes.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} Several terms were coined for different developmental states by Marxist\u2013Leninists legal theorists, including [[New Democracy|new democracy]], [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democracy]] and the [[primary stage of socialism]].{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This is also why amendments to constitutions are not enough and major societal changes need a constitution which corresponds with the reality of the new class structure.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}}\n\nWith [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|repudiation of Stalin's practices]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]'s repudiation of certain [[Maoist]] policies, Marxist\u2013Leninist legal theories began to emphasise \"the formal, formerly neglected constitutional order\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xiii}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], not long after [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] 's death, noted that \"[d]emocracy has to be institutionalised and written into law, so as to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes or whenever the leaders change their views. [...] The trouble now is that our legal system is incomplete. [...] Very often what leaders say is taken as law and anyone who disagrees is called a lawbreaker\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=112}} In 1986, Li Buyan wrote that \"the policies of the Party usually are regulations and calls which to a certain extent are only principles. The law is different; it is rigorously standardised. It explicitly and concretely stipulates what the people should, can or cannot do\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=114}} These legal developments have been echoed in later years in Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. This has led to the development of the communist concept of socialist rule of law which runs parallel to and is disctint to the [[Rule of law|liberal term]] of the same name.{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=118}} In the last years, this emphasization on the constitution as both a legal document and a paper which documents society's development has been noted by [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], who stated in 2013 that \"[n]o organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the Constitution and law\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/03/chinas-constitution-debate-hits-a-sensitive-nerve/|title=China's constitution debate hits a sensitive nerve|last1=Wan|first1=William|last2=Qi|first2=Li|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Constitutional supervision ====\nAfter [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, several communist states have experimented with some sort of constitutional supervision.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} These organs were designed to safeguard the supreme power of the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was the first to experiment with constitutional supervision when it established a Constitutional Committee in 1965.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was elected by the legislature and leading jurists sat in the committee, but it was only empowered to advice the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Keith Hand has commented that \"[i]t was not an effective institution in practice\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} \n\n[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] experimented with constitutional supervision in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Hungary established the Council of Constitutional Law which was elected by the legislature and consisted of several leading jurists.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was empowered to review the constitutionality and legality of statutes, administrative regulations and other normative documents; however, if the agency in question failed to heed its advice, it needed to petition the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} In 1989, the Soviets established the Constitutional Supervision Committee which \"was subordinate only to the USSR constitution\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} It was empowered \"to review the constitutionality and legality of a range of state acts of the USSR and its republics. Its jurisdiction included laws [passed by the legislature], decrees of the Supreme Soviet\u2019s Presidium, union republic constitutions and laws, some central administrative decrees, Supreme Court explanations, and other central normative documents\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} If the committee deemed the legislature to have breached legality, the legislature was obliged to discuss the issue, but it could reject it if more than two-thirds voted against the findings of the Constitutional Supervision Committee.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} While it was constitutionally powerful, it lacked enforcement powers, it was often ignored and it failed to defend the constitution during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=5}} \n\nThe [[Generations of Chinese leadership|Chinese leadership]] has argued against establishing a constitutional supervisory committee due to their association with failed communist states of Europe.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=15}} None of the surviving communist states (China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam) have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of anykind outside the existing framework.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=16}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\n{{main|Socialist law}}\nAll communist states have been established in countries with a [[civil law system]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} The countries of Eastern Europe had formally been governed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]]\u2014all of whom had civil law legal system.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Cuba had a civil law system imposed on them by Spain while China introduced civil law to overlay with Confucian elements and Vietnam used French law.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, there has been a scholarly debate on whether [[socialist law]] is a separate legal system or is a part of the civil law tradition.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Legal scholar Ren\u00e8 David wrote that the socialist legal system \"possesses, in relation to our French law, particular features that give it a complete originality, to the extent that it is no longer possible to connect it, like the former Russian law, to the system of [[Roman law]]\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=782}} Similarly, Christoper Osakwe concludes that socialist law is \"an autonomous legal system to be essentially distinguished from the other contemporary families of law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}} Proponents of socialist law as a separate legal system, have identified the following features:{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is to disappear with the [[withering away of the state]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The rule of the Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is subordinate and reflect changes to the economic order (the absorption of [[private law]] by [[public law]]).{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law has a religious character.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n# The socialist law is [[prerogative]] rather than [[normative]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n\nLegal officials argue differently for their case than Westerners.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} For instance, \"[t]he predominant view among Soviet jurists in the 1920s was that Soviet law of that period was Western-style law appropriate for a Soviet economy that remained capitalist to a significant degree\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} This changed with the introduction of the [[planned economy]] and the term socialist law was conceived to reflect this in the 1930s.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} Hungarian legal theorist Imre Szab\u00f3 acknowledged similarities between socialist law and civil law, but he noted that \"four basic types of law may be distinguished: the laws of the slave, feudal, capitalist and socialist societies\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|pp=798\u201399}} Using the Marxst theory of [[historical materialism]], Szab\u00f3 argues that socialist law cannot belong to the same law family since the material structure is different  from the capitalist countries as their superstructure (state) has to reflect these differences.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} In other words, law is a tool by the [[ruling class]] to govern.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} As Ren\u00e8 David notes, socialist jurists \"isolate their law, to put into another category, a reprobate category, the Romanist laws and the common law, is the fact that they reason less as jurists and more as philosophers and Marxists; it is in taking a not strictly legal viewpoint that they affirm the originality of their socialist law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=797}} However, some socialist legal theorists such as Romanian jurist Victor Zlatescu differentiated between type of law and family of law. According to Zlatescu, \"[t]he distinction between the law of the socialist countries and the law of the capitalist countries is not of the same nature as the difference between Roman-German law and the common law, for example. Socialist law is not a third family among the others, as appears in certain writings of Western comparatists\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}} In other words, socialist law is civil law, but it is a different type of law for a different type of society.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}}\n\nYugoslav jurist Borislav Blagojevic noted that a \"great number of legal institutions and legal relations remain the same in socialist law\", further stating that it is \"necessary and justified\" to put them to use if they are \"in conformity with the corresponding interests of the ruling class in the state in question\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=802}} Importantly, socialist law has retained civil law institutions, methodology and organization.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}} This can be discerned by the fact that [[East Germany]] retained the [[1896 German civil code]] until 1976 while [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] used existing Austrian, French, German and Russian civil codes until its adoption of its own civil code in 1964.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=801}} Scholar John Quigley wrote that \"[s]ocialist law retains the inquisitorial style of trial, law-creation predominantly by legislatures rather than courts, and a significant role for legal scholarship in construing codes\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}}\n\n== List of communist states ==\n=== Current communist states ===\nThe following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined.
