This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg.

At the time there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations.

This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg. Her description and illustration of this were enough to convince [[Charles Darwin]] to revise a later edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-link=Jemima Blackburn|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|date=2006}}</ref>\n\nJenner's interest in Zoology played a large role in his first experiment with inoculation.  Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission.  At the time there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations.

The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]) and presented several papers there.  In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.<ref>John Baron, Life of Edward Jenner (London, 1837), vol. 2, pp. 122\u20135.</ref>\n\nReturning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to [[King George IV]], and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace.<ref name=\"Reward\"/> He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his \"Observations on the Migration of Birds\" to the Royal Society.<ref name=\"Reward\"/>\n\n== Death ==\nJenner was found in a state of [[apoplexy]] on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed.

Both these perspectives are useful: while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole, when actually represented as a data structure it is usually represented and worked with separately by node (rather than as a set of nodes and an [[adjacency list]] of edges between nodes, as one may represent a [[#Digraphs|digraph]], for instance). For example, looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about \"the parent node\" of a given node, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of its children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any).\n\n==Preliminary definition==\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:Directed graph, disjoint.svg|thumb|x100px|{{color|#800000|Not a tree}}: two non-[[Connectivity (graph theory)#Definitions of components, cuts and connectivity|connected]] parts, A\u2192B and C\u2192D\u2192E.

The structure is subject to the condition that every non-empty [[subalgebra]] must have the same [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]. That is, there must be a unique \"root\" node {{mvar|r}}, such that {{math|''parent''(''r'') {{=}} ''r''}} and for every node {{mvar|x}}, some iterative application {{math|''parent''(''parent''(...''parent''(''x'')...))}} equals {{mvar|r}}.\n\nThere are several equivalent definitions.\nAs the closest alternative, one can define unordered trees as [[Partial algebra |''partial'' algebras]] \n{{math|(''X'',&nbsp;''parent'')}}\nwhich are obtained from the total algebras described above by letting {{math|''parent''(''r'')}} be undefined.\nThat is, the root {{mvar|r}} is the only node on which the {{math|''parent''}} function is not defined and for every node \n{{mvar|x}}, the root is [[Reachability | reachable]] from {{mvar|x}} in the [[directed graph]] {{math|(''X'',&nbsp;''parent'')}}.\nThis definition is in fact coincident with that of an [[Arborescence (graph theory) | anti-arborescence]].\nThe [[TAoCP]] book uses the term ''oriented tree''.<ref name=\"TAoCP_oriented_trees\">\n[[Donald Knuth]].

Moreover, dedicated terminology can be provided for generalizations of unordered trees that correspond to distinguished subsets of the listed conditions: \n(3) &ndash; [[Directed_pseudoforest#Directed_pseudoforests|directed pseudoforest]],\n(4) &ndash; [[directed acyclic graph]] {{efn|\nApart from the finiteness condition.}},\n(3,4) &ndash; <q>unordered forest</q>,\n(1,2,3) &ndash; [[Pseudotree|directed pseudotree]].\n\nAnother equivalent definition of an unordered tree is that of a [[Tree (set theory)|set-theoretic tree]] that is singly-rooted and whose height is at most [[Ordinal_number#Ordinals_extend_the_natural_numbers|\u03c9]] (a <q>finite-ish</q> tree<ref name=\"Unger2012\">\n{{cite journal | title=Trees in Set Theory\n  | first=Spencer\n  | last=Unger\n  | url=http://www.math.cmu.edu/~sunger/TreesTalk.pdf#page=2\n  | year=2012}}\n</ref>). That is, the algebraic structures {{math|(''X'', ''parent'')}} are equivalent to [[Partially ordered set|partial orders]] <math>(X, \\le)</math> that have a [[Greatest_and_least_elements|top element]] {{mvar|r}}  and whose every principal [[Upper set|upset]] (aka [[principal filter]]) is a finite [[Total_order#Chains|chain]]. \nTo be precise, we should speak about an [[Inverse order | inverse]] set-theoretic tree since the set-theoretic definition usually employs opposite ordering.  \nThe correspondence between {{math|(''X'',&nbsp;''parent'')}} and {{math|(''X'',&nbsp;&le;)}} is established via reflexive [[transitive closure]] / [[Transitive reduction | reduction]], with the reduction resulting in the \"partial\" version without the root cycle.\n\nThe definition of [[Tree_(descriptive_set_theory) | trees in descriptive set theory]] (DST) utilizes the \nrepresentation of partial orders {{math|(''X'', &ge;)}} as [[Substring#Prefix | prefix]] orders between finite sequences. In turns out that up to [[Order isomorphism | isomorphism]], there is a one-to-one correspondence between the (inverse of) DST trees and the tree structures defined so far.\n\nWe can refer to the four equivalent characterizations as to \n''tree as an algebra'',\n''tree as a partial algebra'',\n''tree as a partial order'', and\n''tree as a prefix order''.\nThere is also a fifth equivalent definition &ndash; that of a \n[[Tree_(graph_theory)#Rooted_tree | graph-theoretic rooted tree]] which is just a connected acyclic \n[[Rooted_graph | rooted]] [[Graph theory | graph]].\n\n<hr>\n\nThe expression of trees as (partial) algebras\n<!-- {{efn| also called [[Functional graph | functional graphs]] }} --> \n{{math|(''X'',&nbsp;''parent'')}} follows directly the implementation of tree structures using ''parent pointers''. Typically, the partial version is used in which the root node has no parent defined. However, in some implementations or models even the {{math|''parent''(''r'') {{=}} ''r''}} circularity is established. Notable examples: \n<ul>\n<li>\nThe Linux [[Virtual File System| VFS]]  where \"The root dentry has a d_parent that points to itself\" <ref>{{cite web | author=Bruce Fields | url=http://www.fieldses.org/~bfields/kernel/vfs.txt | title=Notes on the Linux kernel}}</ref>.\n<li>\nThe concept of an ''instantiation tree''\n<ref>{{cite journal | publisher=North-Holland | author=Pierre Cointe | title=Metaclasses are First Class: the ObjVlisp Model | journal=Proceeding OOPSLA '87 Conference Proceedings on Object-oriented Programming Systems, Languages and Applications | year=1987}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book | publisher=Springer | year=1995 | author=Wolfgang Klas, Michael Schrefl | title=Metaclasses and Their Application: Data Model Tailoring and Database Integration}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atalon.cz/om/what-is-a-metaclass/ | title=What Is a Metaclass? }}</ref>\nfrom [[object-oriented programming]].

This allows for the description of infinite structures supported by some implementations via [[lazy evaluation]]. A notable example is the [[infinite regress]] of [[Eigenclass model | eigenclasses]] from the [[Ruby (programming language) | Ruby]] object model.<ref>\n{{cite web | url=http://www.atalon.cz/rb-om/ruby-object-model/ | title=The Ruby Object Model: Data structure in detail }}</ref>\nIn this model, the tree established via <code>superclass</code> links between non-terminal objects is infinite and has an infinite branch (a single infinite branch of \"helix\" objects &ndash; see the [[Metaclass#In_Ruby | diagram]]).\n\n==== Sibling sets ====\n\nIn every unordered tree {{math|(''X'', ''parent'')}} there is a distinguished [[Partition of a set | partition]] of the set {{mvar|X}} of nodes into <em>sibling sets</em>. \nTwo non-root nodes {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} belong to the same sibling set if \n<span class=\"texhtml\">''parent''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''parent''(''y'')</span>.\nThe root node {{mvar|r}} forms the [[Singleton set | singleton]] sibling set {{math|{''r''}}}. {{efn|\nAlternatively, a \"partial\" version can be employed by excluding <math>{r}</math>.}}\nA tree is said to be <em>locally finite</em> or <em>finitely branching</em> if each of its sibling sets is finite.\n\nEach pair of distinct siblings is [[Comparability|incomparable]] in <span class=\"texhtml\">&le;</span>.\nThis is why the word <em>unordered</em> is used in the definition.\nSuch a terminology might become misleading when all sibling sets are singletons, i.e. when the set {{mvar|X}} of all nodes is [[Total order | totally ordered]] (and thus [[Well-order | well-ordered]]) by <span class=\"texhtml\">&le;</span>. \nIn such a case we might speak about a <em>singly-branching tree</em> instead.\n\n==== Using set inclusion ====\n\nAs with every partially ordered set, tree structures <span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;)</span> can be represented by [[inclusion order]] &ndash; by  [[set systems]]s in which <span class=\"texhtml\">&le;</span> is coincident with <span class=\"texhtml\">&sube;</span>, the induced [[Set inclusion | inclusion]] order.\nConsider a structure <span class=\"texhtml\">(''U'', \u2131)</span> such that {{mvar|U}} is a non-empty set, and <span class=\"texhtml\">\u2131</span> is a set of subsets of {{mvar|U}} such that the following are satisfied (by [[Nested_set#Formal_definition|Nested Set Collection]] definition):\n<!-- \u2119({{mvar|S}}) -->\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class=\"texhtml\">&empty;</span> <span class=\"texhtml\">&notin; \u2131</span>.\n&nbsp; (That is, <span class=\"texhtml\">(''U'', \u2131)</span> is a [[hypergraph]].)\n<li>\n<span class=\"texhtml\">''U'' &isin; \u2131</span>.\n<li>\nFor every {{mvar|X}}, {{mvar|Y}} from <span class=\"texhtml\">\u2131</span>, &nbsp;\n<span class=\"texhtml\">''X'' &cap; ''Y'' &isin; {&empty;, ''X'', ''Y''}</span>.\n&nbsp; (That is, <span class=\"texhtml\">\u2131</span> is a <em>laminar</em> family.<ref>{{cite book\n| author=B.

Arrows that cause cycles are displayed in blue.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\" style=\"font-size:90%\">\nr = {\"a\":{\"a\":5,\"b\":5},\"c\":{\"a\":{\"w\":5},\"c\":{}},\"d\":{\"w\":1.3}}\n\nr[\"b\"]           = r[\"a\"]; r[\"c\"][\"b\"] = r[\"c\"][\"a\"]\nr[\"c\"][\"a\"][\"p\"] = r[\"c\"]; r[\"d\"][\"e\"] = r[\"d\"][\"self\"] = r[\"d\"]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the Linux VFS, the name function {{mvar|&sigma;}} is represented by the <code>d_name</code> field in the dentry data structure.<ref name=\"Bovet2005\"/>\nThe {{math|\u2130{{sub|0}}}} structure above demonstrates a correspondence between JSON-representable structures and hard-link structures of file systems.\nIn both cases, there is a fixed set of built-in types of <q>nodes</q> of which one type is a container type, except that in JSON, there are in fact two such [[JSON#Data_types_and_syntax|types]]\n&ndash; Object and Array. If the latter one is ignored (as well as the distinction between individual primitive data types) then the provided abstractions of file-systems and JSON data are the same\n&ndash;\nboth are arrow trees equipped with naming {{mvar|&sigma;}} and a distinction of container nodes.\n\n===== Pathnames =====\n\nThe naming function {{mvar|&sigma;}} of a nested dictionary {{math|\u2130}} naturally extends from arrows to arrow paths.\nEach sequence {{math|''p'' {{=}} [''a''{{sub|1}},&nbsp;&hellip;,&nbsp;''a''{{sub|n}}] }} of consecutive arrows is implicitly assigned a <em>pathname</em> (cf. [[Pathname]])\n&ndash; the sequence\n{{math|''&sigma;''(''p'') {{=}} [''&sigma;''(''a''{{sub|1}}),&nbsp;&hellip;,&nbsp;''&sigma;''(''a''{{sub|n}})] }} of arrow names.{{efn|\nHere we assume that the root arrow {{math|''a''{{sub|r}}}} is not in {{mvar|p}}.\n}}\nLocal uniqueness carries over to arrow paths: different sibling paths have different pathnames.\nIn particular, the root-originating arrow paths are in one-to-one correspondence with their pathnames.\nThis correspondence provides a <q>symbolic</q> representation of the unfolding of {{math|\u2130}} via pathnames\n&ndash;\nthe nodes in {{math|\u2130}} are globally identified via a tree of pathnames.\n\n=== Ordered tree ===\n\nThe structures introduced in the previous subsection form just the core \"hierarchical\"  part of tree data structures\nthat appear in computing. In most cases, there is also an additional \"horizontal\" ordering between siblings. In [[search tree]]s the order is commonly established by the \"key\" or value associated with each sibling, but in many trees that is not the case. For example, XML documents, lists within JSON files, and many other structures have order that does not depend on the values in the nodes, but is itself data {{--}} sorting the paragraphs of a novel alphabetically would lose information.{{Dubious|disputed-ordered-tree-1|date=April 2019}} \n\nThe correspondent [[Expansion (model theory) | expansion]] of the previously described tree structures <span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;)</span> can be defined by endowing each sibling set with a linear order as follows.<ref name=\"Hidders2005\">\n{{cite journal | title=Optimizing sorting and duplicate elimination in XQuery path expressions\n  | author1=Jan Hidders\n  | author2=Philippe Michiels\n  | author3=Roel Vercammen\n  | url=http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/bibrem/pubs/hidders.12.pdf#page=5\n  | year=2005}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Dau2007\">\n{{cite journal | title=A formalism for navigating and editing XML document structure\n  | author1=Frithjof Dau\n  | author2=Mark Sifer\n  | url=http://dr-dau.org/Papers/sifer_dau_paper_final_version.pdf#page=10\n  | journal=International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems\n  | publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg\n  | year=2007}}\n</ref>\nAn alternative definition according to Kuboyama<ref name=\"Kuboyama2007\"/> is presented in the next subsection.\n\nAn <em>ordered tree</em> is a structure \n<span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', \n&le;<sub>V</sub>,\n&le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> \nwhere \n{{mvar|X}} is a non-empty set of nodes\nand\n<span class=\"texhtml\">&le;<sub>V</sub></span> \nand\n<span class=\"texhtml\">&le;<sub>S</sub></span> \nare relations on {{mvar|X}} \ncalled <em><u>v</u>ertical</em> (or also <em>hierarchical</em><ref name=\"Kuboyama2007\"/>) order\nand \n<em><u>s</u>ibling</em> order, respectively.\nThe structure is subject to the following conditions:\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>V</sub>)</span>\nis a partial order that is an unordered tree as defined in the previous subsection. \n<li>\n<span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> \nis a partial order. \n<li>\nDistinct nodes are comparable in <span class=\"texhtml\">&lt;<sub>S</sub></span> if and only if they are siblings: \n\n<span class=\"texhtml\">(&lt;<sub>S</sub>)&nbsp;<span>&cup;</span>&nbsp;(&gt;<sub>S</sub>)&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;((<span>\u227a</span><sub>V</sub>)&nbsp;<span>\u25cb</span>&nbsp;(<span>\u227b</span><sub>V</sub>))&nbsp;<span>\u2216</span>&nbsp;[[Identity_function|<span>id</span><sub>''X''</sub>]]</span>.\n</ol>\n(The following condition can be omitted in the case of finite trees.)\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\nEvery node has only finitely many preceding siblings, i.e. every principal ideal of <span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> is finite. \n\n</ol>\n\nConditions (2) and (3) say that <span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span>\nis a component-wise linear order, each component being a sibling set. \nCondition (4) asserts that if a sibling set {{mvar|S}} is infinite then <span class=\"texhtml\">(''S'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> is isomorphic to \n<span class=\"texhtml\">(<span>\u2115</span>, &le;)</span>, the usual ordering of natural numbers.\n\nGiven this, there are three (another) distinguished partial orders which are uniquely given by the following prescriptions:\n\n::{| cellpadding=3 style=\"border:0\"\n| <span class=\"texhtml\">(&lt;<sub>H</sub>)</span> \n| <span class=\"texhtml\">&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span>\n| <span class=\"texhtml\">(&le;<sub>V</sub>)&nbsp;<span \nstyle=\"font-style:normal\">\u25cb</span>&nbsp;(&lt;<sub>S</sub>)&nbsp;<span>\u25cb</span>&nbsp;(&ge;<sub>V</sub>)</span>\n| &nbsp;

To allow finite trees, one must either allow the list of children to be empty (in which case trees can be required to be non-empty, an \"empty tree\" instead being represented by a forest of zero trees), or allow trees to be empty, in which case the list of children can be of fixed size ([[branching factor]], especially 2 or \"binary\"), if desired.\n\nAs a data structure, a linked tree is a group of [[Node (computer science)|nodes]], where each node has a value and a list of [[Reference (computer science)|references]] to other nodes (its children).  There is also the requirement that no two \"downward\" references point to the same node. In practice, nodes in a tree commonly include other data as well, such as next/previous references, references to their parent nodes, or nearly anything.\n\nDue to the use of {{math|references}} to trees in the linked tree data structure, trees are often discussed implicitly assuming that they are being represented by references to the root node, as this is often how they are actually implemented. For example, rather than an empty tree, one may have a null reference: a tree is always non-empty, but a reference to a tree may be null.\n\n===Recursive===\nRecursively, as a data type a tree is defined as a value (of some data type, possibly empty), together with a list of trees (possibly an empty list), the subtrees of its children; symbolically:\n t: v <nowiki>[t[1], ..., t[k]]</nowiki>\n(A tree {{mvar|t}} consists of a value {{mvar|v}} and a list of other trees.)\n\nMore elegantly, via [[mutual recursion]], of which a tree is one of the most basic examples, a tree can be defined in terms of forest (a list of trees), where a tree consists of a value and a forest (the subtrees of its children):\n f: <nowiki>[t[1], ..., t[k]]</nowiki>\n t: v f\n\nNote that this definition is in terms of values, and is appropriate in [[functional language]]s (it assumes [[referential transparency]]); different trees have no connections, as they are simply lists of values.\n\nAs a data structure, a tree is defined as a node (the root), which itself consists of a value (of some data type, possibly empty), together with a list of references to other nodes (list possibly empty, references possibly null); symbolically:\n n: v <nowiki>[&amp;n[1], ..., &amp;n[k]]</nowiki>\n(A node {{mvar|n}} consists of a value {{mvar|v}} and a list of references to other nodes.)\n\nThis data structure defines a directed graph,{{efn|Properly, a rooted, ordered directed graph.}} and for it to be a tree one must add a condition on its global structure (its topology), namely that at most one reference can point to any given node (a node has at most a single parent), and no node in the tree point to the root. In fact, every node (other than the root) must have exactly one parent, and the root must have no parents.\n\nIndeed, given a list of nodes, and for each node a list of references to its children, one cannot tell if this structure is a tree or not without analyzing its global structure and that it is in fact topologically a tree, as defined below.\n\n===Type theory===\nAs an [[Abstract data type|ADT]], the abstract tree type {{mvar|T}} with values of some type {{mvar|E}} is defined, using the  abstract forest type {{mvar|F}} (list of trees), by the functions:\n:value: {{mvar|T}} \u2192 {{mvar|E}}\n:children: {{mvar|T}} \u2192 {{mvar|F}}\n:nil: () \u2192 {{mvar|F}}\n:node: {{mvar|E}} \u00d7 {{mvar|F}} \u2192 {{mvar|T}}\nwith the axioms:\n:value(node({{mvar|e}}, {{mvar|f}})) = {{mvar|e}}\n:children(node({{mvar|e}}, {{mvar|f}})) = {{mvar|f}}\nIn terms of [[type theory]], a tree is an [[Recursive data type|inductive type]] defined by the constructors {{math|nil}} (empty forest) and {{math|node}} (tree with root node with given value and children).\n\n===Mathematical===\nViewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an [[ordered tree]], generally with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be non-empty):\n* A [[rooted tree]] with the \"away from root\" direction (a more narrow term is an \"[[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescence]]\"), meaning:\n** A [[directed graph]],\n** whose underlying [[undirected graph]] is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] (any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path),\n** with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),\n** which determines the direction on the edges (arrows point away from the root; given an edge, the node that the edge points from is called the {{math|parent}} and the node that the edge points to is called the {{math|child}}),\ntogether with:\n* an ordering on the child nodes of a given node, and\n* a value (of some data type) at each node.\nOften trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) [[branching factor]] ([[outdegree]]), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty, hence ''at most'' two ''non-empty'' child nodes), hence a \"binary tree\".\n\nAllowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are allowed the above definition instead becomes \"an empty tree or a rooted tree such that ...\". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include fork operation.\n\n==Terminology==\nA '''[[node (computer science)|node]]''' is a structure which may contain a value or condition, or represent a separate data structure (which could be a tree of its own). Each node in a tree has zero or more '''child nodes''', which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are drawn growing downwards). A node that has a child is called the child's '''parent node''' (or ''ancestor node'', or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]). A node has at most one parent.\n\nAn '''internal node''' (also known as an '''inner node''', '''inode''' for short, or '''branch node''') is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an '''external node''' (also known as an '''outer node''', '''leaf node''', or '''terminal node''') is any node that does not have child nodes.\n\nThe topmost node in a tree is called the '''root node'''. Depending on definition, a tree may be required to have a root node (in which case all trees are non-empty), or may be allowed to be empty, in which case it does not necessarily have a root node. Being the topmost node, the root node will not have a parent. It is the node at which algorithms on the tree begin, since as a data structure, one can only pass from parents to children. Note that some algorithms (such as post-order depth-first search) begin at the root, but first visit leaf nodes (access the value of leaf nodes), only visit the root last (i.e., they first access the children of the root, but only access the value of the root last). All other nodes can be reached from it by following '''edges''' or '''links'''. (In the formal definition, each such path is also unique.) In diagrams, the root node is conventionally drawn at the top. In some trees, such as [[heap (data structure)|heaps]], the root node has special properties. Every node in a tree can be seen as the root node of the subtree rooted at that node.\n\nThe '''height''' of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The '''depth''' of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its ''root path''). This is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, [[AVL Trees]] in particular. The root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such are allowed) has height \u22121.\n\nA '''subtree''' of a tree {{mvar|T}} is a tree consisting of a node in {{mvar|T}} and all of its descendants in {{mvar|T}}.{{efn|This is different from the formal definition of subtree used in graph theory, which is a subgraph that forms a tree \u2013 it need not include all descendants. For example, the root node by itself is a subtree in the graph theory sense, but not in the data structure sense (unless there are no descendants).}}<ref>{{MathWorld|id=Subtree|title=Subtree}}</ref> Nodes thus correspond to subtrees (each node corresponds to the subtree of itself and all its descendants) \u2013 the subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree, and each node is the root node of the subtree it determines; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a '''proper subtree''' (by analogy to a [[proper subset]]).\n\n==Drawing trees==\nTrees are often drawn in the plane. Ordered trees can be represented essentially uniquely in the plane, and are hence called ''plane trees,'' as follows: if one fixes a conventional order (say, counterclockwise), and arranges the child nodes in that order (first incoming parent edge, then first child edge, etc.), this yields an embedding of the tree in the plane, unique up to [[ambient isotopy]]. Conversely, such an embedding determines an ordering of the child nodes.\n\nIf one places the root at the top (parents above children, as in a [[family tree]]) and places all nodes that are a given distance from the root (in terms of number of edges: the \"level\" of a tree) on a given horizontal line, one obtains a standard drawing of the tree. Given a binary tree, the first child is on the left (the \"left node\"), and the second child is on the right (the \"right node\").\n\n==Representations==\nThere are many different ways to represent trees; common representations represent the nodes as [[Dynamic memory allocation|dynamically allocated]] records with pointers to their children, their parents, or both, or as items in an [[Array data structure|array]], with relationships between them determined by their positions in the array (e.g., [[binary heap]]).\n\nIndeed, a binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists (a list where the values are lists): the head of a list (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree). This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp [[S-expression]]s, where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.\n\nIn general a node in a tree will not have pointers to its parents, but this information can be included (expanding the data structure to also include a pointer to the parent) or stored separately. Alternatively, upward links can be included in the child node data, as in a [[threaded binary tree]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n===Digraphs===\nIf edges (to child nodes) are thought of as references, then a tree is a special case of a digraph, and the tree data structure can be generalized to represent [[directed graph]]s by removing the constraints that a node may have at most one parent, and that no cycles are allowed. Edges are still abstractly considered as pairs of nodes, however, the terms {{math|parent}} and {{math|child}} are usually replaced by different terminology (for example, {{math|source}} and {{math|target}}). Different [[graph (data structure)#Representations|implementation strategies]] exist: a digraph can be represented by the same local data structure as a tree (node with value and list of children), assuming that \"list of children\" is a list of references, or globally by such structures as [[adjacency list]]s.\n\nIn [[graph theory]], a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] is a connected acyclic [[Graph (data structure)|graph]]; unless stated otherwise, in graph theory trees and graphs are assumed undirected. There is no one-to-one correspondence between such trees and trees as data structure. We can take an arbitrary undirected tree, arbitrarily pick one of its [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] as the {{math|root}}, make all its edges directed by making them point away from the root node \u2013 producing an [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescence]] \u2013 and assign an order to all the nodes. The result corresponds to a tree data structure. Picking a different root or different ordering produces a different one.\n\nGiven a node in a tree, its children define an ordered forest (the union of subtrees given by all the children, or equivalently taking the subtree given by the node itself and erasing the root). Just as subtrees are natural for recursion (as in a depth-first search), forests are natural for [[corecursion]] (as in a breadth-first search).\n\nVia [[mutual recursion]], a forest can be defined as a list of trees (represented by root nodes), where a node (of a tree) consists of a value and a forest (its children):\n f: <nowiki>[n[1], ..., n[k]]</nowiki>\n n: v f\n\n==Traversal methods==\n{{Main article|Tree traversal}}\nStepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between parents and children, is called '''walking the tree''', and the action is a '{{math|walk}}' of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before its children is called a '''pre-order''' walk; a walk in which the children are traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a '''post-order''' walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an '''in-order''' traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a [[binary tree]].)\nA '''level-order''' walk effectively performs a [[breadth-first search]] over the entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until all nodes in the tree have been traversed.\n\n==Common operations==\n* Enumerating all the items\n* Enumerating a section of a tree\n* Searching for an item\n* Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree\n* Deleting an item\n* [[Pruning (algorithm)|Pruning]]: Removing a whole section of a tree\n* [[Grafting (algorithm)|Grafting]]: Adding a whole section to a tree\n* Finding the root for any node\n* Finding the [[lowest common ancestor]] of two nodes\n\n==Common uses==\n* Representing [[hierarchical]] data such as [[Abstract syntax tree|syntax tree]]s\n* Storing data in a way that makes it efficiently [[search algorithm|searchable]] (see [[binary search tree]] and [[tree traversal]])\n* Representing [[sorting algorithm|sorted lists]] of data\n* As a workflow for [[Digital compositing|compositing]] digital images for [[visual effects]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n* Storing [[Barnes-Hut]] trees used to simulate galaxies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tree structure]]\n* [[Tree (graph theory)]]\n* [[Tree (set theory)]]\n* [[Cardinal tree]] and [[Ordinal tree]]\n* [[Hierarchy (mathematics)]]\n* [[Dialog tree]]\n* [[Single inheritance]]\n* [[Generative grammar]]\n* [[Hierarchical clustering]]\n* [[Binary space partition tree]]\n* [[Recursion]]\n* [[Fenwick tree]]\n\n===Other trees===\n* [[Trie]]\n* [[Day\u2013Stout\u2013Warren algorithm]]\n* [[Enfilade (Xanadu)|Enfilade]]\n* [[Left child-right sibling binary tree]]\n* [[Hierarchical temporal memory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* [[Donald Knuth]].

Both these perspectives are useful: while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole, when actually represented as a data structure it is usually represented and worked with separately by node (rather than as a set of nodes and an [[adjacency list]] of edges between nodes, as one may represent a [[#Digraphs|digraph]], for instance). For example, looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about \"the parent node\" of a given node, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of its children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any).\n\n==Preliminary definition==\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:Directed graph, disjoint.svg|thumb|x100px|{{color|#800000|Not a tree}}: two non-[[Connectivity (graph theory)#Definitions of components, cuts and connectivity|connected]] parts, A\u2192B and C\u2192D\u2192E.

To obtain naming capabilities, arrows are to be equipped with <em>names</em> as [[identifier]]s.\nA name must be locally unique &ndash; within each sibling set of arrows{{efn|\nI.e. arrows that have the same source node.\n}} there can be at most one arrow labelled by a given name. \n\n<div style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 .5em 1em\">\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid rgb(0,0,0)\"\n|-\n| <code style=\"text-decoration: underline\">source</code>\n| <code style=\"text-decoration: underline\">name</code> \n| <code>target</code>\n|-\n! style=\"border-left: 1px dotted black\"| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp; \n| &nbsp; \n|- \n! style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:100\"| {{math|''s''(''a'')}} \n! style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:100\"| {{mvar|''&sigma;''(''a'')}} \n! style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:100\"| {{mvar|''t''(''a'')}}\n|}\n</div>\nThis can be formalized as a structure\n{{math| \u2130&nbsp;{{=}} (''X'',&nbsp;''\u03a3'',&nbsp;''A'',&nbsp;''s'',&nbsp;''&sigma;'',&nbsp;''t'')}} where \n{{mvar|X}} is a set of <em>nodes</em>, \n{{mvar|\u03a3}} is a set of <em>names</em>, \n{{mvar|A}} is a set of <em>arrows</em>, \n{{mvar|s}} is a partial function from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|X}}, \n{{mvar|&sigma;}} is a partial function from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|\u03a3}}, and\n{{mvar|t}} is a total function from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|X}}.\nFor an arrow {{mvar|a}}, constituents of the triple \n{{math|(''s''(''a''),&nbsp;''&sigma;''(''a''),&nbsp;''t''(''a''))}} are respectively {{mvar|a}}'s\n<em>source</em>, <em>name</em> and <em>target</em>.\nThe structure is subject to the following conditions.\n<ol>\n<li>\nThe reduct {{math|(''X'',&nbsp;''A'',&nbsp;''s'',&nbsp;''t'')}} is an \n[[#apq|accessible pointed quiver]] (apq) as defined previously.\n<li>\nThe name function {{mvar|&sigma;}} is undefined just for the source-less root arrow.\n<li>\nThe name function {{mvar|&sigma;}} is injective in the restriction to every sibling set of arrows, i.e. for every non-root arrows {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, \nif {{math|''s''(''a'')&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''s''(''b'')}} and\n{{math|''&sigma;''(''a'')&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''&sigma;''(''b'')}} then\n{{math|''a''&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''b''}}.\n</ol>  \n\nThis structure can be called a <em>nested dictionary</em> or <em>named apq</em>.\nIn computing, such structures are ubiquitous.\nThe table above shows that arrows can be considered <q>un-reified</q> as the set\n{{math|''A''' {{=}} {(''s''(''a''),&nbsp;''&sigma;''(''a''),&nbsp;''t''(''a'')) {{!}} ''a''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{''a''{{sub|r}}&zwj;}&zwj;}&zwj;}}\nof source-name-target triples.\nThis leads to a relational structure {{math|(''X'',&nbsp;''\u03a3'',&nbsp;''A''')}}\nwhich can be viewed as a\n[[relational database]] table.\nUnderlines in \n<code style=\"text-decoration: underline\">source</code> and\n<code style=\"text-decoration: underline\">name</code> \nindicate [[primary key]].\nThe structure can be rephrased as a\ndeterministic [[Labelled_transition_system#Formal_definition|labelled transition system]]:\n{{mvar|X}} is a set of <q>states</q>, {{mvar|\u03a3}} is a set of <q>labels</q>, {{mvar|A'}} is a set of <q>labelled transitions</q>.\n(Moreover, the root node {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''t''(''a''{{sub|r}})}} is an <q>initial state</q>, and the accessibility condition means that every state is reachable from the initial state.)\n\n<div style=\"float:right; width: 310px; margin: -0.5em 0 0 1em; padding: 0 0.2em .1em .5em; border:1px solid rgba(90,90,90,.2);\">\n[[File:Nested-dictionary-1.svg| frameless\n| Nested dictionary|\n| 310px\n]]\n<div style=\"font-style:italic; text-align: center;\">Nested dictionary</div>\n</div>\n\nThe diagram on the right shows a nested dictionary {{math|\u2130}}\nthat has the same underlying multidigraph as the example in the previous subsection.\nThe structure can be created by the code below. Like before, exactly the same code applies for JavaScript, Python and Ruby.\n\nFirst, a [[Substructure (mathematics)|substructure]], {{math|\u2130{{sub|0}}}}, is created\nby a single assignment of a [[Literal_(computer_programming)|literal]] <code>{...}</code> to <code>r</code>.\nThis structure, depicted by full lines, is an <q>[[#arrow-tree|arrow tree]]</q> (therefore, it is a [[Spanning_tree#In_directed_multigraphs|spanning tree]]).\nThe literal in turn appears to be a [[JSON]] serialization of {{math|\u2130{{sub|0}}}}.\n\nSubsequently, the remaining arrows are created by assignments of already existing nodes. Arrows that cause cycles are displayed in blue.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\" style=\"font-size:90%\">\nr = {\"a\":{\"a\":5,\"b\":5},\"c\":{\"a\":{\"w\":5},\"c\":{}},\"d\":{\"w\":1.3}}\n\nr[\"b\"]           = r[\"a\"]; r[\"c\"][\"b\"] = r[\"c\"][\"a\"]\nr[\"c\"][\"a\"][\"p\"] = r[\"c\"]; r[\"d\"][\"e\"] = r[\"d\"][\"self\"] = r[\"d\"]\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the Linux VFS, the name function {{mvar|&sigma;}} is represented by the <code>d_name</code> field in the dentry data structure.<ref name=\"Bovet2005\"/>\nThe {{math|\u2130{{sub|0}}}} structure above demonstrates a correspondence between JSON-representable structures and hard-link structures of file systems.\nIn both cases, there is a fixed set of built-in types of <q>nodes</q> of which one type is a container type, except that in JSON, there are in fact two such [[JSON#Data_types_and_syntax|types]]\n&ndash; Object and Array. If the latter one is ignored (as well as the distinction between individual primitive data types) then the provided abstractions of file-systems and JSON data are the same\n&ndash;\nboth are arrow trees equipped with naming {{mvar|&sigma;}} and a distinction of container nodes.\n\n===== Pathnames =====\n\nThe naming function {{mvar|&sigma;}} of a nested dictionary {{math|\u2130}} naturally extends from arrows to arrow paths.\nEach sequence {{math|''p'' {{=}} [''a''{{sub|1}},&nbsp;&hellip;,&nbsp;''a''{{sub|n}}] }} of consecutive arrows is implicitly assigned a <em>pathname</em> (cf. [[Pathname]])\n&ndash; the sequence\n{{math|''&sigma;''(''p'') {{=}} [''&sigma;''(''a''{{sub|1}}),&nbsp;&hellip;,&nbsp;''&sigma;''(''a''{{sub|n}})] }} of arrow names.{{efn|\nHere we assume that the root arrow {{math|''a''{{sub|r}}}} is not in {{mvar|p}}.\n}}\nLocal uniqueness carries over to arrow paths: different sibling paths have different pathnames.\nIn particular, the root-originating arrow paths are in one-to-one correspondence with their pathnames.\nThis correspondence provides a <q>symbolic</q> representation of the unfolding of {{math|\u2130}} via pathnames\n&ndash;\nthe nodes in {{math|\u2130}} are globally identified via a tree of pathnames.\n\n=== Ordered tree ===\n\nThe structures introduced in the previous subsection form just the core \"hierarchical\"  part of tree data structures\nthat appear in computing. In most cases, there is also an additional \"horizontal\" ordering between siblings. In [[search tree]]s the order is commonly established by the \"key\" or value associated with each sibling, but in many trees that is not the case. For example, XML documents, lists within JSON files, and many other structures have order that does not depend on the values in the nodes, but is itself data {{--}} sorting the paragraphs of a novel alphabetically would lose information.{{Dubious|disputed-ordered-tree-1|date=April 2019}} \n\nThe correspondent [[Expansion (model theory) | expansion]] of the previously described tree structures <span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;)</span> can be defined by endowing each sibling set with a linear order as follows.<ref name=\"Hidders2005\">\n{{cite journal | title=Optimizing sorting and duplicate elimination in XQuery path expressions\n  | author1=Jan Hidders\n  | author2=Philippe Michiels\n  | author3=Roel Vercammen\n  | url=http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/bibrem/pubs/hidders.12.pdf#page=5\n  | year=2005}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Dau2007\">\n{{cite journal | title=A formalism for navigating and editing XML document structure\n  | author1=Frithjof Dau\n  | author2=Mark Sifer\n  | url=http://dr-dau.org/Papers/sifer_dau_paper_final_version.pdf#page=10\n  | journal=International Workshop on Databases in Networked Information Systems\n  | publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg\n  | year=2007}}\n</ref>\nAn alternative definition according to Kuboyama<ref name=\"Kuboyama2007\"/> is presented in the next subsection.\n\nAn <em>ordered tree</em> is a structure \n<span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', \n&le;<sub>V</sub>,\n&le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> \nwhere \n{{mvar|X}} is a non-empty set of nodes\nand\n<span class=\"texhtml\">&le;<sub>V</sub></span> \nand\n<span class=\"texhtml\">&le;<sub>S</sub></span> \nare relations on {{mvar|X}} \ncalled <em><u>v</u>ertical</em> (or also <em>hierarchical</em><ref name=\"Kuboyama2007\"/>) order\nand \n<em><u>s</u>ibling</em> order, respectively.\nThe structure is subject to the following conditions:\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>V</sub>)</span>\nis a partial order that is an unordered tree as defined in the previous subsection. \n<li>\n<span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> \nis a partial order. \n<li>\nDistinct nodes are comparable in <span class=\"texhtml\">&lt;<sub>S</sub></span> if and only if they are siblings: \n\n<span class=\"texhtml\">(&lt;<sub>S</sub>)&nbsp;<span>&cup;</span>&nbsp;(&gt;<sub>S</sub>)&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;((<span>\u227a</span><sub>V</sub>)&nbsp;<span>\u25cb</span>&nbsp;(<span>\u227b</span><sub>V</sub>))&nbsp;<span>\u2216</span>&nbsp;[[Identity_function|<span>id</span><sub>''X''</sub>]]</span>.\n</ol>\n(The following condition can be omitted in the case of finite trees.)\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\nEvery node has only finitely many preceding siblings, i.e. every principal ideal of <span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> is finite. \n\n</ol>\n\nConditions (2) and (3) say that <span class=\"texhtml\">(''X'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span>\nis a component-wise linear order, each component being a sibling set. \nCondition (4) asserts that if a sibling set {{mvar|S}} is infinite then <span class=\"texhtml\">(''S'', &le;<sub>S</sub>)</span> is isomorphic to \n<span class=\"texhtml\">(<span>\u2115</span>, &le;)</span>, the usual ordering of natural numbers.\n\nGiven this, there are three (another) distinguished partial orders which are uniquely given by the following prescriptions:\n\n::{| cellpadding=3 style=\"border:0\"\n| <span class=\"texhtml\">(&lt;<sub>H</sub>)</span> \n| <span class=\"texhtml\">&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span>\n| <span class=\"texhtml\">(&le;<sub>V</sub>)&nbsp;<span \nstyle=\"font-style:normal\">\u25cb</span>&nbsp;(&lt;<sub>S</sub>)&nbsp;<span>\u25cb</span>&nbsp;(&ge;<sub>V</sub>)</span>\n| &nbsp;

To allow finite trees, one must either allow the list of children to be empty (in which case trees can be required to be non-empty, an \"empty tree\" instead being represented by a forest of zero trees), or allow trees to be empty, in which case the list of children can be of fixed size ([[branching factor]], especially 2 or \"binary\"), if desired.\n\nAs a data structure, a linked tree is a group of [[Node (computer science)|nodes]], where each node has a value and a list of [[Reference (computer science)|references]] to other nodes (its children).  There is also the requirement that no two \"downward\" references point to the same node. In practice, nodes in a tree commonly include other data as well, such as next/previous references, references to their parent nodes, or nearly anything.\n\nDue to the use of {{math|references}} to trees in the linked tree data structure, trees are often discussed implicitly assuming that they are being represented by references to the root node, as this is often how they are actually implemented. For example, rather than an empty tree, one may have a null reference: a tree is always non-empty, but a reference to a tree may be null.\n\n===Recursive===\nRecursively, as a data type a tree is defined as a value (of some data type, possibly empty), together with a list of trees (possibly an empty list), the subtrees of its children; symbolically:\n t: v <nowiki>[t[1], ..., t[k]]</nowiki>\n(A tree {{mvar|t}} consists of a value {{mvar|v}} and a list of other trees.)\n\nMore elegantly, via [[mutual recursion]], of which a tree is one of the most basic examples, a tree can be defined in terms of forest (a list of trees), where a tree consists of a value and a forest (the subtrees of its children):\n f: <nowiki>[t[1], ..., t[k]]</nowiki>\n t: v f\n\nNote that this definition is in terms of values, and is appropriate in [[functional language]]s (it assumes [[referential transparency]]); different trees have no connections, as they are simply lists of values.\n\nAs a data structure, a tree is defined as a node (the root), which itself consists of a value (of some data type, possibly empty), together with a list of references to other nodes (list possibly empty, references possibly null); symbolically:\n n: v <nowiki>[&amp;n[1], ..., &amp;n[k]]</nowiki>\n(A node {{mvar|n}} consists of a value {{mvar|v}} and a list of references to other nodes.)\n\nThis data structure defines a directed graph,{{efn|Properly, a rooted, ordered directed graph.}} and for it to be a tree one must add a condition on its global structure (its topology), namely that at most one reference can point to any given node (a node has at most a single parent), and no node in the tree point to the root. In fact, every node (other than the root) must have exactly one parent, and the root must have no parents.\n\nIndeed, given a list of nodes, and for each node a list of references to its children, one cannot tell if this structure is a tree or not without analyzing its global structure and that it is in fact topologically a tree, as defined below.\n\n===Type theory===\nAs an [[Abstract data type|ADT]], the abstract tree type {{mvar|T}} with values of some type {{mvar|E}} is defined, using the  abstract forest type {{mvar|F}} (list of trees), by the functions:\n:value: {{mvar|T}} \u2192 {{mvar|E}}\n:children: {{mvar|T}} \u2192 {{mvar|F}}\n:nil: () \u2192 {{mvar|F}}\n:node: {{mvar|E}} \u00d7 {{mvar|F}} \u2192 {{mvar|T}}\nwith the axioms:\n:value(node({{mvar|e}}, {{mvar|f}})) = {{mvar|e}}\n:children(node({{mvar|e}}, {{mvar|f}})) = {{mvar|f}}\nIn terms of [[type theory]], a tree is an [[Recursive data type|inductive type]] defined by the constructors {{math|nil}} (empty forest) and {{math|node}} (tree with root node with given value and children).\n\n===Mathematical===\nViewed as a whole, a tree data structure is an [[ordered tree]], generally with values attached to each node. Concretely, it is (if required to be non-empty):\n* A [[rooted tree]] with the \"away from root\" direction (a more narrow term is an \"[[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescence]]\"), meaning:\n** A [[directed graph]],\n** whose underlying [[undirected graph]] is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] (any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path),\n** with a distinguished root (one vertex is designated as the root),\n** which determines the direction on the edges (arrows point away from the root; given an edge, the node that the edge points from is called the {{math|parent}} and the node that the edge points to is called the {{math|child}}),\ntogether with:\n* an ordering on the child nodes of a given node, and\n* a value (of some data type) at each node.\nOften trees have a fixed (more properly, bounded) [[branching factor]] ([[outdegree]]), particularly always having two child nodes (possibly empty, hence ''at most'' two ''non-empty'' child nodes), hence a \"binary tree\".\n\nAllowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler, some more complicated: a rooted tree must be non-empty, hence if empty trees are allowed the above definition instead becomes \"an empty tree or a rooted tree such that ...\". On the other hand, empty trees simplify defining fixed branching factor: with empty trees allowed, a binary tree is a tree such that every node has exactly two children, each of which is a tree (possibly empty). The complete sets of operations on the tree must include fork operation.\n\n==Terminology==\nA '''[[node (computer science)|node]]''' is a structure which may contain a value or condition, or represent a separate data structure (which could be a tree of its own). Each node in a tree has zero or more '''child nodes''', which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are drawn growing downwards). A node that has a child is called the child's '''parent node''' (or ''ancestor node'', or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]). A node has at most one parent.\n\nAn '''internal node''' (also known as an '''inner node''', '''inode''' for short, or '''branch node''') is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an '''external node''' (also known as an '''outer node''', '''leaf node''', or '''terminal node''') is any node that does not have child nodes.\n\nThe topmost node in a tree is called the '''root node'''. Depending on definition, a tree may be required to have a root node (in which case all trees are non-empty), or may be allowed to be empty, in which case it does not necessarily have a root node. Being the topmost node, the root node will not have a parent. It is the node at which algorithms on the tree begin, since as a data structure, one can only pass from parents to children. Note that some algorithms (such as post-order depth-first search) begin at the root, but first visit leaf nodes (access the value of leaf nodes), only visit the root last (i.e., they first access the children of the root, but only access the value of the root last). All other nodes can be reached from it by following '''edges''' or '''links'''. (In the formal definition, each such path is also unique.) In diagrams, the root node is conventionally drawn at the top. In some trees, such as [[heap (data structure)|heaps]], the root node has special properties. Every node in a tree can be seen as the root node of the subtree rooted at that node.\n\nThe '''height''' of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The '''depth''' of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its ''root path''). This is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, [[AVL Trees]] in particular. The root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such are allowed) has height \u22121.\n\nA '''subtree''' of a tree {{mvar|T}} is a tree consisting of a node in {{mvar|T}} and all of its descendants in {{mvar|T}}.{{efn|This is different from the formal definition of subtree used in graph theory, which is a subgraph that forms a tree \u2013 it need not include all descendants. For example, the root node by itself is a subtree in the graph theory sense, but not in the data structure sense (unless there are no descendants).}}<ref>{{MathWorld|id=Subtree|title=Subtree}}</ref> Nodes thus correspond to subtrees (each node corresponds to the subtree of itself and all its descendants) \u2013 the subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree, and each node is the root node of the subtree it determines; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a '''proper subtree''' (by analogy to a [[proper subset]]).\n\n==Drawing trees==\nTrees are often drawn in the plane. Ordered trees can be represented essentially uniquely in the plane, and are hence called ''plane trees,'' as follows: if one fixes a conventional order (say, counterclockwise), and arranges the child nodes in that order (first incoming parent edge, then first child edge, etc.), this yields an embedding of the tree in the plane, unique up to [[ambient isotopy]]. Conversely, such an embedding determines an ordering of the child nodes.\n\nIf one places the root at the top (parents above children, as in a [[family tree]]) and places all nodes that are a given distance from the root (in terms of number of edges: the \"level\" of a tree) on a given horizontal line, one obtains a standard drawing of the tree. Given a binary tree, the first child is on the left (the \"left node\"), and the second child is on the right (the \"right node\").\n\n==Representations==\nThere are many different ways to represent trees; common representations represent the nodes as [[Dynamic memory allocation|dynamically allocated]] records with pointers to their children, their parents, or both, or as items in an [[Array data structure|array]], with relationships between them determined by their positions in the array (e.g., [[binary heap]]).\n\nIndeed, a binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists (a list where the values are lists): the head of a list (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree). This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp [[S-expression]]s, where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child.\n\nIn general a node in a tree will not have pointers to its parents, but this information can be included (expanding the data structure to also include a pointer to the parent) or stored separately. Alternatively, upward links can be included in the child node data, as in a [[threaded binary tree]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n===Digraphs===\nIf edges (to child nodes) are thought of as references, then a tree is a special case of a digraph, and the tree data structure can be generalized to represent [[directed graph]]s by removing the constraints that a node may have at most one parent, and that no cycles are allowed. Edges are still abstractly considered as pairs of nodes, however, the terms {{math|parent}} and {{math|child}} are usually replaced by different terminology (for example, {{math|source}} and {{math|target}}). Different [[graph (data structure)#Representations|implementation strategies]] exist: a digraph can be represented by the same local data structure as a tree (node with value and list of children), assuming that \"list of children\" is a list of references, or globally by such structures as [[adjacency list]]s.\n\nIn [[graph theory]], a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] is a connected acyclic [[Graph (data structure)|graph]]; unless stated otherwise, in graph theory trees and graphs are assumed undirected. There is no one-to-one correspondence between such trees and trees as data structure. We can take an arbitrary undirected tree, arbitrarily pick one of its [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] as the {{math|root}}, make all its edges directed by making them point away from the root node \u2013 producing an [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescence]] \u2013 and assign an order to all the nodes. The result corresponds to a tree data structure. Picking a different root or different ordering produces a different one.\n\nGiven a node in a tree, its children define an ordered forest (the union of subtrees given by all the children, or equivalently taking the subtree given by the node itself and erasing the root). Just as subtrees are natural for recursion (as in a depth-first search), forests are natural for [[corecursion]] (as in a breadth-first search).\n\nVia [[mutual recursion]], a forest can be defined as a list of trees (represented by root nodes), where a node (of a tree) consists of a value and a forest (its children):\n f: <nowiki>[n[1], ..., n[k]]</nowiki>\n n: v f\n\n==Traversal methods==\n{{Main article|Tree traversal}}\nStepping through the items of a tree, by means of the connections between parents and children, is called '''walking the tree''', and the action is a '{{math|walk}}' of the tree. Often, an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives at a particular node. A walk in which each parent node is traversed before its children is called a '''pre-order''' walk; a walk in which the children are traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a '''post-order''' walk; a walk in which a node's left subtree, then the node itself, and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an '''in-order''' traversal. (This last scenario, referring to exactly two subtrees, a left subtree and a right subtree, assumes specifically a [[binary tree]].)\nA '''level-order''' walk effectively performs a [[breadth-first search]] over the entirety of a tree; nodes are traversed level by level, where the root node is visited first, followed by its direct child nodes and their siblings, followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings, etc., until all nodes in the tree have been traversed.\n\n==Common operations==\n* Enumerating all the items\n* Enumerating a section of a tree\n* Searching for an item\n* Adding a new item at a certain position on the tree\n* Deleting an item\n* [[Pruning (algorithm)|Pruning]]: Removing a whole section of a tree\n* [[Grafting (algorithm)|Grafting]]: Adding a whole section to a tree\n* Finding the root for any node\n* Finding the [[lowest common ancestor]] of two nodes\n\n==Common uses==\n* Representing [[hierarchical]] data such as [[Abstract syntax tree|syntax tree]]s\n* Storing data in a way that makes it efficiently [[search algorithm|searchable]] (see [[binary search tree]] and [[tree traversal]])\n* Representing [[sorting algorithm|sorted lists]] of data\n* As a workflow for [[Digital compositing|compositing]] digital images for [[visual effects]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n* Storing [[Barnes-Hut]] trees used to simulate galaxies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tree structure]]\n* [[Tree (graph theory)]]\n* [[Tree (set theory)]]\n* [[Cardinal tree]] and [[Ordinal tree]]\n* [[Hierarchy (mathematics)]]\n* [[Dialog tree]]\n* [[Single inheritance]]\n* [[Generative grammar]]\n* [[Hierarchical clustering]]\n* [[Binary space partition tree]]\n* [[Recursion]]\n* [[Fenwick tree]]\n\n===Other trees===\n* [[Trie]]\n* [[Day\u2013Stout\u2013Warren algorithm]]\n* [[Enfilade (Xanadu)|Enfilade]]\n* [[Left child-right sibling binary tree]]\n* [[Hierarchical temporal memory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* [[Donald Knuth]].

Pyramids were the most common major structures built by ancient civilizations because the structural form of a pyramid is inherently stable and can be almost infinitely scaled (as opposed to most other structural forms, which cannot be linearly increased in size in proportion to increased loads).<ref name = Saouma/>\n\nThe structural stability of the pyramid, whilst primarily gained from its shape, relies also on the strength of the stone from which it is constructed, and its ability to support the weight of the stone above it.<ref name=Fonte>{{cite report|title=Building the Great Pyramid in a Year : An Engineer's Report |author=Fonte, Gerard C.

No theory of structures existed, and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of 'what had worked before'. Knowledge was retained by guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.<ref name=Saouma>{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|title=Lecture notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E.

Sometimes this is due to obvious negligence, as in the case of the [[2008 P\u00e9tion-ville school collapse|P\u00e9tion-Ville school collapse]], in which Rev. Fortin Augustin ''\"constructed the building all by himself, saying he didn't need an engineer as he had good knowledge of construction\"'' following a partial collapse of the three-story schoolhouse that sent neighbors fleeing. The final collapse killed 94 people, mostly children.\n\nIn other cases [[crash testing|structural failures]] require careful study, and the results of these inquiries have resulted in improved practices and greater understanding of the science of structural engineering.  Some such studies are the result of [[forensic engineering]] investigations where the original engineer seems to have done everything in accordance with the state of the profession and acceptable practice yet a failure still eventuated.  A famous case of structural knowledge and practice being advanced in this manner can be found in a series of failures involving [[box girders]] which collapsed in Australia during the 1970s.\n\n==Theory==\n{{Main article|Structural engineering theory}}\n[[File:Bolt-in-shear.svg|thumb|Figure of a [[Screw|bolt]] in [[shear stress]]. Top figure illustrates single shear, bottom figure illustrates double shear.]]\nStructural engineering depends upon a detailed knowledge of [[applied mechanics]], [[materials science]] and [[applied mathematics]] to understand and predict how structures support and resist self-weight and imposed loads. To apply the knowledge successfully a structural engineer generally requires detailed knowledge of relevant empirical and theoretical [[design codes]], the techniques of [[structural analysis]], as well as some knowledge of the [[corrosion]] resistance of the materials and structures, especially when those structures are exposed to the external environment. Since the 1990s, specialist software has become available to aid in the design of structures, with the functionality to assist in the drawing, analyzing and designing of structures with maximum precision; examples include [[AutoCAD]], StaadPro, [[Computers and Structures|ETABS]], Prokon, Revit Structure, Inducta RCB, etc. Such software may also take into consideration environmental loads, such as from earthquakes and winds.\n\n==Profession==\n{{Main article|Structural engineer}}\nStructural engineers are responsible for engineering design and structural analysis. Entry-level structural engineers may design the individual structural elements of a structure, such as the beams and columns of a building. More experienced engineers may be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building.\n\nStructural engineers often specialize in particular types of structures, such as buildings, bridges, pipelines, industrial, tunnels, vehicles, ships, aircraft and spacecraft.  Structural engineers who specialize in buildings often specialize in particular construction materials such as concrete, steel, wood, masonry, alloys and composites, and may focus on particular types of buildings such as offices, schools, hospitals, residential, and so forth.\n\nStructural engineering has existed since humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined and formalized profession with the emergence of the architecture as distinct profession from the engineering during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century. Until then, the architect and the structural engineer were usually one and the same thing \u2013 the master builder. Only with the development of specialized knowledge of structural theories that emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries, did the professional structural engineers come into existence.\n\nThe role of a structural engineer today involves a significant understanding of both static and dynamic loading, and the structures that are available to resist them. The complexity of modern structures often requires a great deal of creativity from the engineer in order to ensure the structures support and resist the loads they are subjected to. A structural engineer will typically have a four or five year undergraduate degree, followed by a minimum of three years of professional practice before being considered fully qualified.\nStructural engineers are licensed or accredited by different learned societies and regulatory bodies around the world (for example, the Institution of Structural Engineers in the UK). Depending on the degree course they have studied and/or the jurisdiction they are seeking licensure in, they may be accredited (or licensed) as just structural engineers, or as civil engineers, or as both civil and structural engineers.\nAnother international organisation is IABSE(International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering).<ref>[http://www.iabse.org/association/organisation/index.php IABSE \"Organisation\", ''iabse website''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806054537/http://www.iabse.org/association/organisation/index.php |date=2004-08-06 }}</ref> The aim of that association is to exchange knowledge and to advance the practice of structural engineering worldwide in the service of the profession and society.\n\n==Specializations==\n\n===Building structures===\n{{See also|Building engineering}}\n[[Image:Sydney Opera House Sails edit02.jpg|thumb|[[Sydney Opera House]], designed by Architect [[J\u00f8rn Utzon]] and structural design by [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup & Partners]]]]\n\n[[Image:Millennium Dome (zakgollop) version.jpg|thumb|right|[[Millennium Dome]] in London, UK, by [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Buro Happold]]]]\n\n[[Image:Burjdubaiaug92007.jpg|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]], in [[Dubai]], the [[world's tallest building]], shown under construction in 2007 (since completed)]]\n\nStructural building engineering includes all structural engineering related to the design of buildings. It is a branch of structural engineering closely affiliated with [[architecture]].\n\nStructural building engineering is primarily driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms and the underlying mathematical and scientific ideas to achieve an end which fulfills its functional requirements and is structurally safe when subjected to all the loads it could reasonably be expected to experience. This is subtly different from architectural design, which is driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms, mass, space, volume, texture and light to achieve an end which is aesthetic, functional and often artistic.\n\nThe architect is usually the lead designer on buildings, with a structural engineer employed as a sub-consultant. The degree to which each discipline actually leads the design depends heavily on the type of structure. Many structures are structurally simple and led by architecture, such as multi-storey office buildings and housing, while other structures, such as [[tensile structure]]s, [[Thin-shell structure|shells]] and [[gridshell]]s are heavily dependent on their form for their strength, and the engineer may have a more significant influence on the form, and hence much of the aesthetic, than the architect.\n\nThe structural design for a building must ensure that the building is able to stand up safely, able to function without excessive deflections or movements which may cause fatigue of structural elements, cracking or failure of fixtures, fittings or partitions, or discomfort for occupants. It must account for movements and forces due to temperature, [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], cracking and imposed loads. It must also ensure that the design is practically buildable within acceptable manufacturing tolerances of the materials. It must allow the architecture to work, and the building services to fit within the building and function (air conditioning, ventilation, smoke extract, electrics, lighting etc.). The structural design of a modern building can be extremely complex, and often requires a large team to complete.\n\nStructural engineering specialties for buildings include:\n*[[Earthquake engineering]]\n*[[Facade engineering|Fa\u00e7ade engineering]]\n*[[Fire engineering]]\n*[[Roof|Roof engineering]]\n*[[Tower|Tower engineering]]\n*[[Wind engineering]]\n\n===Earthquake engineering structures===\n{{Main article|Earthquake engineering structures}}\n'''Earthquake engineering structures''' are those engineered to withstand [[earthquake]]s.[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|left|Earthquake-proof pyramid [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]]]]\n\nThe main objectives of earthquake engineering are to understand the interaction of [[structure]]s with the shaking ground, foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes, and design and construct the structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] during an earthquake.\n\nEarthquake-proof structures are not necessarily extremely strong like the El Castillo pyramid at Chichen Itza shown above.\n\nOne important tool of [[earthquake engineering]] is [[base isolation]], which allows the base of a structure to move freely with the ground.\n\n===Civil engineering structures===\n\n[[Civil engineering|Civil structural engineering]] includes all structural engineering related to the built environment. It includes:\n\n{{div col|content=\n*[[Bridge]]s\n*[[Dam]]s\n*[[Earthworks (engineering)|Earthworks]]\n*[[Foundation (engineering)|Foundations]]\n*[[Offshore construction|Offshore structures]]\n*[[Pipeline transport|Pipelines]]\n*[[Power station]]s\n*[[Railways]]\n*[[Retaining wall|Retaining structures and walls]]\n*[[Roads]]\n*[[Tunnels]]\n*[[Waterways]]\n*[[Reservoirs]]\n*[[Water supply network|Water]] and [[Sewerage|wastewater]] infrastructure\n}}\n\nThe structural engineer is the lead designer on these structures, and often the sole designer. In the design of structures such as these, structural safety is of paramount importance (in the UK, designs for dams, nuclear power stations and bridges must be signed off by a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]]).\n\nCivil engineering structures are often subjected to very extreme forces, such as large variations in temperature, dynamic loads such as waves or traffic, or high pressures from water or compressed gases. They are also often constructed in corrosive environments, such as at sea, in industrial facilities or below ground.\n\n===Mechanical structures===\nThe principles of structural engineering are applicable to variety of mechanical (moveable) structures. The design of static structures assumes they always have the same geometry (in fact, so-called static structures can move significantly, and structural engineering design must take this into account where necessary), but the design of moveable or moving structures must account for [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], variation in the method in which load is resisted and significant deflections of structures.\n\nThe forces which parts of a machine are subjected to can vary significantly, and can do so at a great rate. The forces which a boat or aircraft are subjected to vary enormously and will do so thousands of times over the structure's lifetime. The structural design must ensure that such structures are able to endure such loading for their entire design life without failing.\n\nThese works can require mechanical structural engineering:\n\n*[[Pressure vessel|Boilers and pressure vessels]]\n*[[Coachwork|Coachworks and carriages]]\n*[[Crane (machine)|Cranes]]\n*[[Elevator]]s\n*[[Escalator]]s\n*[[Boat building|Marine vessels and hulls]]\n\n===Aerospace structures===\n[[Image:Airbus A380 blue sky.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Airbus A380]], the world's largest passenger airliner]]\n[[File:Patriot missile launch b.jpg|thumb|left| Design of missile needs in depth understanding of [[Structural Analysis]]]]\n\nAerospace structure types include launch vehicles, ([[Atlas]], [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]], Titan), [[missiles]] (ALCM, Harpoon), [[Hypersonic]] vehicles (Space Shuttle), [[military aircraft]] (F-16, F-18) and commercial aircraft ([[Boeing]] 777, MD-11). Aerospace structures typically consist of thin plates with stiffeners for the external surfaces, bulkheads and frames to support the shape and fasteners such as welds, rivets, screws and bolts to hold the components together.\n\n===Nanoscale structures===\nA [[nanostructure]] is an object of intermediate size between molecular and microscopic (micrometer-sized) structures. In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm. [[Nanotube]]s have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticles]] have three dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and ultrafine particles (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology.\n\n=== Structural engineering for medical science ===\n[[File:Marcelletti SO2.jpg|thumb|right| Designing medical equipment needs in-depth understanding of structural engineering]]\nMedical equipment (also known as armamentarium) is designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions. There are several basic types: [[diagnostic]] equipment includes medical imaging machines, used to aid in diagnosis; equipment includes infusion pumps, medical lasers and [[LASIK surgical machines]]; medical monitors allow medical staff to measure a patient's medical state. Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including [[ECG]], [[EEG]], blood pressure, and dissolved gases in the blood; diagnostic medical equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes, e.g. for the control of diabetes mellitus. A [[biomedical equipment technician]] (BMET) is a vital component of the healthcare delivery system. Employed primarily by hospitals, BMETs are the people responsible for maintaining a facility's medical equipment.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Structural elements==\n{{main article|Space frame}}\n[[Image:Bending.svg|thumb|right|A [[statically determinate]] simply supported beam, bending under an evenly distributed load.]]\nAny structure is essentially made up of only a small number of different types of elements:\n\n*[[Columns]]\n*[[Beam (structure)|Beams]]\n*[[Plate (structure)|Plates]]\n*[[Arch]]es\n*[[Thin-shell structure|Shells]]\n*[[Catenaries]]\n\nMany of these elements can be classified according to form (straight, plane / curve) and dimensionality (one-dimensional / two-dimensional):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |One-dimensional\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Two-dimensional\n|-\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |straight\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |curve\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |plane\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |curve\n|-\n|(predominantly) bending\n| align=\"center\" |[[Beam (structure)|beam]] || align=\"center\" | continuous [[arch]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[Plate (structures)|plate]], [[concrete slab]]  || align=\"center\"| [[planar lamina|lamina]], [[dome]]\n|-\n|(predominant) tensile stress\n| align=\"center\"|rope, tie || align=\"center\"|[[Catenary]]\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Thin-shell structure|shell]]\n|-\n|(predominant) compression\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Pier (architecture)|pier]], [[column]]\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Load-bearing wall]]\n|}\n\n===Columns===\n\n{{Main article|Column}}\n\nColumns are elements that carry only axial force (compression) or both axial force and bending (which is technically called a beam-column but practically, just a column). The design of a column must check the axial capacity of the element, and the buckling capacity.\n\nThe buckling capacity is the capacity of the element to withstand the propensity to buckle. Its capacity depends upon its geometry, material, and the effective length of the column, which depends upon the restraint conditions at the top and bottom of the column. The effective length is <math>K*l</math> where <math>l</math> is the real length of the column and K is the factor dependent on the restraint conditions.\n\nThe capacity of a column to carry axial load depends on the degree of bending it is subjected to, and vice versa. This is represented on an interaction chart and is a complex non-linear relationship.\n\n===Beams===\n{{Main article|Beam (structure)|l1=Beam}}\n[[Image:The Little Belt Bridge (1935).jpeg|thumb|[[Little Belt Bridge|''Little Belt'']]: a [[truss bridge]] in [[Denmark]]]]\nA beam may be defined as an element in which one dimension is much greater than the other two and the applied loads are usually normal to the main axis of the element. Beams and columns are called line elements and are often represented by simple lines in structural modeling.\n\n*[[cantilever]]ed (supported at one end only with a fixed connection)\n*simply supported (fixed against vertical translation at each end and horizontal translation at one end only,  and able to rotate at the supports)\n*fixed (supported in all directions for translation and rotation at each end)\n*continuous (supported by three or more supports)\n* a combination of the above (ex. supported at one end and in the middle)\n\nBeams are elements which carry pure bending only. Bending causes one part of the section of a beam (divided along its length) to go into compression and the other part into tension. The compression part must be designed to resist buckling and crushing, while the tension part must be able to adequately resist the tension.\n\n===Trusses===\n{{Main article|Truss}}\n[[Image:McDonnell-Planetarium.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell Planetarium by [[Gyo Obata]] in [[St Louis, Missouri]], USA, a concrete shell structure]]\n[[Image:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|right|The 630 foot (192 m) high, stainless-clad (type 304) [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial#The Gateway Arch|Gateway Arch]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]]]\n\nA [[truss]] is a structure comprising members and connection points or nodes. When members are connected at nodes and forces are applied at nodes members can act in tension or in compression. Members acting in compression are referred to as compression members or [[strut]]s while members acting in tension are referred to as tension members or [[Tie (engineering)|ties]]. Most trusses use [[gusset plates]] to connect intersecting elements.  Gusset plates are relatively flexible and unable to transfer [[bending moment]]s. The connection is usually arranged so that the lines of force in the members are coincident at the joint thus allowing the truss members to act in pure tension or compression.\n\nTrusses are usually used in large-span structures, where it would be uneconomical to use solid beams.\n\n===Plates===\n{{Main|Plate (structure)}}\n\nPlates carry bending in two directions. A concrete flat slab is an example of a plate. Plates are understood by using [[continuum mechanics]], but due to the complexity involved they are most often designed using a codified empirical approach, or computer analysis.\n\nThey can also be designed with yield line theory, where an assumed collapse mechanism is analysed to give an upper bound on the collapse load (see [[#Plasticity|Plasticity]]). This technique is used in practice <ref>http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/precast_roof_slabs.pdf</ref> but because the method provides an upper-bound, i.e. an unsafe prediction of the collapse load, for poorly conceived collapse mechanisms great care is needed to ensure that the assumed collapse mechanism is realistic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/l_shaped_landing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071038/http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/l_shaped_landing.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Shells===\n\n{{Main article|Thin-shell structure}}\n{{See also|Gridshell}}\n\nShells derive their strength from their form, and carry forces in compression in two directions. A dome is an example of a shell. They can be designed by making a hanging-chain model, which will act as a catenary in pure tension, and inverting the form to achieve pure compression.\n\n===Arches===\n{{Main article|Arch}}\n\nArches carry forces in compression in one direction only, which is why it is appropriate to build arches out of masonry. They are designed by ensuring that the [[line of thrust]] of the force remains within the depth of the arch. It is mainly used to increase the bountifulness of any structure.\n\n===Catenaries===\n{{Main article|Tensile structure}}\nCatenaries derive their strength from their form, and carry transverse forces in pure tension by deflecting (just as a tightrope will sag when someone walks on it). They are almost always cable or fabric structures. A fabric structure acts as a catenary in two directions.\n<!--\n===Seismic base isolators===\n{{main|Vibration control}}\n\n[[Base isolation]] is a collection of structural elements of a building that should substantially [[decouple]] the building's [[superstructure]] from the shaking ground thus protecting the building's integrity and improving its [[seismic performance]]; see, e.g., the shake table testing of a kind of ''' seismic base isolators''' called [[Earthquake Protector]]s. This technology, which is a kind of seismic [[vibration control]], can be applied both to newly designed buildings and to seismic upgrading of existing structures. Normally, excavations are made around the building which is separated from its foundation. Steel or reinforced concrete beams replace the connections to the foundation, while under these, the isolating pads, or '''seismic base isolators''', replace the material removed. While the [[base isolation]] tends to restrict transmission of the ground motion to the building, it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation.\n-->\n\n==Materials==\n{{Main article|Structural material}}\nStructural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads.\n\nCommon structural materials are:\n*[[Iron]]: [[wrought iron]], [[cast iron]] \n*[[Concrete]]: [[reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]]\n*[[Alloy]]: [[steel]], [[stainless steel]]\n*[[Masonry]]\n*[[Timber]]: [[hardwood]], [[softwood]]\n*[[Aluminium]]\n*[[Composite material]]s: [[plywood]]\n*Other structural materials: [[adobe]], [[bamboo]], [[carbon fibre]], [[fiber reinforced plastic]], [[mudbrick]], [[roofing material]]s\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Glossary of structural engineering]]\n*[[Aircraft structures]]\n*[[Architects]]\n*[[Architectural engineering]]\n*[[Building officials]]\n*[[Building services engineering]]\n*[[Civil engineering]]\n*[[Construction engineering]]\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Earthquake engineering]]\n*[[Forensic engineering]]\n*[[Index of structural engineering articles]]\n*[[List of bridge disasters]]\n*[[List of structural engineers]]\n*[[Mechanical engineering]]\n*[[Nanostructure]]\n*[[Prestressed structure]]\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Structural engineer]]\n*[[Structural engineering software]]\n*[[Structural fracture mechanics]]\n*[[Structural failure]]\n*[[Structural robustness]]\n*[[Structural steel]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Hibbeler, R.

No theory of structures existed, and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of 'what had worked before'. Knowledge was retained by guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.<ref name=Saouma>{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|title=Lecture notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E.

Topp's paper on the \"Stiffness and Deflection of Complex Structures\" introduces the name \"finite-element method\" and is widely recognized as the first comprehensive treatment of the method as it is known today\n\n===Structural failure===\n{{Main article|Structural failure|List of structural failures and collapses}}\nThe history of structural engineering contains many collapses and failures.  Sometimes this is due to obvious negligence, as in the case of the [[2008 P\u00e9tion-ville school collapse|P\u00e9tion-Ville school collapse]], in which Rev. Fortin Augustin ''\"constructed the building all by himself, saying he didn't need an engineer as he had good knowledge of construction\"'' following a partial collapse of the three-story schoolhouse that sent neighbors fleeing. The final collapse killed 94 people, mostly children.\n\nIn other cases [[crash testing|structural failures]] require careful study, and the results of these inquiries have resulted in improved practices and greater understanding of the science of structural engineering.  Some such studies are the result of [[forensic engineering]] investigations where the original engineer seems to have done everything in accordance with the state of the profession and acceptable practice yet a failure still eventuated.  A famous case of structural knowledge and practice being advanced in this manner can be found in a series of failures involving [[box girders]] which collapsed in Australia during the 1970s.\n\n==Theory==\n{{Main article|Structural engineering theory}}\n[[File:Bolt-in-shear.svg|thumb|Figure of a [[Screw|bolt]] in [[shear stress]]. Top figure illustrates single shear, bottom figure illustrates double shear.]]\nStructural engineering depends upon a detailed knowledge of [[applied mechanics]], [[materials science]] and [[applied mathematics]] to understand and predict how structures support and resist self-weight and imposed loads. To apply the knowledge successfully a structural engineer generally requires detailed knowledge of relevant empirical and theoretical [[design codes]], the techniques of [[structural analysis]], as well as some knowledge of the [[corrosion]] resistance of the materials and structures, especially when those structures are exposed to the external environment. Since the 1990s, specialist software has become available to aid in the design of structures, with the functionality to assist in the drawing, analyzing and designing of structures with maximum precision; examples include [[AutoCAD]], StaadPro, [[Computers and Structures|ETABS]], Prokon, Revit Structure, Inducta RCB, etc. Such software may also take into consideration environmental loads, such as from earthquakes and winds.\n\n==Profession==\n{{Main article|Structural engineer}}\nStructural engineers are responsible for engineering design and structural analysis. Entry-level structural engineers may design the individual structural elements of a structure, such as the beams and columns of a building. More experienced engineers may be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building.\n\nStructural engineers often specialize in particular types of structures, such as buildings, bridges, pipelines, industrial, tunnels, vehicles, ships, aircraft and spacecraft.  Structural engineers who specialize in buildings often specialize in particular construction materials such as concrete, steel, wood, masonry, alloys and composites, and may focus on particular types of buildings such as offices, schools, hospitals, residential, and so forth.\n\nStructural engineering has existed since humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined and formalized profession with the emergence of the architecture as distinct profession from the engineering during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century. Until then, the architect and the structural engineer were usually one and the same thing \u2013 the master builder. Only with the development of specialized knowledge of structural theories that emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries, did the professional structural engineers come into existence.\n\nThe role of a structural engineer today involves a significant understanding of both static and dynamic loading, and the structures that are available to resist them. The complexity of modern structures often requires a great deal of creativity from the engineer in order to ensure the structures support and resist the loads they are subjected to. A structural engineer will typically have a four or five year undergraduate degree, followed by a minimum of three years of professional practice before being considered fully qualified.\nStructural engineers are licensed or accredited by different learned societies and regulatory bodies around the world (for example, the Institution of Structural Engineers in the UK). Depending on the degree course they have studied and/or the jurisdiction they are seeking licensure in, they may be accredited (or licensed) as just structural engineers, or as civil engineers, or as both civil and structural engineers.\nAnother international organisation is IABSE(International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering).<ref>[http://www.iabse.org/association/organisation/index.php IABSE \"Organisation\", ''iabse website''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806054537/http://www.iabse.org/association/organisation/index.php |date=2004-08-06 }}</ref> The aim of that association is to exchange knowledge and to advance the practice of structural engineering worldwide in the service of the profession and society.\n\n==Specializations==\n\n===Building structures===\n{{See also|Building engineering}}\n[[Image:Sydney Opera House Sails edit02.jpg|thumb|[[Sydney Opera House]], designed by Architect [[J\u00f8rn Utzon]] and structural design by [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup & Partners]]]]\n\n[[Image:Millennium Dome (zakgollop) version.jpg|thumb|right|[[Millennium Dome]] in London, UK, by [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Buro Happold]]]]\n\n[[Image:Burjdubaiaug92007.jpg|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]], in [[Dubai]], the [[world's tallest building]], shown under construction in 2007 (since completed)]]\n\nStructural building engineering includes all structural engineering related to the design of buildings. It is a branch of structural engineering closely affiliated with [[architecture]].\n\nStructural building engineering is primarily driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms and the underlying mathematical and scientific ideas to achieve an end which fulfills its functional requirements and is structurally safe when subjected to all the loads it could reasonably be expected to experience. This is subtly different from architectural design, which is driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms, mass, space, volume, texture and light to achieve an end which is aesthetic, functional and often artistic.\n\nThe architect is usually the lead designer on buildings, with a structural engineer employed as a sub-consultant. The degree to which each discipline actually leads the design depends heavily on the type of structure. Many structures are structurally simple and led by architecture, such as multi-storey office buildings and housing, while other structures, such as [[tensile structure]]s, [[Thin-shell structure|shells]] and [[gridshell]]s are heavily dependent on their form for their strength, and the engineer may have a more significant influence on the form, and hence much of the aesthetic, than the architect.\n\nThe structural design for a building must ensure that the building is able to stand up safely, able to function without excessive deflections or movements which may cause fatigue of structural elements, cracking or failure of fixtures, fittings or partitions, or discomfort for occupants. It must account for movements and forces due to temperature, [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], cracking and imposed loads. It must also ensure that the design is practically buildable within acceptable manufacturing tolerances of the materials. It must allow the architecture to work, and the building services to fit within the building and function (air conditioning, ventilation, smoke extract, electrics, lighting etc.). The structural design of a modern building can be extremely complex, and often requires a large team to complete.\n\nStructural engineering specialties for buildings include:\n*[[Earthquake engineering]]\n*[[Facade engineering|Fa\u00e7ade engineering]]\n*[[Fire engineering]]\n*[[Roof|Roof engineering]]\n*[[Tower|Tower engineering]]\n*[[Wind engineering]]\n\n===Earthquake engineering structures===\n{{Main article|Earthquake engineering structures}}\n'''Earthquake engineering structures''' are those engineered to withstand [[earthquake]]s.[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|left|Earthquake-proof pyramid [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]]]]\n\nThe main objectives of earthquake engineering are to understand the interaction of [[structure]]s with the shaking ground, foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes, and design and construct the structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] during an earthquake.\n\nEarthquake-proof structures are not necessarily extremely strong like the El Castillo pyramid at Chichen Itza shown above.\n\nOne important tool of [[earthquake engineering]] is [[base isolation]], which allows the base of a structure to move freely with the ground.\n\n===Civil engineering structures===\n\n[[Civil engineering|Civil structural engineering]] includes all structural engineering related to the built environment. It includes:\n\n{{div col|content=\n*[[Bridge]]s\n*[[Dam]]s\n*[[Earthworks (engineering)|Earthworks]]\n*[[Foundation (engineering)|Foundations]]\n*[[Offshore construction|Offshore structures]]\n*[[Pipeline transport|Pipelines]]\n*[[Power station]]s\n*[[Railways]]\n*[[Retaining wall|Retaining structures and walls]]\n*[[Roads]]\n*[[Tunnels]]\n*[[Waterways]]\n*[[Reservoirs]]\n*[[Water supply network|Water]] and [[Sewerage|wastewater]] infrastructure\n}}\n\nThe structural engineer is the lead designer on these structures, and often the sole designer. In the design of structures such as these, structural safety is of paramount importance (in the UK, designs for dams, nuclear power stations and bridges must be signed off by a [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]]).\n\nCivil engineering structures are often subjected to very extreme forces, such as large variations in temperature, dynamic loads such as waves or traffic, or high pressures from water or compressed gases. They are also often constructed in corrosive environments, such as at sea, in industrial facilities or below ground.\n\n===Mechanical structures===\nThe principles of structural engineering are applicable to variety of mechanical (moveable) structures. The design of static structures assumes they always have the same geometry (in fact, so-called static structures can move significantly, and structural engineering design must take this into account where necessary), but the design of moveable or moving structures must account for [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], variation in the method in which load is resisted and significant deflections of structures.\n\nThe forces which parts of a machine are subjected to can vary significantly, and can do so at a great rate. The forces which a boat or aircraft are subjected to vary enormously and will do so thousands of times over the structure's lifetime. The structural design must ensure that such structures are able to endure such loading for their entire design life without failing.\n\nThese works can require mechanical structural engineering:\n\n*[[Pressure vessel|Boilers and pressure vessels]]\n*[[Coachwork|Coachworks and carriages]]\n*[[Crane (machine)|Cranes]]\n*[[Elevator]]s\n*[[Escalator]]s\n*[[Boat building|Marine vessels and hulls]]\n\n===Aerospace structures===\n[[Image:Airbus A380 blue sky.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Airbus A380]], the world's largest passenger airliner]]\n[[File:Patriot missile launch b.jpg|thumb|left| Design of missile needs in depth understanding of [[Structural Analysis]]]]\n\nAerospace structure types include launch vehicles, ([[Atlas]], [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]], Titan), [[missiles]] (ALCM, Harpoon), [[Hypersonic]] vehicles (Space Shuttle), [[military aircraft]] (F-16, F-18) and commercial aircraft ([[Boeing]] 777, MD-11). Aerospace structures typically consist of thin plates with stiffeners for the external surfaces, bulkheads and frames to support the shape and fasteners such as welds, rivets, screws and bolts to hold the components together.\n\n===Nanoscale structures===\nA [[nanostructure]] is an object of intermediate size between molecular and microscopic (micrometer-sized) structures. In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm. [[Nanotube]]s have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticles]] have three dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and ultrafine particles (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology.\n\n=== Structural engineering for medical science ===\n[[File:Marcelletti SO2.jpg|thumb|right| Designing medical equipment needs in-depth understanding of structural engineering]]\nMedical equipment (also known as armamentarium) is designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions. There are several basic types: [[diagnostic]] equipment includes medical imaging machines, used to aid in diagnosis; equipment includes infusion pumps, medical lasers and [[LASIK surgical machines]]; medical monitors allow medical staff to measure a patient's medical state. Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including [[ECG]], [[EEG]], blood pressure, and dissolved gases in the blood; diagnostic medical equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes, e.g. for the control of diabetes mellitus. A [[biomedical equipment technician]] (BMET) is a vital component of the healthcare delivery system. Employed primarily by hospitals, BMETs are the people responsible for maintaining a facility's medical equipment.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Structural elements==\n{{main article|Space frame}}\n[[Image:Bending.svg|thumb|right|A [[statically determinate]] simply supported beam, bending under an evenly distributed load.]]\nAny structure is essentially made up of only a small number of different types of elements:\n\n*[[Columns]]\n*[[Beam (structure)|Beams]]\n*[[Plate (structure)|Plates]]\n*[[Arch]]es\n*[[Thin-shell structure|Shells]]\n*[[Catenaries]]\n\nMany of these elements can be classified according to form (straight, plane / curve) and dimensionality (one-dimensional / two-dimensional):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |One-dimensional\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Two-dimensional\n|-\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |straight\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |curve\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |plane\n!style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" |curve\n|-\n|(predominantly) bending\n| align=\"center\" |[[Beam (structure)|beam]] || align=\"center\" | continuous [[arch]]\n| align=\"center\" |[[Plate (structures)|plate]], [[concrete slab]]  || align=\"center\"| [[planar lamina|lamina]], [[dome]]\n|-\n|(predominant) tensile stress\n| align=\"center\"|rope, tie || align=\"center\"|[[Catenary]]\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Thin-shell structure|shell]]\n|-\n|(predominant) compression\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Pier (architecture)|pier]], [[column]]\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Load-bearing wall]]\n|}\n\n===Columns===\n\n{{Main article|Column}}\n\nColumns are elements that carry only axial force (compression) or both axial force and bending (which is technically called a beam-column but practically, just a column). The design of a column must check the axial capacity of the element, and the buckling capacity.\n\nThe buckling capacity is the capacity of the element to withstand the propensity to buckle. Its capacity depends upon its geometry, material, and the effective length of the column, which depends upon the restraint conditions at the top and bottom of the column. The effective length is <math>K*l</math> where <math>l</math> is the real length of the column and K is the factor dependent on the restraint conditions.\n\nThe capacity of a column to carry axial load depends on the degree of bending it is subjected to, and vice versa. This is represented on an interaction chart and is a complex non-linear relationship.\n\n===Beams===\n{{Main article|Beam (structure)|l1=Beam}}\n[[Image:The Little Belt Bridge (1935).jpeg|thumb|[[Little Belt Bridge|''Little Belt'']]: a [[truss bridge]] in [[Denmark]]]]\nA beam may be defined as an element in which one dimension is much greater than the other two and the applied loads are usually normal to the main axis of the element. Beams and columns are called line elements and are often represented by simple lines in structural modeling.\n\n*[[cantilever]]ed (supported at one end only with a fixed connection)\n*simply supported (fixed against vertical translation at each end and horizontal translation at one end only,  and able to rotate at the supports)\n*fixed (supported in all directions for translation and rotation at each end)\n*continuous (supported by three or more supports)\n* a combination of the above (ex. supported at one end and in the middle)\n\nBeams are elements which carry pure bending only. Bending causes one part of the section of a beam (divided along its length) to go into compression and the other part into tension. The compression part must be designed to resist buckling and crushing, while the tension part must be able to adequately resist the tension.\n\n===Trusses===\n{{Main article|Truss}}\n[[Image:McDonnell-Planetarium.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell Planetarium by [[Gyo Obata]] in [[St Louis, Missouri]], USA, a concrete shell structure]]\n[[Image:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|right|The 630 foot (192 m) high, stainless-clad (type 304) [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial#The Gateway Arch|Gateway Arch]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]]]\n\nA [[truss]] is a structure comprising members and connection points or nodes. When members are connected at nodes and forces are applied at nodes members can act in tension or in compression. Members acting in compression are referred to as compression members or [[strut]]s while members acting in tension are referred to as tension members or [[Tie (engineering)|ties]]. Most trusses use [[gusset plates]] to connect intersecting elements.  Gusset plates are relatively flexible and unable to transfer [[bending moment]]s. The connection is usually arranged so that the lines of force in the members are coincident at the joint thus allowing the truss members to act in pure tension or compression.\n\nTrusses are usually used in large-span structures, where it would be uneconomical to use solid beams.\n\n===Plates===\n{{Main|Plate (structure)}}\n\nPlates carry bending in two directions. A concrete flat slab is an example of a plate. Plates are understood by using [[continuum mechanics]], but due to the complexity involved they are most often designed using a codified empirical approach, or computer analysis.\n\nThey can also be designed with yield line theory, where an assumed collapse mechanism is analysed to give an upper bound on the collapse load (see [[#Plasticity|Plasticity]]). This technique is used in practice <ref>http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/precast_roof_slabs.pdf</ref> but because the method provides an upper-bound, i.e. an unsafe prediction of the collapse load, for poorly conceived collapse mechanisms great care is needed to ensure that the assumed collapse mechanism is realistic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/l_shaped_landing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071038/http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/downloads/l_shaped_landing.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Shells===\n\n{{Main article|Thin-shell structure}}\n{{See also|Gridshell}}\n\nShells derive their strength from their form, and carry forces in compression in two directions. A dome is an example of a shell. They can be designed by making a hanging-chain model, which will act as a catenary in pure tension, and inverting the form to achieve pure compression.\n\n===Arches===\n{{Main article|Arch}}\n\nArches carry forces in compression in one direction only, which is why it is appropriate to build arches out of masonry. They are designed by ensuring that the [[line of thrust]] of the force remains within the depth of the arch. It is mainly used to increase the bountifulness of any structure.\n\n===Catenaries===\n{{Main article|Tensile structure}}\nCatenaries derive their strength from their form, and carry transverse forces in pure tension by deflecting (just as a tightrope will sag when someone walks on it). They are almost always cable or fabric structures. A fabric structure acts as a catenary in two directions.\n<!--\n===Seismic base isolators===\n{{main|Vibration control}}\n\n[[Base isolation]] is a collection of structural elements of a building that should substantially [[decouple]] the building's [[superstructure]] from the shaking ground thus protecting the building's integrity and improving its [[seismic performance]]; see, e.g., the shake table testing of a kind of ''' seismic base isolators''' called [[Earthquake Protector]]s. This technology, which is a kind of seismic [[vibration control]], can be applied both to newly designed buildings and to seismic upgrading of existing structures. Normally, excavations are made around the building which is separated from its foundation. Steel or reinforced concrete beams replace the connections to the foundation, while under these, the isolating pads, or '''seismic base isolators''', replace the material removed. While the [[base isolation]] tends to restrict transmission of the ground motion to the building, it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation.\n-->\n\n==Materials==\n{{Main article|Structural material}}\nStructural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads.\n\nCommon structural materials are:\n*[[Iron]]: [[wrought iron]], [[cast iron]] \n*[[Concrete]]: [[reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]]\n*[[Alloy]]: [[steel]], [[stainless steel]]\n*[[Masonry]]\n*[[Timber]]: [[hardwood]], [[softwood]]\n*[[Aluminium]]\n*[[Composite material]]s: [[plywood]]\n*Other structural materials: [[adobe]], [[bamboo]], [[carbon fibre]], [[fiber reinforced plastic]], [[mudbrick]], [[roofing material]]s\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Glossary of structural engineering]]\n*[[Aircraft structures]]\n*[[Architects]]\n*[[Architectural engineering]]\n*[[Building officials]]\n*[[Building services engineering]]\n*[[Civil engineering]]\n*[[Construction engineering]]\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Earthquake engineering]]\n*[[Forensic engineering]]\n*[[Index of structural engineering articles]]\n*[[List of bridge disasters]]\n*[[List of structural engineers]]\n*[[Mechanical engineering]]\n*[[Nanostructure]]\n*[[Prestressed structure]]\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Structural engineer]]\n*[[Structural engineering software]]\n*[[Structural fracture mechanics]]\n*[[Structural failure]]\n*[[Structural robustness]]\n*[[Structural steel]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Hibbeler, R.

{"title_page": "Aberaman (electoral ward)", "text_new": "The community of '''[[Aberaman]]''', [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]] was an [[Ward (politics)|electoral ward]] for much of the twentieth century, for the purposes of electing members to [[Glamorgan County Council, 1889-1974|Glamorgan County Council]] and the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]]. It currently comprises two [[Ward (politics)|electoral wards]], [[Aberaman North (electoral ward)|Aberaman North]] and [[Aberaman South (electoral ward)|Aberaman South]], for the purposes of electing members to the [[Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council]]. Aberaman North is composed mainly of [[Aberaman]] itself while [[Aberaman South]] includes [[Abercwmboi]], [[Cwmaman]], Godreaman and Glynhafod.\n\nAberaman first became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of [[Glamorgan County Council]]. Aberaman was also one of the five electoral wards of the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]] from its formation in 1894. The other wards were [[Aberdare Town (electoral ward)|Aberdare Town]], Blaengwawr, [[Gadlys (electoral ward)|Gadlys]] and [[Llwydcoed (electoral ward)|Llwydcoed]].\n\n==History 1889-1914==\nRepresentation of the ward in the 1890s was dominated by supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] although elections were often not fought on political lines and the local influence and standing of individual candidates was an important factor.  This enabled [[Edmund Mills Hann]], a prominent figure in the [[Powell Duffryn]] company, although unsuccessful at county level in 1889, to hold a seat on the Aberdare UDC for most of this period. Significantly he continued to hold a seat at Aberaman after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] captured several of the district seats in the early years of the new century. One of the most significant contests was that in 1903 (see below) for the Aberdare UDC when William Rees, a Labour candidate and deacon, unseated [[Thomas Humphreys (Baptist minister)|Thomas Humphreys]], minister of [[Seion, Cwmaman]].\n \n===Glamorgan County Council 1889-1914===\nIn [[1889 Glamorgan County Council election|1889]], Thomas Philip White was elected as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] member for Aberaman, defeating [[Edmund Mills Hann]]. This contest was widely reported and was a significant victory for a local tradesman, T.P. White, over a leading colliery official who later became a prominent figure in the South Wales and Monmouthshire Coalowners' Association. White had been chosen as Liberal candidate after a public meeting at [[Saron, Aberaman|Saron Chapel, Aberaman]]. In a letter to the press he referred to pressure from colliery officials and sought to re-assure the electors that there was a secret ballot.<ref name=\"TG 13-12-88 TPW letter\">{{cite news|title=Aberdar.

It currently comprises two [[Ward (politics)|electoral wards]], [[Aberaman North (electoral ward)|Aberaman North]] and [[Aberaman South (electoral ward)|Aberaman South]], for the purposes of electing members to the [[Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council]]. Aberaman North is composed mainly of [[Aberaman]] itself while [[Aberaman South]] includes [[Abercwmboi]], [[Cwmaman]], Godreaman and Glynhafod.\n\nAberaman first became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of [[Glamorgan County Council]]. Aberaman was also one of the five electoral wards of the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]] from its formation in 1894. The other wards were [[Aberdare Town (electoral ward)|Aberdare Town]], Blaengwawr, [[Gadlys (electoral ward)|Gadlys]] and [[Llwydcoed (electoral ward)|Llwydcoed]].\n\n==History 1889-1914==\nRepresentation of the ward in the 1890s was dominated by supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] although elections were often not fought on political lines and the local influence and standing of individual candidates was an important factor.  This enabled [[Edmund Mills Hann]], a prominent figure in the [[Powell Duffryn]] company, although unsuccessful at county level in 1889, to hold a seat on the Aberdare UDC for most of this period. Significantly he continued to hold a seat at Aberaman after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] captured several of the district seats in the early years of the new century. One of the most significant contests was that in 1903 (see below) for the Aberdare UDC when William Rees, a Labour candidate and deacon, unseated [[Thomas Humphreys (Baptist minister)|Thomas Humphreys]], minister of [[Seion, Cwmaman]].\n \n===Glamorgan County Council 1889-1914===\nIn [[1889 Glamorgan County Council election|1889]], Thomas Philip White was elected as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] member for Aberaman, defeating [[Edmund Mills Hann]]. This contest was widely reported and was a significant victory for a local tradesman, T.P. White, over a leading colliery official who later became a prominent figure in the South Wales and Monmouthshire Coalowners' Association. White had been chosen as Liberal candidate after a public meeting at [[Saron, Aberaman|Saron Chapel, Aberaman]]. In a letter to the press he referred to pressure from colliery officials and sought to re-assure the electors that there was a secret ballot.<ref name=\"TG 13-12-88 TPW letter\">{{cite news|title=Aberdar.

From  1995 to 1998 he was Professor of Anthropology and Professor at the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the [[University of Michigan]]. In 1998 he moved to the University of Arizona, where he was appointed Professor of Anthropology, and since 2002 also Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.<ref name=\"CV 2014\"/> From 2015 to 2019 he was Director of the Complexoty Institute and Professor in the Asian School of Environment at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nSince 1999 Lansing participates in the Santa Fe Institute, first as External Professor, from 2002 to 2007 as Professor an since 2007 as External Professor.

Later research showed that over the centuries, water temple networks expanded to manage the ecology of rice terraces at the scale of whole watersheds. In 2012, Bali\u2019s water temple networks were recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage. In 2019, the story of the water temple research was the focus of an exhibition by a team of architects, artists and researchers from ETH Zurich at the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, \"Priests and Progammers.\" \u00a0The principles of adaptive self-organized criticality are now being used to guide research on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from Balinese rice terraces. \t\t\n\nAs the pieces of the water temple story were falling into place, Lansing became interested in self-organizing processes elsewhere in the archipelago. In 2000 he began to work with Indonesian geneticists, linguists and public health officials to study the co-evolution of social structure, language change and disease resistance on  islands in the Malay archipelago. The story  is told in Islands of Order: A Guide to Complexity Modeling for the Social Sciences (Princeton University Press 2019 and companion website <nowiki>https://www.islandsoforder.com</nowiki>).\n\nIn May 2018 Lansing discovered a group of cave-dwelling hunter-gatherers in Indonesian Borneo, and began working with the Leakey Foundation and the Nature Conservancy to help them preserve their forest home.\n\nLansing's research interests range from \"complexity and anthropology, sociocultural  theory,  ecological anthropology, resilience, social-ecological systems, Indonesian and Austronesian ethnography and prehistory, and ethnographic film.\"<ref name=\"CV 2014\" /> \n\n== Selected publications ==\n* Lansing, J.
