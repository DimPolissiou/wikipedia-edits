Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

He began his training in Germany after emigrating from [[Kosovo]] and initially competed as a -79&nbsp;kg/174&nbsp;lb fighter before moving up through the weight classes until eventually reaching heavyweight. After stints as a German and European champion, Kabashi won the [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] World Heavyweight Muay Thai title in 2008. Although he defended this belt numerous times and had an impressive 80% [[knockout]] ratio, he rarely fought outside him hometown of [[Munich]] or against top-ranked competition, and so was never considered elite at any weight class.<ref>[http://www.thmnews.com/wka-world-champion-besim-kabashi-tiger-muay-thai-training-highlight-reel.html Besim Kabashi]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe died from a heart attack in December 2011.\n\n==Early life==\nKabashi was born as the youngest of seven children to [[Kosovar Albanian]] parents near [[Istok]], [[Yugoslavia]] in 1976 and moved to Munich, Germany at the age of fourteen. He competed in athletics, football and swimming as a youngster before he began kickboxing when he was seventeen.<ref>[http://www.albanianboxing.com/legjendat/besim-kabashi.html Biografia e kikboksierit Besim Kabashi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010222034/http://www.albanianboxing.com/legjendat/besim-kabashi.html |date=October 10, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter successful careers in amateur boxing and kickboxing, Kabashi turned professional in 1997 and won the [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] German Light Heavyweight (-79&nbsp;kg/174&nbsp;lb) Championship in his debut year. He then followed this up by taking the WKA German Super Light Heavyweight (-83.2&nbsp;kg/183&nbsp;lb) title the following year. Despite a promising start to his career, Kabashi would then retire from the sport in 2002 following a disagreement with his trainer.\n\nHe returned to the ring in 2006, weighing in at 102&nbsp;kg/224&nbsp;lb. His transition to heavyweight saw him have success almost immediately as he [[Knockout|knocked out]] Zoran Dorcic in round two to become the WKA European Super Heavyweight (+95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Champion in 2007. He then won the WKA World Heavyweight (-95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Muay Thai belt on December 13, 2008 when he defeated Yahya G\u00fclay by fourth round [[technical knockout]]. Kabashi defended this title seven times over the next three years against the likes of [[David Dancrade]] and [[Petr Vondr\u00e1\u010dek]] before his untimely death in December 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.telajmi.com/lajmi/6888/besim-kabashi-mposht-petr-vondracek-me-ko-n-raundin-4.html |title=Besim Kabashi mposht Petr Vondracek me KO n\u00eb raundin 4 |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126011613/http://www.telajmi.com/lajmi/6888/besim-kabashi-mposht-petr-vondracek-me-ko-n-raundin-4.html |archive-date=2013-01-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nKabashi was found dead in his apartment in Munich, Germany on Sunday December 4, 2011.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/muenchen/muenchen/der-seltsame-tod-des-thai-boxers-kabashi-21413824.bild.html\n|title=Der seltsame Tod des Thai-Boxers\n|language=German\n|publisher=[[Bild]]\n|date= 2011-12-06\n|accessdate=2012-02-19\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/sport/Toter-Kickboxer-Raetsel-um-angeblichen-Abschiedsbrief-id17937481.html\n|title=Toter Kickboxer: R\u00e4tsel um angeblichen Abschiedsbrief\n|language=German\n|publisher=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]\n|date=2011-12-15\n|accessdate=2012-02-19\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213135647/http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/sport/Toter-Kickboxer-Raetsel-um-angeblichen-Abschiedsbrief-id17937481.html\n|archive-date=2012-02-13\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==Championships and awards==\n\n===Kickboxing===\n*'''[[World Kickboxing Association]]'''\n**WKA German Light Heavyweight (-79&nbsp;kg/174&nbsp;lb) Championship\n**WKA German Super Light Heavyweight (-83.2&nbsp;kg/183&nbsp;lb) Championship\n**WKA European Super Heavyweight (+95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Championship\n**WKA World Heavyweight (-95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Muay Thai Championship\n\n== Kickboxing record ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=100% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

After stints as a German and European champion, Kabashi won the [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] World Heavyweight Muay Thai title in 2008. Although he defended this belt numerous times and had an impressive 80% [[knockout]] ratio, he rarely fought outside him hometown of [[Munich]] or against top-ranked competition, and so was never considered elite at any weight class.<ref>[http://www.thmnews.com/wka-world-champion-besim-kabashi-tiger-muay-thai-training-highlight-reel.html Besim Kabashi]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nHe died from a heart attack in December 2011.\n\n==Early life==\nKabashi was born as the youngest of seven children to [[Kosovar Albanian]] parents near [[Istok]], [[Yugoslavia]] in 1976 and moved to Munich, Germany at the age of fourteen. He competed in athletics, football and swimming as a youngster before he began kickboxing when he was seventeen.<ref>[http://www.albanianboxing.com/legjendat/besim-kabashi.html Biografia e kikboksierit Besim Kabashi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010222034/http://www.albanianboxing.com/legjendat/besim-kabashi.html |date=October 10, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter successful careers in amateur boxing and kickboxing, Kabashi turned professional in 1997 and won the [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] German Light Heavyweight (-79&nbsp;kg/174&nbsp;lb) Championship in his debut year. He then followed this up by taking the WKA German Super Light Heavyweight (-83.2&nbsp;kg/183&nbsp;lb) title the following year. Despite a promising start to his career, Kabashi would then retire from the sport in 2002 following a disagreement with his trainer.\n\nHe returned to the ring in 2006, weighing in at 102&nbsp;kg/224&nbsp;lb. His transition to heavyweight saw him have success almost immediately as he [[Knockout|knocked out]] Zoran Dorcic in round two to become the WKA European Super Heavyweight (+95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Champion in 2007. He then won the WKA World Heavyweight (-95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Muay Thai belt on December 13, 2008 when he defeated Yahya G\u00fclay by fourth round [[technical knockout]]. Kabashi defended this title seven times over the next three years against the likes of [[David Dancrade]] and [[Petr Vondr\u00e1\u010dek]] before his untimely death in December 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.telajmi.com/lajmi/6888/besim-kabashi-mposht-petr-vondracek-me-ko-n-raundin-4.html |title=Besim Kabashi mposht Petr Vondracek me KO n\u00eb raundin 4 |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126011613/http://www.telajmi.com/lajmi/6888/besim-kabashi-mposht-petr-vondracek-me-ko-n-raundin-4.html |archive-date=2013-01-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nKabashi was found dead in his apartment in Munich, Germany on Sunday December 4, 2011.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/muenchen/muenchen/der-seltsame-tod-des-thai-boxers-kabashi-21413824.bild.html\n|title=Der seltsame Tod des Thai-Boxers\n|language=German\n|publisher=[[Bild]]\n|date= 2011-12-06\n|accessdate=2012-02-19\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/sport/Toter-Kickboxer-Raetsel-um-angeblichen-Abschiedsbrief-id17937481.html\n|title=Toter Kickboxer: R\u00e4tsel um angeblichen Abschiedsbrief\n|language=German\n|publisher=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]\n|date=2011-12-15\n|accessdate=2012-02-19\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213135647/http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/sport/Toter-Kickboxer-Raetsel-um-angeblichen-Abschiedsbrief-id17937481.html\n|archive-date=2012-02-13\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==Championships and awards==\n\n===Kickboxing===\n*'''[[World Kickboxing Association]]'''\n**WKA German Light Heavyweight (-79&nbsp;kg/174&nbsp;lb) Championship\n**WKA German Super Light Heavyweight (-83.2&nbsp;kg/183&nbsp;lb) Championship\n**WKA European Super Heavyweight (+95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Championship\n**WKA World Heavyweight (-95&nbsp;kg/209&nbsp;lb) Muay Thai Championship\n\n== Kickboxing record ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=100% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Many fighters and managers spoke out against FEG due to unpaid fight purses and objections to the direction that its owner was taking K-1.

It took place on May 27, 2012 at the Palacio Vistalegre in Madrid, Spain.\n\nAfter the event, controversy and rumors circulated over the fact that once again, fighters were not paid for their performances. Problems were compounded due to unpaid financial obligations of FEG, and the complete transfer of ownership of the K-1 name was not yet complete.

By 1998, K-1 introduced the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] format composed of  K-1 Regional Elimination Tournaments (theoretically amounting to six), which qualify fighters for the K-1 World Grand Prix Final, along with licensed K-1 Fighting Network events designed to hold national preliminaries for regional qualification. However, given the fact that K-1's popularity differs greatly among six K-1 regions, which may limit the number of actual elimination tournaments or change locations. For example, K-1 attempted to gain popularity in the United States by holding two GPs, however only a few Americans have ever qualified for the Finals. In 2006 one of the American GPs was relocated to [[Auckland]]. Additionally the K-1 [[Paris, France|Paris]] GP lost its qualifying right in favor of [[Amsterdam, Netherlands|Amsterdam]]. Eventually Amsterdam lost it in favor of [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], and then \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in favor of [[Bucharest, Romania|Bucharest]].\n\nK-1 World Grand Prix Final Eliminator (\"Final 16\") is an event where 16 participants compete for the final eight spots in the Final (\"Final 8\"). Eight participants from the Final Eliminator meet at the K-1 World Grand Prix Final. Lesser elements in the tournament format have been significantly modified in years. The final was held at [[Tokyo Dome]] from 1997 to 2006. The 2012 final took place for the first time in history outside Japan, in [[Zagreb, Croatia]].\n\n===K-1 World MAX and other===\nBy 2002, K-1 started the K-1 World MAX (\"Middleweight Artistic Xtreme\") tournament for 70&nbsp;kg (154&nbsp;lb) Middleweight division, following a similar scheme to K-1 World Grand Prix (with theoretically four regional eliminators). In 2007, K-1 introduced two new title belts separate from K-1 World GP Champions, Super Heavyweight World Title for fighters over 100&nbsp;kg/220&nbsp;lbs and Heavyweight World Title for fighters under 100&nbsp;kg/156\u2013220&nbsp;lbs.\n\n==Rules==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n*Each match is three or five rounds in duration, with each round lasting three minutes.\n*The match can end by Knockout, Technical Knockout, Decision, Disqualification, Draw or No Contest.\n*Both the referee and the ring doctor have full authority to stop the fight.\n*The fight is scored by three judges on a ten-point must system (The winner of each round receives ten points, and the loser receives nine or less. If the round is even, both competitors receive ten points).\n*If there is a draw after three rounds, the judges' scores are thrown out and one or two extra three-minute rounds are contested. The judges' decision will then come from the scoring of each extra round only. If, after the extra round(s), there is still a draw, the judges will decide a winner based on the flow of the entire match, considering even the slightest difference. A fight can only end in a draw if both fighters go down at the same time and cannot get up, or in the case of accidental injury in the late stages of the contest.\n*Three knockdowns in a round ends the contest, declared a [[technical knockout]].\n*The mandatory eight count is in effect (regardless when the fallen fighter rises, the referee must count to at least \"eight\" on all knockdowns).\n*The standing eight count is in effect (the referee has the right to declare a knockdown on a fighter who appears to be in a dangerous condition to continue in the match).\n*A fighter can be saved by the bell only in the last round.\n\nIn K-1 single elimination tournament matches:\n*Each match is three rounds in duration.\n*Except in the final, two knockdowns in a round ends the contest, declared a [[technical knockout]].\n*One or two reserve fights are held prior to the single elimination matches. If for any reason a fighter who wins and advances through the brackets is unable to continue, a reserve match competitor, or the fighter's opponent from the most recent match, takes his place. There are certain exceptions to this rule (i.e. a fighter who lost a match by knockout might not be eligible to replace another fighter).\n\n===Fouls===\nThe following actions in K-1 are considered fouls:<ref>[http://www.k-1.co.jp/en/what/rules.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809143241/http://www.k-1.co.jp/en/what/rules.html |date=August 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n*Using the head or elbow to deliver a blow\n*Attacking the opponent in the groin\n*Delivering wrestling or judo throwing or submission techniques\n*Thumbing, choking or biting the opponent\n*Punching the opponent in the throat\n*Attacking the opponent while he is down or in the process of getting up\n*Attacking the opponent after the referee calls a break\n*Holding the ropes\n*Using offensive language to the referee\n*Attacking the back of the head with a punch\n*Attempting to cause the opponent to fall out of the ring\n*Voluntarily exiting the ring during the course of a match\n*Attacking an opponent who turns around and shows his back (if the opponent loses his will to fight)\n*Delivering a backspin blow in an unauthorized area\n*Charging inside the opponent's arms with the head held low (inducing a head-butt)\n*Fighting in a passive manner (without attacking), including continuous holding and clinching\n*Attacking more than once while holding the opponent's kicking leg, or while holding the opponent's neck with both hands\n\nA fighter is penalized as follows:\n*Caution&nbsp;\u2013 verbal reprimand by the referee\n*Warning&nbsp;\u2013 fighter is shown a yellow card\n*Point Deduction&nbsp;\u2013 fighter is shown a red card\n\nTwo cautions result in one warning.

By 1998, K-1 introduced the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] format composed of  K-1 Regional Elimination Tournaments (theoretically amounting to six), which qualify fighters for the K-1 World Grand Prix Final, along with licensed K-1 Fighting Network events designed to hold national preliminaries for regional qualification. However, given the fact that K-1's popularity differs greatly among six K-1 regions, which may limit the number of actual elimination tournaments or change locations. For example, K-1 attempted to gain popularity in the United States by holding two GPs, however only a few Americans have ever qualified for the Finals. In 2006 one of the American GPs was relocated to [[Auckland]]. Additionally the K-1 [[Paris, France|Paris]] GP lost its qualifying right in favor of [[Amsterdam, Netherlands|Amsterdam]]. Eventually Amsterdam lost it in favor of [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], and then \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in favor of [[Bucharest, Romania|Bucharest]].\n\nK-1 World Grand Prix Final Eliminator (\"Final 16\") is an event where 16 participants compete for the final eight spots in the Final (\"Final 8\"). Eight participants from the Final Eliminator meet at the K-1 World Grand Prix Final. Lesser elements in the tournament format have been significantly modified in years. The final was held at [[Tokyo Dome]] from 1997 to 2006. The 2012 final took place for the first time in history outside Japan, in [[Zagreb, Croatia]].\n\n===K-1 World MAX and other===\nBy 2002, K-1 started the K-1 World MAX (\"Middleweight Artistic Xtreme\") tournament for 70&nbsp;kg (154&nbsp;lb) Middleweight division, following a similar scheme to K-1 World Grand Prix (with theoretically four regional eliminators). In 2007, K-1 introduced two new title belts separate from K-1 World GP Champions, Super Heavyweight World Title for fighters over 100&nbsp;kg/220&nbsp;lbs and Heavyweight World Title for fighters under 100&nbsp;kg/156\u2013220&nbsp;lbs.\n\n==Rules==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n*Each match is three or five rounds in duration, with each round lasting three minutes.\n*The match can end by Knockout, Technical Knockout, Decision, Disqualification, Draw or No Contest.\n*Both the referee and the ring doctor have full authority to stop the fight.\n*The fight is scored by three judges on a ten-point must system (The winner of each round receives ten points, and the loser receives nine or less. If the round is even, both competitors receive ten points).\n*If there is a draw after three rounds, the judges' scores are thrown out and one or two extra three-minute rounds are contested. The judges' decision will then come from the scoring of each extra round only. If, after the extra round(s), there is still a draw, the judges will decide a winner based on the flow of the entire match, considering even the slightest difference. A fight can only end in a draw if both fighters go down at the same time and cannot get up, or in the case of accidental injury in the late stages of the contest.\n*Three knockdowns in a round ends the contest, declared a [[technical knockout]].\n*The mandatory eight count is in effect (regardless when the fallen fighter rises, the referee must count to at least \"eight\" on all knockdowns).\n*The standing eight count is in effect (the referee has the right to declare a knockdown on a fighter who appears to be in a dangerous condition to continue in the match).\n*A fighter can be saved by the bell only in the last round.\n\nIn K-1 single elimination tournament matches:\n*Each match is three rounds in duration.\n*Except in the final, two knockdowns in a round ends the contest, declared a [[technical knockout]].\n*One or two reserve fights are held prior to the single elimination matches. If for any reason a fighter who wins and advances through the brackets is unable to continue, a reserve match competitor, or the fighter's opponent from the most recent match, takes his place. There are certain exceptions to this rule (i.e. a fighter who lost a match by knockout might not be eligible to replace another fighter).\n\n===Fouls===\nThe following actions in K-1 are considered fouls:<ref>[http://www.k-1.co.jp/en/what/rules.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809143241/http://www.k-1.co.jp/en/what/rules.html |date=August 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n*Using the head or elbow to deliver a blow\n*Attacking the opponent in the groin\n*Delivering wrestling or judo throwing or submission techniques\n*Thumbing, choking or biting the opponent\n*Punching the opponent in the throat\n*Attacking the opponent while he is down or in the process of getting up\n*Attacking the opponent after the referee calls a break\n*Holding the ropes\n*Using offensive language to the referee\n*Attacking the back of the head with a punch\n*Attempting to cause the opponent to fall out of the ring\n*Voluntarily exiting the ring during the course of a match\n*Attacking an opponent who turns around and shows his back (if the opponent loses his will to fight)\n*Delivering a backspin blow in an unauthorized area\n*Charging inside the opponent's arms with the head held low (inducing a head-butt)\n*Fighting in a passive manner (without attacking), including continuous holding and clinching\n*Attacking more than once while holding the opponent's kicking leg, or while holding the opponent's neck with both hands\n\nA fighter is penalized as follows:\n*Caution&nbsp;\u2013 verbal reprimand by the referee\n*Warning&nbsp;\u2013 fighter is shown a yellow card\n*Point Deduction&nbsp;\u2013 fighter is shown a red card\n\nTwo cautions result in one warning.

John H. Mather of the [[National Churchill Library and Center]] called into question Harris' veracity and offered the alternative theory of a \"left side brain tumour\". Mather noted that \"There is no indication that Lady Randolph or her sons were infected with syphilis.\"<ref name=\"maladiesetmort\">{{cite news|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/myths/144-lord-randolph-churchill-maladies-et-mort|title=Lord Randolph Churchill: Maladies et Mort|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===The \"Fourth Party\"===\n[[File:The Fourth Party Vanity Fair 1 December 1880.jpg|thumb|left|<center>\"The Fourth Party\" Spencer-Churchill, Balfour, Drummond-Wolff and Gorst as caricatured by Spy ([[Leslie Ward]]) in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1 December 1880</center>]]\nIt was not until 1878 that he came to public notice as the exponent of independent Conservatism. He made a series of furious attacks on [[Sir Stafford Northcote]], [[Richard Assheton Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R. A. Cross]], and other prominent members of the \"old gang\". [[George Sclater-Booth, 1st Baron Basing|George Sclater-Booth]] (afterwards 1st Baron Basing), [[President of the Local Government Board]], was a specific target, and the minister's County Government Bill was fiercely denounced as the \"crowning dishonour to Tory principles\", and the \"supreme violation of political honesty\".{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}} Lord Randolph's attitude, and the vituperative fluency of his invective, made him a parliamentary figure of some importance before the dissolution of the 1874 parliament, though he was not yet taken quite seriously, owing to his high-pitched hysterical laugh.<ref>Blake, pp. 134-35</ref>\n\nIn the new parliament of 1880 he speedily began to play a more notable role. Along with [[Henry Drummond Wolff]], [[John Eldon Gorst|John Gorst]] and occasionally [[Arthur Balfour]], he made himself known as the audacious opponent of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] administration and the unsparing critic of the Conservative front bench. The \"fourth party\", as it was nicknamed, at first did little damage to the government, but awakened the opposition from its apathy; Churchill roused the Conservatives by leading resistance to [[Charles Bradlaugh]], the member for [[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton]], who, an avowed atheist or agnostic, was prepared to take the parliamentary oath under protest. Stafford Northcote, the Conservative leader in the Lower House, was forced to take a strong line on this difficult question by the energy of the fourth party.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\nThe long controversy over Bradlaugh's seat showed that Lord Randolph Churchill was a parliamentary champion who added to his audacity much tactical skill and shrewdness. He continued to play a conspicuous part throughout the parliament of 1880\u201385, targeting [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as well as the Conservative front bench, some of whose members, particularly [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|Sir Richard Cross]] and [[William Henry Smith (1825\u20131891)|William Henry Smith]], he singled out for attack when they opposed the reduced Army estimates.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}} This would be the ostensible cause for his resignation because Salisbury failed to support his Chancellor in cabinet. They opposed his unionist politics of 'economising' by Tory tradition, making Randolph grow to hate cabinet meetings.<ref>W S Churchill, ''Life of Lord Randolph Churchill'', 2 vols, chap XIV<!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the [[History of Modern Egypt|Egyptian]] imbroglio Lord Randolph was emphatically opposed to almost every step taken by the government. He declared that the suppression of [[\u2018Urabi Revolt|Urabi Pasha's rebellion]] was an error, and the restoration of the [[khedive]]'s authority a crime. He called Gladstone the \"[[Moloch]] of [[Midlothian (UK Parliament constituency) (1708\u20131918)|Midlothian]]\", for whom torrents of blood had been shed in Africa. He was equally severe on the domestic policy of the administration, and was particularly bitter in his criticism of the [[Kilmainham Treaty]] and the rapprochement between the Gladstonians and the [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnellites]].{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===Tory Democracy===\n[[File:Randolph Churchill.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Lord Randolph Churchill]]\nBy 1885 he had formulated the policy of progressive Conservatism which was known as \"[[Tory Democracy]]\". He declared that the Conservatives ought to adopt, rather than oppose, popular reforms, and to challenge the claims of the Liberals to pose as champions of the masses. His views were largely accepted by the official Conservative leaders in the treatment of the Gladstonian [[Representation of the People Act 1884]]. Lord Randolph insisted that the principle of the bill should be accepted by the opposition, and that resistance should be focused on the refusal of the government to combine with it a scheme of redistribution. The prominent, and on the whole judicious and successful, part he played in the debates on these questions, still further increased his influence with the rank and file of the Conservatives in the constituencies.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\nAt the same time he was actively spreading his gospel of democratic Toryism in a series of platform campaigns. In 1883 and 1884 he went to the radical stronghold of [[Birmingham]], and in the latter year took part in a Conservative garden party at Aston Manor, at which his opponents paid him the compliment of raising a serious riot. He gave constant attention to the party organisation, which had fallen into considerable disorder after 1880, and was an active promoter of the [[Primrose League]], which owed its origin to the inspiration of one of his own \u201cfourth party\u201d colleagues.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===Central Office and National Union===\nIn 1884 progressive Toryism won out. At the conference of the [[National Union of Conservative Associations]], Lord Randolph was nominated chairman, despite the opposition of the parliamentary leaders.  A split was averted by Lord Randolph's voluntary resignation which he had done his best to engineer; but the episode had confirmed his title to a leading place in the Tory ranks.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}<ref>Blake, p. 145</ref>\n\nHe built up Tory Democracy in the towns reinforcing the urban middle classes part in the party, while simultaneously including a working-class element.  His unsuccessful bid for the party leadership was inextricably part of the National Union's attempt to control the party organization.<ref>Blake, p. 152</ref> It had originally been founded by Tory peers to organize propaganda to attract working men's votes, registration, choose candidates, conduct elections; associations were linked to provincial unions. Lord Randolph was not the originator but his campaign of 1884 encouraged the leadership to improve on their designs. For the first time since 1832 the Conservatives won in the majority of English boroughs in November 1885.<ref>R.R. James; Blake, pp. 152-53</ref>\n\nIt was strengthened by the prominent part he played in the events immediately preceding the fall of the Liberal government in 1885; and when [[Hugh Childers]]'s budget resolutions were defeated by the Conservatives, aided by about half the Parnellites, Lord Randolph Churchill's admirers were justified in proclaiming him to have been the \"organiser of victory\".{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===Secretary of State for India===\nIn Lord Salisbury's \"caretaker\" cabinet of 1885, Churchill was appointed [[Secretary of State for India]], assuming office on 24{{nbsp}}June 1885.<ref name=DIB>[[s:Dictionary of Indian Biography/Churchill, Lord Randolph Henry Spencer]]</ref> As the price of entry he demanded that Sir Stafford Northcote be removed from the Commons, despite being the Conservative leader there. Salisbury was more than willing to concede this, and Northcote went to the Lords as the Earl of Iddlesleigh.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nDespite entering office with a reputation for progressive views on India, Churchill 's tenure was, in the words of the historian and biographer R.F. Foster, 'traditionally reactionary', and many of his policies focused on exploiting, not developing India.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Foster |first1=R.F. |title=Lord Randolph Churchill: A Political Life |date=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=168}}</ref> He enthusiastically supported a trade policy which favoured British imports over Indian goods; increased spending on the Indian Army at the expense of public works such as railways, roads and irrigation (all sharply reduced under his secretaryship); and re-directed money which had been set aside for future famine relief to help balance his budget.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', pp. 189-190, 193-194</ref> His attitude towards the native Indians was similarly illiberal. He refused to allow reforms which would have increased Indian representation within the civil service and army, and, in a public speech at Birmingham, he infamously described a deputation to Britain by three Indian politicians, led by [[N. G. Chandavarkar]], as the 'three Bengalee baboos'.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', pp. 193, 204-205</ref> \n\nHowever, Churchill's most well-known act during his time at the India Office was his role in the invasion and annexation of Burma in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]].<ref>Kwarsi Kwarteng, ''Ghosts of Empire: Britain's Legacies in the Modern World'', Bloomsbury, 2011, Part III</ref> Siding with British commercial (especially cotton) and military interests, and hoping to boost Conservative fortunes in the upcoming general election, Churchill directed the [[Viceroy]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], to invade [[Upper Burma]] in November 1885.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', pp. 206-213</ref> With little discussion, Churchill then decided to annex the Burmese kingdom, adding it as a new province of the Indian [[British Raj|Raj]] as a \"New Year present\" for [[Queen Victoria]] on New Year's Day 1886. Not only is the war itself widely regarded as a piece of blatant [[imperialism]], but the continuing guerrilla war lasted into the later 1880s and cost the Indian taxpayer ten times Churchill's original financial estimates.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', p. 209</ref> \n\nIn the autumn election of 1885 he contested [[Birmingham Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Central]] against [[John Bright]], and though defeated here, was at the same time returned by a very large majority for [[Paddington South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Paddington]].{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\nIn the contest which arose over [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s [[First Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule]] bill, Lord Randolph again bore a conspicuous part, and in the electioneering campaign his activity was only second to that of some of the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]], [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]], [[George Joachim Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen|George Goschen]] and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. He was now the recognised Conservative champion in the Lower Chamber, and when the second Salisbury administration was formed after the general election of 1886 he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===End of political career===\n[[File:Edward Linley Sambourne - Lord Randolph Churchill, 1881.png|thumb|upright|1881 [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] cartoon by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]] of Lord Randolph Churchill, M.P., as a \"midge with no sting in Parliament.\"]]\n\nChurchill was new to the leadership ranks, and became a relatively isolated figure in the cabinet. He did not think in terms of consulting his supporters and building a base in Commons; instead, he decided to use his strong public support to impose his positions on Prime Minister Lord Salisbury in both domestic and foreign affairs. He decided to demonstrate to the public that the Conservatives could be as economical in budgetary matters as Gladstone had been. Therefore, he proposed a budget with significant slashes that surprised and annoyed the Conservative MPs. They were willing to compromise, but he insisted on additional cuts in the Army and Navy that alarmed the service ministers. Churchill decided to threaten resignation\u2014it proved one of the great blunders in British political history. In his resignation letter he stated that it was because he was unable as Chancellor to support the service. He expected his resignation to be followed by the unconditional surrender of the cabinet, and his restoration to office on his own terms. Instead, Salisbury accepted the resignation, and Churchill was out in the cold. Goschen replaced him as Chancellor.<ref>Norman McCord and Bill Purdue, ''British History, 1815-1914'' (2nd ed. 2007) pp 410-11,.</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Eric Alexander |title=Chief Whip |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NP7lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT88 |year=1961 |pages=86\u201389 |isbn=9781442654655}}</ref> For the next few years there was some speculation about a return to front-line politics, but Churchill's own career was over.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=347}} Even so, his economising ideas survived yet in the \"Dartford Programme\" of September 1886.\n\nAlthough Lord Randolph continued to sit in Parliament, his health was in serious decline throughout the 1890s. He was an ardent patron of horse-racing and in 1889, his horse [[L'Abbesse de Jouarre]] won [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]]. In 1891 he went to South Africa, in search both of health and relaxation. He travelled for some months through [[Cape Colony]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matjiesfontein.com/About/index.htm |title=Matjiesfontein History - Matjiesfontein |website=matjiesfontein.com |accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref> the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Rhodesia]], making notes on the politics and economics of the countries, shooting lions, and recording his impressions in letters to a London newspaper, which were afterwards republished under the title of ''Men, Mines and Animals in South Africa''. He attacked [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s [[Second Irish Home Rule Bill|Second Home Rule Bill]] with energy,{{sfn|Low|1911|p=347}} and gave fiery pro-Union speeches in Ireland.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} During this time he coined the phrase \"Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right\", echoing his earlier remark that in opposing Irish Home Rule \"the Orange card would be the one to play\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Paul Bew |title=Churchill and Ireland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzrcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT55 |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=55\u201356 |isbn=9780191071492}}</ref>\n\nIt was soon apparent that Churchill's powers had been undermined by the illness which was to take his life at the age of 45. As the session of 1893 wore on, his speeches lost their old effectiveness. His last speech in the House was delivered in the debate on the East African Scheme in June 1894, and was a painful failure.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=347}}\n\n==Death==\nAn attempted round-the-world journey failed to cure Lord Randolph of his debilitating illness. He started in the autumn of 1894, accompanied by his wife, but his health soon became so feeble that he was brought back hurriedly from Cairo. He reached England shortly before Christmas, and died in [[Westminster]].{{sfn|Low|1911|p=347}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=cnS1ua%2FEVI2BXjrLIgIY7Q&scan=1 |title=Index entry |access-date=24 April 2018 |work=[[FreeBMD]] |publisher=ONS}}</ref> The gross value of his personal estate was entered in the Probate Registry at \u00a375,971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E5DF133DE433A25756C0A9659C94649ED7CF |title=RANDOLPH CHURCHILL'S WILL; Details of the Estate Bequeathed to His Wife and Children |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 March 1895 |page=5 |access-date=25 July 2019 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222031341/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E5DF133DE433A25756C0A9659C94649ED7CF |archive-date=22 February 2009}}</ref> This is the financial equivalent of over \u00a38.34 million in 2018 terms, using the retail price index.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&use%5B%5D=NOMINALEARN&year_early=1894&pound71=76&shilling71=&pence71=&amount=76&year_source=1894&year_result=2010r |work=Measuring Worth \u2013 Measures of worth, inflation rates, saving calculator, relative value, worth of a dollar, worth of a pound, purchasing power, gold prices, GDP... |access-date=16 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610220910/http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&use%5B%5D=NOMINALEARN&year_early=1894&pound71=76&shilling71=&pence71=&amount=76&year_source=1894&year_result=2010r |archive-date=10 June 2015 |title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1245 to Present |first=Lawrence H. |last=Officer |first2=Samuel H. |last2=Williamson |year=2012}}</ref> He is buried near his wife and sons at [[St Martin's Church, Bladon]], near [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire]].\n\nHis widow, Lady Randolph Churchill, married [[George Cornwallis-West]] in 1900, when she became known as Mrs. George Cornwallis-West.  After that marriage was dissolved, she resumed by [[deed poll]] her prior married name, Lady Randolph Churchill. (Lord Randolph was her husband's courtesy title as the younger son of a duke and in English law does not qualify as a noble title in its own right.) Lord Randolph's son, Sir [[Winston Churchill]], died on 24 January 1965, aged 90, exactly 70 years after the death of his father, having lived twice as long.\n\n==Personality and reputation==\nRosebery described his old friend and political opponent, after his death, thus: \"his nervous system was always tense and highly strung; ...he seems to have had no knowledge  of men, no consideration of their feelings, no give and take.\"  But he continued, \"in congenial society, his conversation was wholly delightful. He would then display his mastery of pleasant irony and banter; for with those playthings he was at his best.\"<ref>Gertrude Atherton, ''Review: Lord Randolph Churchill'', Reviewed Work: Lord Randolph Churchill by Lord Rosebery, The North American Review Vol. 184, No. 606 (Jan. 4, 1907), pp. 87\u201391, at p. 90.

He had a gift for mordant, wounding, sometimes very funny phrases. And, having thought up the most outrageous attack he had the nerve to deliver it, without fear of offending taste or friends or damaging his own repute....He was strong on insolence. He also had other attributes necessary to make his words resound, and his fame increase: a mnemonic name, an  idiosyncratic appearance, and good delivery, whether on the platform or in the House of Commons. In addition he had sporadic charm, although intermingled with offensive and often pointless rudeness.<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''The Chancellors'' (1998), pp. 11-12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJenkins compares his youth to that of [[William Pitt the Younger]]: \"Pitt was Prime Minister for 19 of his 46 years.

His downfall is represented when he confronts [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]] and demands she use her influence with the Prince to stop [[Lord Aylesford]] proceeding with a divorce from his wife, Lady Aylesford, after she had planned to elope with Lord Randolph's elder brother, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough|Marquess of Blandford]]. He threatens to expose letters from the Prince to Lady Aylesford, so scandalous, so he says, that if they were to be exposed, \"the Prince of Wales would never sit on the throne of England.\"\n\nOutraged, the Princess goes to see the [[Queen Victoria|Queen]], who is equally indignant. Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] informs the Prince, who is so angry that he challenges Lord Randolph to a [[duel]] in the [[South of France]]. Eventually, Lord Aylesford does not attempt to seek a divorce from his wife, and Lord Blandford does not elope with Lady Aylesford. Lord Randolph sends a note of apology to the Prince, which is merely acknowledged. Disgraced, Lord Randolph and his wife leave for America.\n\nOther notable appearances include the film ''[[Young Winston]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]], and the miniseries ''[[Jennie, The Life of Lady Randolph Churchill]]'', in which he was portrayed by actor [[Ronald Pickup]], as the English aristocrat who falls in love with the daughter of an American billionaire property developer.\n\nSir Winston referred to his father's career in several of the last chapters of ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'' written in Winston's 'wilderness years' in the inter-war years before he was recalled to the cabinet.\n\n===Fiction===\n* The alternate history novel ''Fight and Be Right'' (by Ed Thomas), traces Churchill's further political rise in a world where his brother, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough|Marquess of Blandford]], loses the scandalous letter between the Prince of Wales and Lady Aylesford, resulting in their father, the [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], not being promoted to Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Randolph free of the scandal from the affair to rise further through the party ranks and become Prime Minister.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[List of Freemasons|Notable Freemasons]]\n* [[Edward the Seventh]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Primary sources===\n*{{cite book |first=Lady Victoria |last=Beach |title=The Life of Sir Michael Hicks Beach |volume=2 vols |date=1932}}\n*{{cite book |first=Peregrine |last=Churchill |first2=Julian |last2=Mitchell |authorlink2=Julian Mitchell |title=Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill |url=https://archive.org/details/jennieladyrandol00chur |url-access=registration |date=1974|publisher=New York, St. Martin's Press }}\n*{{cite book |author=[[Winston Churchill]] |title=Lord Randolph Churchill |publisher=Odhams Press |place=London |date=1905 |title-link=Lord Randolph Churchill (book)}}\n** Volume I [https://archive.org/details/lordrandolphchu01unkngoog Full text] at [[Archive.org]]\n** Volume II [https://archive.org/details/lordrandolphchu00unkngoog Full text] at Archive.org\n*{{cite book |first=Randolph S. |last=Churchill |authorlink=Randolph Churchill |title=Winston S.

Party, and broke new ground in modern budgetary presentations, attracting admiration and criticism from across the political spectrum. His most acerbic critics were in his own party, among his closest friends; but his disloyalty to [[Lord Salisbury]] was the beginning of the end of what should have been a glittering career.  His elder son, [[Winston Churchill|Winston]], wrote a biography of him in 1906.<ref>Churchill, Winston C. 1906.

At Oxford, Primrose \u2013 now with his own courtesy title of ''Lord Dalmeny'' \u2013 was along with Churchill a member of the [[Bullingdon Club]], and joined him at the Club's champagne-fuelled parties.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[Frank Harris]], ''[[My Life and Loves]]'', 1922\u201327; p. 483</ref> Randolph was frequently in trouble with the university authorities for drunkenness, smoking in academic dress, and smashing windows at the [[Randolph Hotel, Oxford|Randolph Hotel]]. His rowdy behaviour was infectious, rubbing off on friends and contemporaries; he gained a reputation as an ''[[enfant terrible]]''.<ref>[[Leo McKinstry]], ''Rosebery: Statesman in Turmoil'', pp. 23, 33</ref> He had a liking for hunting, but was also a well-read historian.

His behaviour was, however, the later cause of dissension in his relations with a colder, more aloof, disciplinarian [[Lord Salisbury|Salisbury]]. In 1871 Churchill and his elder brother [[George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough|George]] were initiated into the rites of [[Freemasonry]], as later his son Winston would be.<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchill |first=Randolph |title=Masonic Papers |url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/freemasonry_england.html |work=The Development of the Craft in England |publisher=freemasons-freemasonary.com |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the general election of 1874 Churchill was elected to Parliament as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]], near the family seat, defeating [[George Charles Brodrick|George Brodrick]], a Fellow of Merton. His [[maiden speech]], delivered in his first session, prompted compliments from [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who wrote to the Queen of Churchill's \"energy and natural flow\".<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nChurchill was a close friend of [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild]], and received \"extensive loans\" from the Rothschilds. He reported on the mining industry in South Africa on their behalf, where their agent [[Cecil Rhodes]] was consolidating mining deposits which ultimately led to the creation of [[De Beers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rothschildarchive.org/business/rothschild_clients |title=The Rothschild Archive |website=rothschildarchive.org |accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and medical condition==\n[[File:Lord Randolph Churchill and Lady Jennie Jerome (1874) (A).jpg|thumb|right|upright=|Lord Randolph Churchill and [[Lady Randolph Churchill]] (Jennie Jerome) in [[Paris]] (1874) by [[Georges Penabert]]]]\n\nLord Randolph Churchill was married at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|British Embassy in Paris]] on 15 April 1874 to [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Jerome]], daughter of [[Leonard Jerome]], an American businessman.<ref>Anita Leslie.

He made a series of furious attacks on [[Sir Stafford Northcote]], [[Richard Assheton Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R. A. Cross]], and other prominent members of the \"old gang\". [[George Sclater-Booth, 1st Baron Basing|George Sclater-Booth]] (afterwards 1st Baron Basing), [[President of the Local Government Board]], was a specific target, and the minister's County Government Bill was fiercely denounced as the \"crowning dishonour to Tory principles\", and the \"supreme violation of political honesty\".{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}} Lord Randolph's attitude, and the vituperative fluency of his invective, made him a parliamentary figure of some importance before the dissolution of the 1874 parliament, though he was not yet taken quite seriously, owing to his high-pitched hysterical laugh.<ref>Blake, pp. 134-35</ref>\n\nIn the new parliament of 1880 he speedily began to play a more notable role. Along with [[Henry Drummond Wolff]], [[John Eldon Gorst|John Gorst]] and occasionally [[Arthur Balfour]], he made himself known as the audacious opponent of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] administration and the unsparing critic of the Conservative front bench. The \"fourth party\", as it was nicknamed, at first did little damage to the government, but awakened the opposition from its apathy; Churchill roused the Conservatives by leading resistance to [[Charles Bradlaugh]], the member for [[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton]], who, an avowed atheist or agnostic, was prepared to take the parliamentary oath under protest. Stafford Northcote, the Conservative leader in the Lower House, was forced to take a strong line on this difficult question by the energy of the fourth party.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\nThe long controversy over Bradlaugh's seat showed that Lord Randolph Churchill was a parliamentary champion who added to his audacity much tactical skill and shrewdness. He continued to play a conspicuous part throughout the parliament of 1880\u201385, targeting [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as well as the Conservative front bench, some of whose members, particularly [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|Sir Richard Cross]] and [[William Henry Smith (1825\u20131891)|William Henry Smith]], he singled out for attack when they opposed the reduced Army estimates.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}} This would be the ostensible cause for his resignation because Salisbury failed to support his Chancellor in cabinet. They opposed his unionist politics of 'economising' by Tory tradition, making Randolph grow to hate cabinet meetings.<ref>W S Churchill, ''Life of Lord Randolph Churchill'', 2 vols, chap XIV<!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the [[History of Modern Egypt|Egyptian]] imbroglio Lord Randolph was emphatically opposed to almost every step taken by the government. He declared that the suppression of [[\u2018Urabi Revolt|Urabi Pasha's rebellion]] was an error, and the restoration of the [[khedive]]'s authority a crime. He called Gladstone the \"[[Moloch]] of [[Midlothian (UK Parliament constituency) (1708\u20131918)|Midlothian]]\", for whom torrents of blood had been shed in Africa. He was equally severe on the domestic policy of the administration, and was particularly bitter in his criticism of the [[Kilmainham Treaty]] and the rapprochement between the Gladstonians and the [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnellites]].{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===Tory Democracy===\n[[File:Randolph Churchill.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Lord Randolph Churchill]]\nBy 1885 he had formulated the policy of progressive Conservatism which was known as \"[[Tory Democracy]]\". He declared that the Conservatives ought to adopt, rather than oppose, popular reforms, and to challenge the claims of the Liberals to pose as champions of the masses. His views were largely accepted by the official Conservative leaders in the treatment of the Gladstonian [[Representation of the People Act 1884]]. Lord Randolph insisted that the principle of the bill should be accepted by the opposition, and that resistance should be focused on the refusal of the government to combine with it a scheme of redistribution. The prominent, and on the whole judicious and successful, part he played in the debates on these questions, still further increased his influence with the rank and file of the Conservatives in the constituencies.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\nAt the same time he was actively spreading his gospel of democratic Toryism in a series of platform campaigns. In 1883 and 1884 he went to the radical stronghold of [[Birmingham]], and in the latter year took part in a Conservative garden party at Aston Manor, at which his opponents paid him the compliment of raising a serious riot. He gave constant attention to the party organisation, which had fallen into considerable disorder after 1880, and was an active promoter of the [[Primrose League]], which owed its origin to the inspiration of one of his own \u201cfourth party\u201d colleagues.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===Central Office and National Union===\nIn 1884 progressive Toryism won out. At the conference of the [[National Union of Conservative Associations]], Lord Randolph was nominated chairman, despite the opposition of the parliamentary leaders.  A split was averted by Lord Randolph's voluntary resignation which he had done his best to engineer; but the episode had confirmed his title to a leading place in the Tory ranks.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}<ref>Blake, p. 145</ref>\n\nHe built up Tory Democracy in the towns reinforcing the urban middle classes part in the party, while simultaneously including a working-class element.  His unsuccessful bid for the party leadership was inextricably part of the National Union's attempt to control the party organization.<ref>Blake, p. 152</ref> It had originally been founded by Tory peers to organize propaganda to attract working men's votes, registration, choose candidates, conduct elections; associations were linked to provincial unions. Lord Randolph was not the originator but his campaign of 1884 encouraged the leadership to improve on their designs. For the first time since 1832 the Conservatives won in the majority of English boroughs in November 1885.<ref>R.R. James; Blake, pp. 152-53</ref>\n\nIt was strengthened by the prominent part he played in the events immediately preceding the fall of the Liberal government in 1885; and when [[Hugh Childers]]'s budget resolutions were defeated by the Conservatives, aided by about half the Parnellites, Lord Randolph Churchill's admirers were justified in proclaiming him to have been the \"organiser of victory\".{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===Secretary of State for India===\nIn Lord Salisbury's \"caretaker\" cabinet of 1885, Churchill was appointed [[Secretary of State for India]], assuming office on 24{{nbsp}}June 1885.<ref name=DIB>[[s:Dictionary of Indian Biography/Churchill, Lord Randolph Henry Spencer]]</ref> As the price of entry he demanded that Sir Stafford Northcote be removed from the Commons, despite being the Conservative leader there. Salisbury was more than willing to concede this, and Northcote went to the Lords as the Earl of Iddlesleigh.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nDespite entering office with a reputation for progressive views on India, Churchill 's tenure was, in the words of the historian and biographer R.F. Foster, 'traditionally reactionary'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Foster |first1=R.F. |title=Lord Randolph Churchill: A Political Life |date=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=168}}</ref> He enthusiastically supported a free trade policy which favoured British imports over Indian goods. He increased spending on the Indian Army at the expense of public works such as railways, roads and irrigation, which were all sharply reduced under his secretaryship, while also re-directing money which had been set aside for future famine relief.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', pp. 189-190, 193-194</ref> His attitude towards the native Indians was similarly illiberal. He refused to allow reforms which would have increased Indian representation within the civil service and army, and, in a public speech at Birmingham, he famously described a deputation to Britain by three Indian politicians, led by [[N. G. Chandavarkar]], as the 'three Bengalee baboos'.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', pp. 193, 204-205</ref> \n\nHowever, Churchill's most famous act during his tenure at the India Office was the invasion and annexation of Burma in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]]. Siding with British commercial (especially cotton) and military interests, and hoping to boost Conservative fortunes in the upcoming general election, Churchill directed the [[Viceroy]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], to invade [[Upper Burma]] in November 1885.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', pp. 206-213</ref> With little discussion, Churchill then decided to annex the final remnant of the once great Burmese kingdom, adding it as a new province of the Indian [[British Raj|Raj]] as a \"New Year present\" for [[Queen Victoria]] on New Year's Day 1886. Not only is the war itself widely regarded as an unnecessary piece of blatant [[imperialism]], but the continuing guerrilla war lasted into the later 1880s and cost the Indian taxpayer ten times Churchill's original estimates.<ref>Foster, ''Randolph Churchill'', p. 209</ref> <ref>Kwarsi Kwarteng, ''Ghosts of Empire: Britain's Legacies in the Modern World'', Bloomsbury, 2011, Part III</ref>\n\nIn the autumn election of 1885 he contested [[Birmingham Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Central]] against [[John Bright]], and though defeated here, was at the same time returned by a very large majority for [[Paddington South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Paddington]].{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\nIn the contest which arose over [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s [[First Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule]] bill, Lord Randolph again bore a conspicuous part, and in the electioneering campaign his activity was only second to that of some of the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]], [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]], [[George Joachim Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen|George Goschen]] and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. He was now the recognised Conservative champion in the Lower Chamber, and when the second Salisbury administration was formed after the general election of 1886 he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Low|1911|p=346}}\n\n===End of political career===\n[[File:Edward Linley Sambourne - Lord Randolph Churchill, 1881.png|thumb|upright|1881 [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] cartoon by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]] of Lord Randolph Churchill, M.P., as a \"midge with no sting in Parliament.\"]]\n\nChurchill was new to the leadership ranks, and became a relatively isolated figure in the cabinet. He did not think in terms of consulting his supporters and building a base in Commons; instead, he decided to use his strong public support to impose his positions on Prime Minister Lord Salisbury in both domestic and foreign affairs. He decided to demonstrate to the public that the Conservatives could be as economical in budgetary matters as Gladstone had been. Therefore, he proposed a budget with significant slashes that surprised and annoyed the Conservative MPs. They were willing to compromise, but he insisted on additional cuts in the Army and Navy that alarmed the service ministers. Churchill decided to threaten resignation\u2014it proved one of the great blunders in British political history. In his resignation letter he stated that it was because he was unable as Chancellor to support the service. He expected his resignation to be followed by the unconditional surrender of the cabinet, and his restoration to office on his own terms. Instead, Salisbury accepted the resignation, and Churchill was out in the cold. Goschen replaced him as Chancellor.<ref>Norman McCord and Bill Purdue, ''British History, 1815-1914'' (2nd ed. 2007) pp 410-11,.</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Eric Alexander |title=Chief Whip |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NP7lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT88 |year=1961 |pages=86\u201389 |isbn=9781442654655}}</ref> For the next few years there was some speculation about a return to front-line politics, but Churchill's own career was over.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=347}} Even so, his economising ideas survived yet in the \"Dartford Programme\" of September 1886.\n\nAlthough Lord Randolph continued to sit in Parliament, his health was in serious decline throughout the 1890s. He was an ardent patron of horse-racing and in 1889, his horse [[L'Abbesse de Jouarre]] won [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]]. In 1891 he went to South Africa, in search both of health and relaxation. He travelled for some months through [[Cape Colony]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matjiesfontein.com/About/index.htm |title=Matjiesfontein History - Matjiesfontein |website=matjiesfontein.com |accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref> the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Rhodesia]], making notes on the politics and economics of the countries, shooting lions, and recording his impressions in letters to a London newspaper, which were afterwards republished under the title of ''Men, Mines and Animals in South Africa''. He attacked [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s [[Second Irish Home Rule Bill|Second Home Rule Bill]] with energy,{{sfn|Low|1911|p=347}} and gave fiery pro-Union speeches in Ireland.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} During this time he coined the phrase \"Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right\", echoing his earlier remark that in opposing Irish Home Rule \"the Orange card would be the one to play\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Paul Bew |title=Churchill and Ireland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzrcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT55 |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=55\u201356 |isbn=9780191071492}}</ref>\n\nIt was soon apparent that Churchill's powers had been undermined by the illness which was to take his life at the age of 45. As the session of 1893 wore on, his speeches lost their old effectiveness. His last speech in the House was delivered in the debate on the East African Scheme in June 1894, and was a painful failure.{{sfn|Low|1911|p=347}}\n\n==Death==\nAn attempted round-the-world journey failed to cure Lord Randolph of his debilitating illness. He started in the autumn of 1894, accompanied by his wife, but his health soon became so feeble that he was brought back hurriedly from Cairo.

He had a gift for mordant, wounding, sometimes very funny phrases. And, having thought up the most outrageous attack he had the nerve to deliver it, without fear of offending taste or friends or damaging his own repute....He was strong on insolence. He also had other attributes necessary to make his words resound, and his fame increase: a mnemonic name, an  idiosyncratic appearance, and good delivery, whether on the platform or in the House of Commons. In addition he had sporadic charm, although intermingled with offensive and often pointless rudeness.<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''The Chancellors'' (1998), pp. 11-12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJenkins compares his youth to that of [[William Pitt the Younger]]: \"Pitt was Prime Minister for 19 of his 46 years.

His downfall is represented when he confronts [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]] and demands she use her influence with the Prince to stop [[Lord Aylesford]] proceeding with a divorce from his wife, Lady Aylesford, after she had planned to elope with Lord Randolph's elder brother, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough|Marquess of Blandford]]. He threatens to expose letters from the Prince to Lady Aylesford, so scandalous, so he says, that if they were to be exposed, \"the Prince of Wales would never sit on the throne of England.\"\n\nOutraged, the Princess goes to see the [[Queen Victoria|Queen]], who is equally indignant. Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] informs the Prince, who is so angry that he challenges Lord Randolph to a [[duel]] in the [[South of France]]. Eventually, Lord Aylesford does not attempt to seek a divorce from his wife, and Lord Blandford does not elope with Lady Aylesford. Lord Randolph sends a note of apology to the Prince, which is merely acknowledged. Disgraced, Lord Randolph and his wife leave for America.\n\nOther notable appearances include the film ''[[Young Winston]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]], and the miniseries ''[[Jennie, The Life of Lady Randolph Churchill]]'', in which he was portrayed by actor [[Ronald Pickup]], as the English aristocrat who falls in love with the daughter of an American billionaire property developer.\n\nSir Winston referred to his father's career in several of the last chapters of ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'' written in Winston's 'wilderness years' in the inter-war years before he was recalled to the cabinet.\n\n===Fiction===\n* The alternate history novel ''Fight and Be Right'' (by Ed Thomas), traces Churchill's further political rise in a world where his brother, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 8th Duke of Marlborough|Marquess of Blandford]], loses the scandalous letter between the Prince of Wales and Lady Aylesford, resulting in their father, the [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], not being promoted to Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Randolph free of the scandal from the affair to rise further through the party ranks and become Prime Minister.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[List of Freemasons|Notable Freemasons]]\n* [[Edward the Seventh]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Primary sources===\n*{{cite book |first=Lady Victoria |last=Beach |title=The Life of Sir Michael Hicks Beach |volume=2 vols |date=1932}}\n*{{cite book |first=Peregrine |last=Churchill |first2=Julian |last2=Mitchell |authorlink2=Julian Mitchell |title=Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill |url=https://archive.org/details/jennieladyrandol00chur |url-access=registration |date=1974|publisher=New York, St. Martin's Press }}\n*{{cite book |author=[[Winston Churchill]] |title=Lord Randolph Churchill |publisher=Odhams Press |place=London |date=1905 |title-link=Lord Randolph Churchill (book)}}\n** Volume I [https://archive.org/details/lordrandolphchu01unkngoog Full text] at [[Archive.org]]\n** Volume II [https://archive.org/details/lordrandolphchu00unkngoog Full text] at Archive.org\n*{{cite book |first=Randolph S. |last=Churchill |authorlink=Randolph Churchill |title=Winston S.

A console port published by [[Rooster Teeth Games]] was released on November 20, 2018. On December 21, 2018, a mobile port was released for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The sequel, ''[[Bendy and the Dark Revival]]'' is in development.\n\nThe game follows Henry Stein, a retired [[animator]] who returns to his old animation studio Joey Drew Studios from the 1930s after an invitation from his old employer Joey Drew, and discovers a nightmare of cartoon characters seemingly brought to life by the titular Ink Machine.\n\n''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' was well-received upon its initial release, with praise centering on its vintage aesthetic and story. In the months following its release, it quickly gained a massive following from exposure on platforms like [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and eventually was approved through [[Steam Greenlight]] in mid-2017. Merchandise, as well as a mobile spin-off, was later introduced to further promote the game. Mike Mood, the game's programmer and co-creator, described the game as an \"accidental success\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TylerMcAuleyVallier/20170711/301391/The_CoCreater_of_Bendy_and_the_Ink_Machine_Talks_Accidental_Success.php|title=The Co-Creator of Bendy and the Ink Machine Talks Accidental Success|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' is a [[survival horror]] game that features a mixture of puzzle solving, environment exploration and combat to aid Henry on his journey through the darkened halls of Joey Drew Studios. Players explore through a first-person view and have limited physical actions such as running and jumping. Different items can be collected, some of which are required to perform various tasks before proceeding. Cans of [[bacon soup]], a reference to the game's creator theMeatly and his partner Mike Mood, can also be collected for achievements and to restore Henry's [[Health (gaming)|health]] if he is injured.\n\nCombat is primarily focused around a variety of different melee-based weapons, such as an [[axe]], [[piping|pipe]], [[plunger]], or [[scythe]]. There are also long-range weapons such as a [[tommy gun]] or bacon soup cans. In-game enemies all have different strength levels and resilience to damage, forcing players to be tactical about keeping out of reach and striking when necessary. Failure to do so will result in a death. Henry can retreat inside Little Miracle Stations whenever enemies are nearby in order to recover or remain out of sight. If he takes too much damage, he can escape from the ink that consumes him and [[respawn]] at one of the numerous statues of Bendy that act as [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoints]].\n\nIn addition, players can find numerous audio logs throughout the studio that give more details about the game's story, particularly concerning the fate of the studio and its employees, similar to the systems used in games such as ''[[BioShock]]''. Some of these logs can be missed and require further exploration to uncover the secret areas they often reside In.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nAugust 1963, retired animator Henry Stein receives a letter from his former employer and boss, Joey Drew, asking him to return to Joey's [[animation studio]] and see something important. He visits the studio and finds it abandoned, but discovers an \"ink machine\", installed sometime after Henry's departure 30 years earlier. He finds a tape recording that suggests Joey engaged in bizarre occult practices while making the machine, as well as a mutilated real-life analogue of Boris the Wolf, one of the studio's cartoon characters. Once Henry fixes and starts the machine, he is attacked by a creature known as \"Ink Bendy\" that looks like an evil version of the studio's mascot Bendy. As the studio begins to fill with ink, Henry flees toward an exit, only for the floor to collapse and drop him into the studio's lower levels. Draining the ink from several rooms, he finds a chamber whose floor is marked with strange diagrams. He hallucinates seeing the ink machine, a wheelchair and then Ink Bendy before passing out.\n\nHenry wakes up and begins to search for a way out, eventually reaching the studio's music department. Henry finds a stairwell leading to the exit, but the entrance is overflowing with ink. While looking for a way to drain it, he is attacked by a gang of ink creatures known as the Searchers; once they are defeated, Henry enters the office of Sammy Lawrence, the studio's musical director. After completing several tasks to drain the ink, Henry hurries toward the exit but is attacked by Sammy, whose body has been transformed into ink. Sammy intends to sacrifice Henry to Ink Bendy in order to regain his humanity, but before he can do so, he is dragged away by Ink Bendy and presumably killed. Henry frees himself and flees through the studio, pursued by Ink Bendy. Barricading himself behind a door, he waits until Ink Bendy has moved on and then comes to face to face with a living, intact Boris, called Buddy Boris.\n\nHenry befriends Buddy Boris, and the two leave the latter's improvised [[safehouse]] to continue searching for an exit. In the studio's toy department, they find another ink creature called Alice Angel, who is a distorted version of the good character Alice Angel. Alice leads them to her lair and reveals that she has been harvesting the ink of other characters in an effort to keep herself beautiful. Henry must perform several tasks for Alice in order for her to let him and Buddy Boris go free, learning from tape recordings that Alice's original voice actress, Susie Campbell became bitter when Joey suddenly hired a replacement for her. It is implied that the ink transformed this actress into Alice Angel. As Henry carries out Alice's tasks, he must hide from both Ink Bendy and the Projectionist, an entity of projector operator Norman Polk. Henry completes the tasks and boards a lift to escape with Buddy Boris, but Alice forces it to crash to the bottom of its shaft and suddenly pulls Buddy Boris into the darkness, proclaiming that she wants to use him to fix herself.\n\nClimbing out of the crashed lift, Henry ventures deeper into the studio in search of Buddy Boris and finds a lounge filled with the Lost Ones, ink creatures who show no hostility. He also discovers that Joey had been planning to open a Bendy-themed [[amusement park]] with the help of famed ride designer Bertrum Piedmont. Henry enters a large warehouse filled with rides, games, and props from the planned park. In order to reach Buddy Boris, Henry must restore power to the haunted house attraction by finding and flipping a series of switches, one of which is guarded by a ride merged with the remains of a revenge-driven Bertrum. After flipping the last switch, Henry is chased by the Projectionist, who is in turn ambushed by Ink Bendy and killed. Ink Bendy notices Henry but leaves him alone, and Henry enters the haunted house only to find that Alice has turned Buddy Boris into a hulking beast named Brute Boris. Henry is forced to kill him in self-defense. Alice then tries to kill Henry herself in a rage but is killed with a sword from behind. The wielder is Allison Angel, a physically intact and sane duplicate of Alice Angel. She is accompanied by Tom, a wolf character similar to Boris.\n\nAllison Angel and Tom hold Henry captive, but he eventually gains Allison's trust and she gives him a \"seeing tool\" that allows him to see hidden messages on the walls. After Tom inadvertently reveals the location of their hideout to Ink Bendy, he and Allison abandon Henry and flee. Henry escapes on his own and crosses a river of ink on a paddleboat, reaching a shantytown built by the Lost Ones. There, Henry is attacked by Sammy, shown to have survived his encounter with Ink Bendy at the end of Chapter 2 and blaming Henry for Ink Bendy's decision to abandon him. Unmasked by Henry, Sammy gains the upper hand and tries to kill him, only to be killed by Tom instead. After Tom gains Henry's trust, Tom and Allison aid Henry in fighting off the Searchers and Lost Ones, revealed to have been only kept in check by Sammy, and Henry falls into the administration offices. Tape recordings found there reveal the truth about the studio's downfall; after the Bendy cartoons declined in popularity, Joey began looking for a way to bring the characters fully to life and installed the Ink Machine as a means to this end. The first attempt resulted in the creation of Ink Bendy, who was rejected as a monster because he had no soul, and Joey tried to use his employees' souls to create better attractions. This attempt resulted in the creations of the other ink creatures and the studio's [[bankruptcy]]. Henry learns that Ink Bendy has stolen something important from the studio's film vault and enters his lair \u2014 a much vaster version of the ink machine than the one Henry fixed in Chapter 1 \u2014 to retrieve it. Allison and Tom remain behind, fearing that the ink will absorb and corrupt them. Inside, Henry finds one last tape recording by Joey, expressing his regret for everything that has happened and asking Henry to destroy Bendy. Henry finds the item Ink Bendy stole, a reel of film marked \"The End.\" Ink Bendy chases him throughout the machine while transforming into a giant beast, called Beast Bendy. Henry eventually plays the reel, projecting a \"The End\" title card on every available screen and causing Beast Bendy to disintegrate when he sees it.\n\nThe game suddenly changes to a flashback in the inside of a home, covered in letters and sketches related to characters and events from earlier in the game. Entering the kitchen, Henry finds an elderly Joey waiting to talk to him about the paths they took in their lives. After Joey suggests that Henry should visit the old studio, Henry exits the house and finds himself immediately entering it, repeating his opening lines from Chapter 1. It is presumed that Henry, Joey, and all of the studio's employees, ink monsters and ink characters are trapped in a time loop of unknown origin.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the camera focuses on a framed portrait of Bendy, Boris and Alice, which was a gift from Henry to congratulate Joey for the success of the characters (alongside a rusty ink machine sitting in one corner of the room). Just then, a little girl's voice asks \"Uncle Joey\" to tell her another story, implying that the entire game was merely a story Joey was telling his niece.\n\n==Development==\nThe idea for ''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' came from theMeatly pondering the idea of a world that resembled a cartoon sketch. As he started developing the idea, he realized that it felt \"creepy\" and needed a monster that inhabited it. Bendy was created to be that monster, but did not have a name. When the character finally received a 3D model, the name was chosen from a typo while saving it in a 3D modeling program, [[Blender (software)|Blender]]. theMeatly was not a programmer and thus Mike Mood joined the production as he saw potential in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consafosmag.com/2018/02/10/ink-demons-the-indie-canadian-game-scene-an-interview-with-bendy-and-the-ink-machine-programmer-mike-mood/|title=Ink Demons & the Indie Canadian Game Scene: An Interview with \u2018Bendy and the Ink Machine\u2019 Programmer, Mike Mood|website=Con Safos Magazine|last=Villasenor-Baca|first=Antonio|date=February 10, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2019}}</ref> ''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' was inspired by the [[BioShock (series)|''BioShock'' series]].<ref>\"''Creaing a Monster: Bendy and the Ink Machine''\" - [https://www.gamereactor.eu/articles/715713/Creating+a+Monster+Bendy+and+the+Ink+Machine/ Gamereactor]</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] ports were developed and published by [[Rooster Teeth Games]], originally intended to be released on October 26, 2018, while the Nintendo Switch port was scheduled to release on November 20, 2018, but both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One's release dates were pushed to the same date for Nintendo Switch's release.

The sequel, ''[[Bendy and the Dark Revival]]'' is in development.\n\nThe game follows Henry Stein, a retired [[animator]] who returns to his old animation studio Joey Drew Studios from the 1930s after an invitation from his old employer Joey Drew, and discovers a nightmare of cartoon characters seemingly brought to life by the titular Ink Machine.\n\n''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' was well-received upon its initial release, with praise centering on its vintage aesthetic and story. In the months following its release, it quickly gained a massive following from exposure on platforms like [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and eventually was approved through [[Steam Greenlight]] in mid-2017. Merchandise, as well as a mobile spin-off, was later introduced to further promote the game. Mike Mood, the game's programmer and co-creator, described the game as an \"accidental success\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TylerMcAuleyVallier/20170711/301391/The_CoCreater_of_Bendy_and_the_Ink_Machine_Talks_Accidental_Success.php|title=The Co-Creator of Bendy and the Ink Machine Talks Accidental Success|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' is a [[survival horror]] game that features a mixture of puzzle solving, environment exploration and combat to aid Henry on his journey through the darkened halls of Joey Drew Studios. Players explore through a first-person view and have limited physical actions such as running and jumping. Different items can be collected, some of which are required to perform various tasks before proceeding. Cans of [[bacon soup]], a reference to the game's creator theMeatly and his partner Mike Mood, can also be collected for achievements and to restore Henry's [[Health (gaming)|health]] if he is injured.\n\nCombat is primarily focused around a variety of different melee-based weapons, such as an [[axe]], [[piping|pipe]], [[plunger]], or [[scythe]]. There are also long-range weapons such as a [[tommy gun]] or bacon soup cans. In-game enemies all have different strength levels and resilience to damage, forcing players to be tactical about keeping out of reach and striking when necessary. Failure to do so will result in a death. Henry can retreat inside Little Miracle Stations whenever enemies are nearby in order to recover or remain out of sight. If he takes too much damage, he can escape from the ink that consumes him and [[respawn]] at one of the numerous statues of Bendy that act as [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoints]].\n\nIn addition, players can find numerous audio logs throughout the studio that give more details about the game's story, particularly concerning the fate of the studio and its employees, similar to the systems used in games such as ''[[BioShock]]''. Some of these logs can be missed and require further exploration to uncover the secret areas they often reside In.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nAugust 1963, retired animator Henry Stein receives a letter from his former employer and boss, Joey Drew, asking him to return to Joey's [[animation studio]] and see something important. He visits the studio and finds it abandoned, but discovers an \"ink machine\", installed sometime after Henry's departure 30 years earlier. He finds a tape recording that suggests Joey engaged in bizarre occult practices while making the machine, as well as a mutilated real-life analogue of Boris the Wolf, one of the studio's cartoon characters. Once Henry fixes and starts the machine, he is attacked by a creature known as \"Ink Bendy\" that looks like an evil version of the studio's mascot Bendy. As the studio begins to fill with ink, Henry flees toward an exit, only for the floor to collapse and drop him into the studio's lower levels. Draining the ink from several rooms, he finds a chamber whose floor is marked with strange diagrams. He hallucinates seeing the ink machine, a wheelchair and then Ink Bendy before passing out.\n\nHenry wakes up and begins to search for a way out, eventually reaching the studio's music department. Henry finds a stairwell leading to the exit, but the entrance is overflowing with ink. While looking for a way to drain it, he is attacked by a gang of ink creatures known as the Searchers; once they are defeated, Henry enters the office of Sammy Lawrence, the studio's musical director. After completing several tasks to drain the ink, Henry hurries toward the exit but is attacked by Sammy, whose body has been transformed into ink. Sammy intends to sacrifice Henry to Ink Bendy in order to regain his humanity, but before he can do so, he is dragged away by Ink Bendy and presumably killed. Henry frees himself and flees through the studio, pursued by Ink Bendy. Barricading himself behind a door, he waits until Ink Bendy has moved on and then comes to face to face with a living, intact Boris, called Buddy Boris.\n\nHenry befriends Buddy Boris, and the two leave the latter's improvised [[safehouse]] to continue searching for an exit. In the studio's toy department, they find another ink creature called Alice Angel, who is a distorted version of the good character Alice Angel. Alice leads them to her lair and reveals that she has been harvesting the ink of other characters in an effort to keep herself beautiful. Henry must perform several tasks for Alice in order for her to let him and Buddy Boris go free, learning from tape recordings that Alice's original voice actress, Susie Campbell became bitter when Joey suddenly hired a replacement for her. It is implied that the ink transformed this actress into Alice Angel. As Henry carries out Alice's tasks, he must hide from both Ink Bendy and the Projectionist, an entity of projector operator Norman Polk. Henry completes the tasks and boards a lift to escape with Buddy Boris, but Alice forces it to crash to the bottom of its shaft and suddenly pulls Buddy Boris into the darkness, proclaiming that she wants to use him to fix herself.\n\nClimbing out of the crashed lift, Henry ventures deeper into the studio in search of Buddy Boris and finds a lounge filled with the Lost Ones, ink creatures who show no hostility. He also discovers that Joey had been planning to open a Bendy-themed [[amusement park]] with the help of famed ride designer Bertrum Piedmont. Henry enters a large warehouse filled with rides, games, and props from the planned park. In order to reach Buddy Boris, Henry must restore power to the haunted house attraction by finding and flipping a series of switches, one of which is guarded by a ride merged with the remains of a revenge-driven Bertrum. After flipping the last switch, Henry is chased by the Projectionist, who is in turn ambushed by Ink Bendy and killed. Ink Bendy notices Henry but leaves him alone, and Henry enters the haunted house only to find that Alice has turned Buddy Boris into a hulking beast named Brute Boris. Henry is forced to kill him in self-defense. Alice then tries to kill Henry herself in a rage but is killed with a sword from behind. The wielder is Allison Angel, a physically intact and sane duplicate of Alice Angel. She is accompanied by Tom, a wolf character similar to Boris.\n\nAllison Angel and Tom hold Henry captive, but he eventually gains Allison's trust and she gives him a \"seeing tool\" that allows him to see hidden messages on the walls. After Tom inadvertently reveals the location of their hideout to Ink Bendy, he and Allison abandon Henry and flee. Henry escapes on his own and crosses a river of ink on a paddleboat, reaching a shantytown built by the Lost Ones. There, Henry is attacked by Sammy, shown to have survived his encounter with Ink Bendy at the end of Chapter 2 and blaming Henry for Ink Bendy's decision to abandon him. Unmasked by Henry, Sammy gains the upper hand and tries to kill him, only to be killed by Tom instead. After Tom gains Henry's trust, Tom and Allison aid Henry in fighting off the Searchers and Lost Ones, revealed to have been only kept in check by Sammy, and Henry falls into the administration offices. Tape recordings found there reveal the truth about the studio's downfall; after the Bendy cartoons declined in popularity, Joey began looking for a way to bring the characters fully to life and installed the Ink Machine as a means to this end. The first attempt resulted in the creation of Ink Bendy, who was rejected as a monster because he had no soul, and Joey tried to use his employees' souls to create better attractions. This attempt resulted in the creations of the other ink creatures and the studio's [[bankruptcy]]. Henry learns that Ink Bendy has stolen something important from the studio's film vault and enters his lair \u2014 a much vaster version of the ink machine than the one Henry fixed in Chapter 1 \u2014 to retrieve it. Allison and Tom remain behind, fearing that the ink will absorb and corrupt them. Inside, Henry finds one last tape recording by Joey, expressing his regret for everything that has happened and asking Henry to destroy Bendy. Henry finds the item Ink Bendy stole, a reel of film marked \"The End.\" Ink Bendy chases him throughout the machine while transforming into a giant beast, called Beast Bendy. Henry eventually plays the reel, projecting a \"The End\" title card on every available screen and causing Beast Bendy to disintegrate when he sees it.\n\nThe game suddenly changes to a flashback in the inside of a home, covered in letters and sketches related to characters and events from earlier in the game. Entering the kitchen, Henry finds an elderly Joey waiting to talk to him about the paths they took in their lives. After Joey suggests that Henry should visit the old studio, Henry exits the house and finds himself immediately entering it, repeating his opening lines from Chapter 1. It is presumed that Henry, Joey, and all of the studio's employees, ink monsters and ink characters are trapped in a time loop of unknown origin.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the camera focuses on a framed portrait of Bendy, Boris and Alice, which was a gift from Henry to congratulate Joey for the success of the characters (alongside a rusty ink machine sitting in one corner of the room). Just then, a little girl's voice asks \"Uncle Joey\" to tell her another story, implying that the entire game was merely a story Joey was telling his niece.\n\n==Development==\nThe idea for ''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' came from theMeatly pondering the idea of a world that resembled a cartoon sketch. As he started developing the idea, he realized that it felt \"creepy\" and needed a monster that inhabited it. Bendy was created to be that monster, but did not have a name.
