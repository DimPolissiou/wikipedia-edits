Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]].

Though a [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski Agreement|Polish\u2013Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Michta 1990\" />\n\nUntil the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952. By 1947 a colonel of the communist forces declared that \"The terrorist and political underground has ceased to be a threatening force, though there are still men of the forests\" to be dealt with.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Krzyz AK 64081946chl.jpg|thumb|[[Armia Krajowa Cross|Home Army Cross]], awarded to Home Army veterans by the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]]]]\n\nThe persecution of the Home Army was only part of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions in Poland.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.<ref name=\"Peszke 2005\"/> Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom<ref name=\"Embassy PR 2006\"/> were inserted into Poland during the war.<ref name=\"Korb\"/>\n\nBut the air drops were too little, too late.  Air deliveries from the west were limited by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s refusal to let the planes land on Soviet territory; by the low priority placed by the British on flights to Poland; and by extremely heavy losses sustained by Polish Special Duties Flight personnel.  Especially after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Soviets joined the Western Allies in the war against Germany, Britain and the United States attached more importance to not antagonizing Stalin than they did to the aspirations of the Poles to regain their national sovereignty.{{sfnp|Peszke|2013|loc=''passim''}}\n \nIn the end, despite all the efforts, most Home Army forces had inadequate weaponry.

At the beginning of 1944, the Banderites formed two SB militias, which in January attacked Poles.{{sfnp|Motyka|2006|pp=395\u2013396}} To counteract the escalating terror of the OUN and the UPA, the AK and BCh troops carried out an offensive on March 10, 1944, during which about 1,500 Ukrainians were killed.{{sfnp|Motyka|2006|p=396}} The aim of AK and BCh was to intimidate and discourage the Banderites to take larger anti-Polish actions in this area.{{sfnp|Motyka|2016|p=114}} The Lublin district AK command distanced itself from the operation (despite its previous agreement to it). Probably an investigation had been initiated. Captain Marian Go\u0142\u0119biewski, one of the operation's organizers, later complained: \"I was threatened with trial over the so-called genocide.\"{{sfnp|Motyka|2016|p=113}}\n\nIn March 1944, several UPA ''[[kurin]]''s entered the Lublin area and continued killing Poles. The UPA units came into conflict with Polish partisans, leading to the development of a several-dozen-kilometer-long front. Several thousand partisans were involved in the fighting on the two sides.\n\nFrom February to April 1945, mainly in ''Rzeszowszczyzna'' (the [[Rzesz\u00f3w]] area), Polish units (including affiliates of the Home Army) carried out  retaliatory attacks in which about 3,000 Ukrainians were killed.{{sfnp|Motyka|2006|p=578}}\n\n{{See also|Paw\u0142okoma massacre}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gray Ranks]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|refs=\n{{efn|name=a|1=A number of sources note that the Home Army was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe.

Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]]. In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'').{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the \"London government\" fully aware of the others' situation.{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAfter [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of \"two enemies\". Though a [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski Agreement|Polish\u2013Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Michta 1990\" />\n\nUntil the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (\"NO\") was disbande and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Si\u0142 Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised [[amnesty]]. After a number of such broken promises during the first few years of communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe third post-Home Army organization was ''[[Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Niezawis\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'' (''WiN'':  Freedom and Independence).  Its primary goal was not combat, either. Rather, it was designed to help Home Army soldiers transition from partisan to civilian life; while secrecy was necessary in the light of increasing persecution of Home Army veterans by the communist government.<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski\">{{cite book |author=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski |title=Warsaw in Chains |year=1959 |editor= |pages=112\u2013123 |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher=Macmillan Publishing |location=New York |id= |url= |accessdate=|author-link=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski }}</ref> ''WiN'' was, however, in great need of funds, necessary to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and life's savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient. A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952. By 1947 a colonel of the communist forces declared that \"The terrorist and political underground has ceased to be a threatening force, though there are still men of the forests\" to be dealt with.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Krzyz AK 64081946chl.jpg|thumb|[[Armia Krajowa Cross|Home Army Cross]], awarded to Home Army veterans by the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]]]]\n\nThe persecution of the Home Army was only part of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions in Poland.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.<ref name=\"Peszke 2005\"/> Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom<ref name=\"Embassy PR 2006\"/> were inserted into Poland during the war.<ref name=\"Korb\"/>\n\nBut the air drops were too little, too late.  Air deliveries from the west were limited by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s refusal to let the planes land on Soviet territory; by the low priority placed by the British on flights to Poland; and by extremely heavy losses sustained by Polish Special Duties Flight personnel.  Especially after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Soviets joined the Western Allies in the war against Germany, Britain and the United States attached more importance to not antagonizing Stalin than they did to the aspirations of the Poles to regain their national sovereignty.{{sfnp|Peszke|2013|loc=''passim''}}\n \nIn the end, despite all the efforts, most Home Army forces had inadequate weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000\u2013600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers.\"{{r|Leslie|p=234}} On 1 August 1944, when the [[Warsaw Uprising]] began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.{{r|Leslie|p=234}}\n\n==Relations with other factions==\n\n===Relations with Jews===\n{{see also|Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|The Holocaust in Poland}}\n\nHome Army members' attitudes toward Jews varied widely from unit to unit, and the topic remains controversial.<ref name=\"Radzilowski\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert D.

[However] to the Home Army, the Jews were not a part of 'our nation' and ... action to defend them was not to be taken if it endangered [the Home Army's] other objectives.\" He continues to observe that \"it is probably unrealistic to have expected the Home Army\u2014which was neither as well armed nor as well organized as its propaganda claimed\u2014to have been able to do much to aid the Jews.

It was launched on November 18, 2009 by Damian and Susanna Parker, who also co-hosted as \"Brew Happy\", adapted in 2011 as a local Television as \"The Brew Happy Show\", and later relaunched on January 23, 2013 as a regular weekly podcast \"The Brew Happy Show\", with Damian, Mikkel Nielsen, and Asha Sawyer. It has grown to become one of the area's most popular podcasts, regularly receiving thousands of listeners per episode.  The current line-up consists of Damian, John Paul, Ryan Fitzgerald, and Bronwyn Landis.\n\n== History ==\nThe podcast originated around 2009 as Young Winos broadcast out of KPSU college radio and became Brew Happy when Damian DeBuiser pitched the show to internet radio station PDX.FM's Director and Producer, Robert Wagner and Sabrina Miller, re-branding the show as \"Brew Happy\" and bringing on neophyte co-host Susanna Parker, due to her insight as a fledgling apprentice brewer at Salmon Creek Brewing (since sold and re-branded as Old Ivy Brewing). It was a leading show on the network until PDX.FM changed format in late fall of 2010 and became CASCADIA.FM (now also defunct), and subsequently dropping most of their original lineup. Running hot on enthusiasm and expanding interest, the podcast went solo in late Feb. of 2011 released on iTunes by JRomi Productions, along with re-released original episodes from PDX.FM, and normally broadcasting from Red Lion Inn, Vancouver WA. \"Brew Happy\" was hosted solely by former co-host Susanna Parker and continued to be created and released infrequently by JRomi Productions (via www.brewhappy.com). This pilot run founded what would later become 'The Brew Happy Show', as a limited run TV series on public access (via Portland Community Media) in 2012, and re-launched as a weekly podcast with a dedicated schedule, format, and all-new crew (Damian DeBuiser returning as lead Anchor/Host) in 2013.\n\nDamian DeBuiser started The Brew Happy Show as a radio podcast at the end of 2012. His aim, as always, is to enlighten the average Joe/Jane about their favorites beverages and speak to the brewers involved and find out where their inspiration came from. He has interviewed hundreds of the brewers, chiefly in the Portland Metro area as well as some of the surrounding NW. He has interviewed the mayors of Portland, OR and Battleground, WA, Beaverton, OR, and enjoys media access to various craft brew related events while encouraging interest in home brewing and supporting local business. The \"reboot\" from 'Brew Happy' to 'The Brew Happy Show' actually began with Television in mind, due to production strains, the concept was rolled back to a Podcast with a dedicated weekly schedule, an evolving format and crew, and continued with rotating guests with some returning frequently others even semi-regularly with their own segments.\n\n'''Season 1 (2013)''' launched with Damian DeBuiser returning as lead Anchor/Host and writer, Mikkel Nielsen running sound production and hosting through Gnawledge Multimedia, and actor Asha Sawyer as Co-Host and neophyte to the beer industry. Credit also to local singer/songwriter, Christopher Neil Young filling in as substitute co-host and/or producer when needed. Within only 20 episodes they were joined by beer fan John Paul, who has provided sponsorship through his local business Paul's Cigars, and insight as a consumer and active enthusiast.\n\n'''Season 2 (2014)''' saw the previous year's cast continue, with Mark Gillette becoming a frequent guest representing the free local home brewers club, Portland Brewers Collective (PBC), and the addition of a rotating production assistant who would assist with organizing, media, and equipment. This new role was filled by local artist Kenneth Fuller or often by tradesman Ross Glaser. Also, returning guest Matt Harhai tour guide and home brewer began subbing in as co-host and would eventually take over the role as Asha Sawyer leaves to continue pursuing acting and other creative projects (Asha's last show was Ep.#66).\n\n'''Season 3 (2015)''' came with many changes. Still reeling from the loss of Ross Glaser, before the end of the previous year, who had died unexpectedly while in Hawaii. This was a heavy blow, as plans had begun to form for expansion, with Ross planning to bring a significant investment to the small production and hints at a larger role. Co-Host Matt Harhai, would move to Beijing, China to teach English and field report on craft beer abroad. His absence introduced local comedian Amanda Martin-Tully as Co-Host, bringing a fresh flavor or her own, with a noted interest in Cider, and flare for social media interaction. Also, producer Mikkel Nielsen would move to Seattle for family reasons, continuing Gnawledge Multimedia remotely as a podcast network (Mikkel's farewell Ep.#112). His production role would be assumed temporarily by rotating substitutes, resulting in a few unfortunate \"lost episodes\", and harbored in the current and more than capable producer, \"the amazing\" Ryan Fitzgerald (as of Ep.#138).\n\n'''Season 4 (2016)''' saw The Brew Happy Show regaining its footing. As stability had begun to take root, and its format responded to demand, changes saw a rise in interest from listeners and renewed determination from its crew. Now with a steady crew of Damian, John, Amanda, and Ryan, The Brew Happy Show kicked off the year as a champion of emerging home brew contest Stout Bout by PBC, a heightened interest in cider, global trends, local figures, and coverage of more events and brands. Gained also was the introduction of another frequent flyer, beer representative Clay Staley, who'd eventually take a passionately charged \"Staley Stance\" segment, on most of his appearances. This would also see Amanda leaving to more fully explore her expanding opportunities as an impactful female comedian (as of Ep.#184).\n\n'''Season 5 (2017)''' began light on crew with Amanda's absence, but leaned heavily on guest content as the year progressed and content matured and Ryan filling in the open Co-Host role. Damian's personal life though usually only a touchstone in the show, saw a romance blossom, and the introduction of a new role, Media Manager, which would be assumed by the \"lovely and incomparable\" Bronwyn Landis. Her eye for imagery composition and intuitive organizational skills brought a needed resurgence to social media, and even an adorable reluctance toward the conversational input.\n\n'''Season 6 (2018)''' celebrated the emergence of many new brands in the local Portland beer market. Taking a step back from the global market and focusing on a more regional tone, the crew, now as Damian, John, Ryan, and Bronwyn, The Brew Happy Show began to come into its own. With the crew dynamics cementing themselves with a more bubbly and inclusive atmosphere, we began to see interest in the growing community around them, and the introduction of \"The Warren Report\" by writer Warren Wills (craftbeerscribe.com), and a return to homebrew coverage including Mark Gillette and the PBC.\n\n'''Season 7 (2019)''' we see a continued reliance on the local market as we see many of the time honored brands fall to the wayside, as a few emerging brands fill in the gaps. Coverage on the Portland beer scene begins to lead the way for the global market. We begin to see modern trends ripple out from our base, giving The Brew Happy Show an edge as they take on a slightly more serious interest in the changing market, and what consumers as well as entrepreneurs alike can expect. Also Sponsorship by Imperial Yeast and Advertising through Advertisecast lends some much needed support.  This season includes the globe trotting beverage enthusiast Nichole Richardson from the YouTube sensation 'Tasting Nitch' as she is featured in her own segment on The Brew Happy Show, \"Nitch at Nite\".\n\n'''Season 8 (2020)''' is planned for new content and new growth. Stay tuned, wherever podcasts are found.\n\n== Guests ==\nSince late 2009, Damian has had the opportunity to interview people from all walks of life within the \"Brewniverse\", from amateurs, professionals, to enthusiasts alike.  The guest list is extensive but include professionals from brands such as [[Rogue Ales]], [[Rock Bottom Restaurant Breweries]], [[Widmer Brothers Brewery]], [[Deschutes Brewery]], Hopworks Urban Brewing (HUB), [[Alaskan Brewing Company]], Upright Brewing, Migration Brewing, [[Full Sail Brewing Company]], Lucky Lab, Brewing Co., [[Ninkasi Brewing Company]], Breakside Brewing, Gigantic Brewing, Occidental Brewing, Heathen Brewing, Base Camp Brewing, Cascade Brewing, Fort George Brewing, 10 Barrel Brewing, Culmination Brewing, 2 Towns Ciderhouse, 54\u00b040\u2019 Brewing Co., Sasquatch Brewing, Mikkeller Brewing, Natian Brewing, Flyboy Brewing, Pono Brewing, Doomsday Brewing, Oregon City Brewing, Heater Allen Brewing, Allegory Brewing, Feckin Irish Brewing Co., [[Laurelwood Pub and Brewery]], Golden Valley Brewing, and other popular regional brands.  Also now defunct brands such as [[BridgePort Brewing Company]], Coalition Brewing, Amnesia Brewing, The Commons, Columbia River Brewing, Alameda Brewing, to name a few.  If any of the above names ring a bell, you may soon come to be more familiar with emerging brands featured such as Level Beer, Zoiglhaus Brewery, Von Ebert Brewing, Grains of Wrath, Stormbreaker Brewing, Backwoods Brewing, Rosenstadt Brewing, Leikam Brewing, Ruse Brewing, Montavilla Brew Works, West Coast Grocery Co., and many more whose origins are documented on The Brew Happy Show.  Not to mention a catered support for organizations like Oregon Brewer's Guild, Oregon Brew Crew, Portland Brewers Collective, [[Pink Boots Society]], Ladies of Lagers and Ales, and other community based organizations that help this growing culture thrive, and evolve.\nLocations have varied since the The Brew Happy Show is a mobile podcast, with a limited local travel radius, they post up at a local craft beer destination and champion that business as well as beers celebrated on the show each week.  Usually a brewery or a taproom of some sort, with a handful regularly visited each year as a favored hot spot.  The Brew Happy Show seems to enjoy befriending the \"little guy\" in the market and finding out what makes them unique.\n\n== Impact ==\nSeveral other locally produced podcasts about beer in the Portland area have cropped up in the local area since The Brew Happy Show began showing up in local pubs on Monday nights.  Local interest in beer has grown alongside interest in podcasting.  With a wide range of beer related topics being covered from legal, logistics, community, distribution, to even political.  Even former Mayor [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]] was inspired to try his hand at homebrewing with his very own \"Sam Helles\".  The Brew Happy Show's lead Anchor, Damian DeBuiser is proud to MC the annual Stout Bout each year in SE Portland, Producer and Co-Host, Ryan Fitzgerald implores consumers each year to join him at the Vancouver Brewfest, show Sponsor and Co-Host John Paul boasts regularly about his latest beer adventures, and even Media Manager and industry neophyte, Bronwyn Landis chimes in about her latest delicious discoveries.  With extended crew members such as Warren, Clay, Mark, and Nitch, bringing their own following, as well as International Coorespondants and affiliates like Matthew Harhai in China, and Casey Workman in Peru, lending their unique perspectives to the conversation at times.  Feedback from guests has been largely positive, and listeners have increased between 1000 or more each year.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe podcast has taken up the mantle as a champion of the local community with an avid interest in the changing global market.  Numbers constantly streaming from listeners outside the United States with fluctuating numbers throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia, with marked interest from Russia, and Ukraine.  Even listeners in Australia and New Zealand crop up semi-regularly.  There is about 3 to 4 times as many streaming users and users that download.\n\n== Accolades ==\nIn November 2018, The Brew Happy Show was featured in the Portland Podcast Festival by the Funemployment Radio Network.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}} \nThe Brew Happy Show uses the [[Beer, Beer, Beer]] song about Charlie Mopps as their theme song.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|brewhappypodcast.com}}\n* {{RSS feed|http://brewhappypodcast.com/bhrss.xml}}\n* [https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-brew-happy-show/id596254404?mt=2 Apple Podcasts]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/show/2zAtes0PiRENzIVQXFYW1q Spotify]\n* [https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=93945&refid=stpr Stitcher Radio]\n* [http://tunein.com/radio/Brew-Happy-p889548 TuneIn]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brew Happy Show, The}}\n[[Category:Audio podcasts]]\n[[Category:Comedy and humor podcasts]]\n[[Category:Talk podcasts]]\n[[Category:2009 podcast debuts]]\n[[Category:Interview podcasts]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Short description|podcast}}\n{{Infobox podcast\n| title        = The Brew Happy Show\n| image        = The Brew Happy Logo-220.jpg\n| caption      = \n| hosting      = [[Damian DeBuiser]]\n| genre        = Talk\n| format       = {{hlist|Audio}}\n| length       = 1 hour<ref name=\"brewhappypodcast\">{{cite web |title=The Brew Happy Show |url=https://www.thebrewhappypodcast.com |website=brewhappypodcast |accessdate=16 December 2019}}</ref>\n| location     = Portland, OR 97212\n| language     = English\n| production   = Damian DeBuiser <small>(occasional)</small><br>Joshua Rominger <small>(2010\u20132011)</small><br>Mikkel Nielsen <small>(2013\u20132015)</small><br>Ryan Fitzgerald <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n| num_episodes = 348 (as of December 16th, 2019)\n| began        = {{Start date|November 18, 2009}}\n| audio format = MP3\n| video format = [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]]\n| ended        = \n| provider     = Self Hosted\n| ratings      = \n| website      = {{URL|http://brewhappypodcast.com}}\n}}\n\n'''''The Brew Happy Show''''' is a free audio [[podcast]] hosted by American writer, actor, tradesman and television host [[Damian DeBuiser]].

The adopted, or vernacular use of the term Vegetarian, refers to products which do not exclusively result in death to the animals.

The author, however, makes no mention of these products for diet in this work, writing in the opening section that \"no food should be used which necessitates slaughter. Even animal milk and its products, and eggs, would better be discarded; preparations of oat milk, etc., the sap of the South American \"cow tree,\" nuts, vegetable oils, etc., substituted.\"}} It is self described as \"a comprehensive statement of the principal reasons for entertaining vegetarian and fruitarian principle,\" by ''To-Morrow'' magazine as a \"text book of the vegetarian philosophies,\" and \"one of the best manuels of Vegetarianism [which] contains a valuable compendium of the arguments for a pure and human diet\" by the ''Food, Home and Garden'' newsletter.{{sfn|To-Morrow Staff|1907|p=82}}{{sfn|Food, Home and Garden Staff|1898|p=52}}\n\nLimited in its' publication, ''Figs or Pigs?'' was initially sold for 15 cents per issue, though, by the following decade, the price had increased to 25 cents per issue.{{sfn|The Vegetarian Magazine Staff|1911|p=238}}{{sfn|To-Morrow Staff|1907|p=82}} It was added to several libraries within the first few years, including the Public Library of the City of Boston.{{sfn|Boston Public Library Staff|1898|p=13}} ''Figs or Pigs?'' could also be purchased at request from the author, by writing to his home in Springfield, Missouri.{{sfn|To-Morrow Staff|1907|p=82}} Although Allen was in the Christian ministry, ''Figs or Pigs?'' is a vegetarian publication which was markedly not presented in a religious way.{{sfn|Shurtleff|Aoyagi|2014|p=49}}\n\n===Content===\n[[File:FigsorPigspage39.jpg|thumb|The final page, with a poem by Emily M.

The adopted, or vernacular use of the term Vegetarian, refers to products which do not exclusively result in death to the animals. For example, milk, which does not result in death, or eggs, which are considered to be prenatal, and thus, by some medical definition, not living, may still fall under the term of a \"Vegetarian\" diet. The author, however, makes no mention of these products for diet in this work, writing in the opening section that \"no food should be used which necessitates slaughter. Even animal milk and its products, and eggs, would better be discarded; preparations of oat milk, etc., the sap of the South American \"cow tree,\" nuts, vegetable oils, etc., substituted.\"}} It is self described as \"a comprehensive statement of the principal reasons for entertaining vegetarian and fruitarian principle,\" by ''To-Morrow'' magazine as a \"text book of the vegetarian philosophies,\" and \"one of the best manuels of Vegetarianism [which] contains a valuable compendium of the arguments for a pure and human diet\" by the ''Food, Home and Garden'' newsletter.{{sfn|To-Morrow Staff|1907|p=82}}{{sfn|Food, Home and Garden Staff|1898|p=52}}\n\nLimited in its' publication, ''Figs or Pigs?'' was initially sold for 15 cents per issue, though, by the following decade, the price had increased to 25 cents per issue.{{sfn|The Vegetarian Magazine Staff|1911|p=238}}{{sfn|To-Morrow Staff|1907|p=82}} It was added to several libraries within the first few years, including the Public Library of the City of Boston.{{sfn|Boston Public Library Staff|1898|p=13}} ''Figs or Pigs?'' could also be purchased at request from the author, by writing to his home in Springfield, Missouri.{{sfn|To-Morrow Staff|1907|p=82}} Although Allen was in the Christian ministry, ''Figs or Pigs?'' is a vegetarian publication which was markedly not presented in a religious way.{{sfn|Shurtleff|Aoyagi|2014|p=49}}\n\n===Content===\n[[File:FigsorPigspage39.jpg|thumb|The final page, with a poem by Emily M.
