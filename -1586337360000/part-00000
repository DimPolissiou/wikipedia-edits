Latvians share a common [[Latvian language]], [[Latvian culture|culture]] and [[History of Latvia|history]].\n\n==History==\nA [[Finnic languages|Finnic]]-speaking tribe known as the [[Livonian people|Livs]] settled among the Latvians and modulated the name to \"Latvis\", meaning \"forest-clearers\", which is how medieval [[Germany|German]], [[Teutons|Teutonic]] settlers also referred to these peoples.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers referred to the natives as \"Letts\" and the nation to \"Lettland\", naming their colony Livonia or Livland.\n\nThe Latin form, ''[[Livonia]]'', gradually referred to the whole territory of modern-day Latvia as well as southern [[Estonia]], which had fallen under a minimal Germanic influence. Latvians and [[Lithuanians]] are the only surviving members of the [[Balts|Baltic]] branch of the [[Indo-European family]].\n\n==Genetics==\nPaternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R1a]] and [[Haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|N1a1-Tat]]  are the two most frequent, reaching 39.9% each among ethnic Latvians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kasperavicuite.2004.pdf |title=Y Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Variation in Lithuanians |accessdate=2010-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225205400/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kasperavicuite.2004.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 }} Kasperaviciute et al. 2004 (link broken)</ref> R1a has originated in eastern Europe and is associated with spread of Indo-European languages. R1a of Latvians is predominantly M558 and compared to other populations also has the highest concentration of M558 among R1a. N1a1-Tat mutation originated in East Asia and had spread through the Urals into Europe where it is currently most common among Finno-Ugric and Baltic people. Latvians and Lithuanians have a predominance of the L550 branch of N1a1-Tat.\n\n==Culture==\n===Influences===\n[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|200px|In 1649, settlement of the Latvian speaking [[Kursenieki]] spanned from [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] to [[Danzig]].]]\nLatvians share a common language and have a unique culture with traditions, holidays, customs and arts. The culture and religious traditions have been somewhat influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Scandinavia]]n, and [[Russia]]n traditions. Latvians have an ancient culture that has been archaeologically dated back to 3000 BC. Latvians maintained a considerable connection and trade with their neighbors. The first indications of human inhabitants on the lands of modern Latvia date archaeologically to {{circa}} 9000 BC, suggesting that the first settlers were hunters that stayed almost immediately following the end of the last [[Ice Age]]. Colonizers from the south arrived quickly, driving many of the hunters northward as polar ice caps melted further, or east, into modern-day [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] author [[Tacitus]] remarked upon the \"[[Aestii]]\" peoples, thought to be inhabitants of the modern Baltic lands, suggesting that they were abound with formidable, yet peaceful and hospitable people. The Latvian peoples remained relatively undisturbed until [[Papal]] intervention via the [[Germanic Peoples|Germanic]], [[Teutonic Order]] colonized [[Kurzeme region|Kurzeme]] (Courland in English, Kurland in German), beginning in the first half of the 13th century. Papal decrees ordered the Teutonic Order to spread the \"Word of the Lord\" and the [[Gospel]] of [[Christianity]] throughout \"uncivilized\", \"Pagan lands\". Though these attempts to [[Christianize]] the population failed, and the Teutonic Order eventually redeployed southward, to the region of what was once known as [[East Prussia]].\n\nSouth-Eastern Latvia ([[Latgale]]), due to having a relatively large ethnic Russian population, has maintained a large Russian influence.\n\n===Religion===\n[[Image:Aglona Basilica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Basilica of the Assumption, Aglona|Basilica of the Assumption]] in [[Aglona]], the most important [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Latvia]].]]\n[[Paganism]] was the main religion before territory of Latvia was invaded by Christian [[Teutonic Order]]. Latvians still celebrate traditional feasts ([[solstice]]s). [[Dievtur\u012bba]] is a [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] movement which claims to be a modern revival of the [[ethnic religion]] of the Latvians before [[Christianization]] in the 13th century.\n\nMost of the Christian Latvians belong to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia|Evangelical Lutheran Church]], but in [[Latgale]] and [[Alsunga Municipality]] the [[Roman Catholicism in Latvia|Roman Catholic Church]] is predominant, a small minority of Latvians belong to the [[Latvian Orthodox Church]] and other religious congregations.<ref name=\"Tieslietu Ministrija\" /> In the late 18th century, a small but vibrant [[Moravian Church|Herrnhutist]] movement played a significant part in the development of Latvian literary culture before it was absorbed into the mainstream Lutheran denomination.\n\n===Language===\nThe [[national language]] of the Latvian people is [[Latvian language|Latvian]].

Latvians and [[Lithuanians]] are the only surviving members of the [[Balts|Baltic]] branch of the [[Indo-European family]].\n\n==Genetics==\nPaternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R1a]] and [[Haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|N1a1-Tat]]  are the two most frequent, reaching 39.9% each among ethnic Latvians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kasperavicuite.2004.pdf |title=Y Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Variation in Lithuanians |accessdate=2010-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225205400/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kasperavicuite.2004.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 }} Kasperaviciute et al. 2004 (link broken)</ref> R1a has originated in eastern Europe and is associated with spread of Indo-European languages. R1a of Latvians is predominantly M558 and compared to other populations also has the highest concentration of M558 among R1a. N1a1-Tat mutation originated in East Asia and had spread through the Urals into Europe where it is currently most common among Finno-Ugric and Baltic people. Latvians and Lithuanians have a predominance of the L550 branch of N1a1-Tat.\n\n==Culture==\n===Influences===\n[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|200px|In 1649, settlement of the Latvian speaking [[Kursenieki]] spanned from [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] to [[Danzig]].]]\nLatvians share a common language and have a unique culture with traditions, holidays, customs and arts. The culture and religious traditions have been somewhat influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Scandinavia]]n, and [[Russia]]n traditions. Latvians have an ancient culture that has been archaeologically dated back to 3000 BC. Latvians maintained a considerable connection and trade with their neighbors. The first indications of human inhabitants on the lands of modern Latvia date archaeologically to {{circa}} 9000 BC, suggesting that the first settlers were hunters that stayed almost immediately following the end of the last [[Ice Age]]. Colonizers from the south arrived quickly, driving many of the hunters northward as polar ice caps melted further, or east, into modern-day [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] author [[Tacitus]] remarked upon the \"[[Aestii]]\" peoples, thought to be inhabitants of the modern Baltic lands, suggesting that they were abound with formidable, yet peaceful and hospitable people. The Latvian peoples remained relatively undisturbed until [[Papal]] intervention via the [[Germanic Peoples|Germanic]], [[Teutonic Order]] colonized [[Kurzeme region|Kurzeme]] (Courland in English, Kurland in German), beginning in the first half of the 13th century. Papal decrees ordered the Teutonic Order to spread the \"Word of the Lord\" and the [[Gospel]] of [[Christianity]] throughout \"uncivilized\", \"Pagan lands\". Though these attempts to [[Christianize]] the population failed, and the Teutonic Order eventually redeployed southward, to the region of what was once known as [[East Prussia]].\n\nSouth-Eastern Latvia ([[Latgale]]), due to having a relatively large ethnic Russian population, has maintained a large Russian influence.\n\n===Religion===\n[[Image:Aglona Basilica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Basilica of the Assumption, Aglona|Basilica of the Assumption]] in [[Aglona]], the most important [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Latvia]].]]\n[[Paganism]] was the main religion before territory of Latvia was invaded by Christian [[Teutonic Order]]. Latvians still celebrate traditional feasts ([[solstice]]s). [[Dievtur\u012bba]] is a [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] movement which claims to be a modern revival of the [[ethnic religion]] of the Latvians before [[Christianization]] in the 13th century.\n\nMost of the Christian Latvians belong to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia|Evangelical Lutheran Church]], but in [[Latgale]] and [[Alsunga Municipality]] the [[Roman Catholicism in Latvia|Roman Catholic Church]] is predominant, a small minority of Latvians belong to the [[Latvian Orthodox Church]] and other religious congregations.<ref name=\"Tieslietu Ministrija\" /> In the late 18th century, a small but vibrant [[Moravian Church|Herrnhutist]] movement played a significant part in the development of Latvian literary culture before it was absorbed into the mainstream Lutheran denomination.\n\n===Language===\nThe [[national language]] of the Latvian people is [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Latvian is part of a unique linguistic branch of Indo-European languages: the [[Baltic languages]].\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.org/stream/PeoplesOfAllNationsTheirLifeTodayAndStoryOfTheirPast_387/Vol5Latvia#page/n21/mode/2up Latvia.

Senior figures on the newspaper have been held for questioning by police investigating the phone hacking and corruption allegations.

It quickly established itself as a purveyor of titillation, shock, and criminal news. Much of the source material came from coverage of vice prosecutions, including lurid transcripts of police descriptions of alleged brothels, [[streetwalker]]s, and \"immoral\" women. In 1924 the newspaper sponsored the  [[1924 Women's Olympiad]] held at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in London.\n\nBefore long, the ''News of the World'' established itself as the most widely read Sunday paper, with initial sales of around 12,000 copies a week. Sales then suffered because the price was not cut following the [[abolition of newspaper taxes]] and the paper was soon no longer among the leading Sunday titles, selling around 30,000 by 1880, a greater number but a smaller proportion, as newspaper sales had grown hugely. The title was sold by the Bell family in 1891 to [[Henry Lascelles Carr]] who owned the Welsh ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]''. As editor, he installed his nephew [[Emsley Carr]], who held the post for 50 years. The real engine of the paper's now quick commercial success, however, was [[George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell|George Riddell]], who reorganised its national distribution using local agents. [[Matthew Engel]], in his book ''Tickle the Public: One Hundred Years of the Popular Press'' (Gollancz, 1996), says that the ''News of the World'' of the 1890s was \"a very fine paper indeed\". The paper was not without its detractors, though. As one writer later related:\n\n{{quote|[[Frederick Greenwood]], editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', met in his club one day Lord Riddell, who died a few years ago, and in the course of conversation Riddell said to him, \"You know, I own a paper.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you?\" said Greenwood, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"It's called the ''News of the World''\u2014I'll send you a copy\", replied Riddell, and in due course did so. Next time they met Riddell said, \"Well Greenwood, what do you think of my paper?\"\n\n\"I looked at it\", replied Greenwood, \"and then I put it in the waste-paper basket. And then I thought, 'If I leave it there the cook may read it'\u2014so I burned it!\"<ref>J. W. Robertson Scott, ''The Story of the Pall Mall Gazette'' (1950), 417.</ref>\n}}\n\nBy 1912, the circulation was two million and around three million by the early 1920s. Sales reached four million by 1939. This success encouraged other similar newspapers, of which the ''[[Sunday People]]'', the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' are still being published.\n\nIn 1928, the paper began printing in Manchester on the presses of the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' in Derby Street, moving in 1960 into Thomson House, Withy Grove (formerly known as Kemsley House) when the ''News Chronicle'' closed. The move to Thomson House led to the immediate closure of the ''[[Empire News]]'', a paper printed there and mainly circulating in the North of England and Wales with a circulation of about 2.5&nbsp;million. Officially the ''Empire News'' and ''News of the World'' merged but Thomson House was already printing the ''Sunday Pictorial'' (to become the ''Sunday Mirror'') and ''Sunday Times'' and did not have any further capacity with the ''News of the World'' arriving.\n[[File:All human life is there News of the World Dublin.jpg|left|thumb|An advert for the ''News of the World'' in Dublin in 1969]]\nThe paper's motto was \"All human life is there\". The paper's name was linked with sports events as early as 1903 when the golfing tournament The [[News of the World Match Play]] Championship began (now under British PGA auspices). The [[News of the World Darts Championship]] existed from 1927 on a regional basis and became a national tournament from 1947 to 1990. There was also a News of the World Championship in snooker from 1950 to 1959 which eclipsed the official professionals' competition for a number of years. In athletics, the [[Emsley Carr Mile]] race was started in 1953 in memory of the former editor, and is still run annually. The paper's [[News of the World Football Annual|Football Annual]] was a long-standing publication (sponsoring it until 2008), and a Household Guide and Almanac was also published at one time.\n\nBy 1950, the ''News of the World'' had become the biggest-selling newspaper in the world with a weekly sale of 8,441,000 and individual editions sold over 9 million copies.\n\nAs with other [[Sunday newspaper]]s, the ''News of the World'' was published on [[Saturday]] whenever [[Christmas Day]] fell on [[Sunday]].\n\n=== Murdoch ownership ===\nThe newspaper passed into the hands of Rupert Murdoch's [[News Limited|News Ltd.]] in 1969, following an acrimonious year-long struggle with [[Robert Maxwell]]'s [[Pergamon Press]]. Maxwell's Czech origin, combined with his political opinions, provoked a hostile response to his bid from the Carrs and from the editor of the ''News of the World'', [[Stafford Somerfield]], who declared in an October 1968 front page leading article attacking Maxwell<ref>Bill Grundy [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/25th-october-1968/6/mr-maxwell-and-the-ailing-giant \"The Press: Mr Maxwell and the Ailing Giant\"], ''The Spectator'', 24 October 1968, p. 6.</ref> that the paper was \"as British as roast beef and [[Yorkshire pudding]]\".<ref>Roy Greenslade [https://books.google.com/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&pg=PA213 ''Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda''], London: Pan, 2004 [2003], p. 395.</ref>\n\nNews Ltd. arranged to swap shares in some of its minor ventures with the Carrs and by December it controlled 40% of the NOTW stock. Maxwell had been supported by the Jackson family (25% shareholders), but Murdoch had gained the support of the Carr family (30%) and then-chairman William Carr.\n\nIn January 1969, Maxwell's bid was rejected at a shareholders' meeting where half of those present were company staff, temporarily given voting shares. It was Murdoch's first [[Fleet Street]] acquisition. Maxwell accused Murdoch of employing \"the laws of the jungle\" to acquire the paper and said he had \"made a fair and bona fide offer... which has been frustrated and defeated after three months of [cynical] manoeuvring.\"  Murdoch denied this, arguing the shareholders of the News of the World Group had \"judged [his] record in Australia.\" Illness removed Sir William Carr from the chairmanship in June 1969, and Murdoch succeeded him.\n\nMurdoch came under severe criticism in a television interview with [[David Frost]] after in late summer 1969 the newspaper published extracts from the memoirs of [[Christine Keeler]], who had been a central figure of the [[Profumo scandal]] which had emerged to public scrutiny in 1963. Murdoch regretted agreeing to the interview with Frost.<ref>Jerome Tuccille [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mj1FcArTE8C&pg=PA29 ''Rupert Murdoch: Creator of a Worldwide Media Empire''], Washington: Beard Books, 2003 [1989], pp. 29-30.</ref> In February 1970, Stafford Somerfield was sacked as editor after coming into conflict with Murdoch, whose takeover he had opposed.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19700227&id=ppxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E6UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5120,5132358 \"'News of the World' editor sacked\"], ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 February 1970, p. 26.</ref>\n\nThe newspaper often had to defend itself from [[libel]] charges and complaints to the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] (later the [[Press Complaints Commission]]) as a result of certain news-gathering techniques, such as [[entrapment]], and contentious campaigns.

Both newspapers would later endorse [[Tony Blair]]'s [[New Labour]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s before switching back to the Conservatives during [[David Cameron]]'s leadership.\n\nFrom 1981 a magazine (''Sunday'') was included with the paper, and in 1984 the newspaper changed from [[broadsheet]] to tabloid format. The paper was printed in [[Hertfordshire]], Liverpool, [[Dinnington, South Yorkshire|Dinnington]] near Sheffield, Portsmouth, Glasgow and Dublin, with a separate edition produced in Belfast. It was also printed at a number of sites abroad including Madrid, Brussels, Cyprus and Orlando in Florida, USA.\n\nIn 1985, the ''News of the World'' moved out of Thomson House when the building was bought by the tycoon [[Robert Maxwell]] (and renamed Maxwell House) and after a short spell on the ''Daily Express'' presses in Great Ancoats Street moved to a new plant at Knowsley on Merseyside.\n\nIn 2011 the then editor, Colin Myler, described his title as \"the greatest newspaper in the world\" as it won four awards at the British Press Awards.  The main award was for News Reporter of the Year, going to Mazher Mahmood, the \"fake sheikh\" who hides his identity, for his expose of cricket corruption.

The first article targeted [[Donovan]] (who was raided and charged soon after); the second instalment (published on 5 February) targeted the [[Rolling Stones]].  A reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the exclusive London club Blaise's, where a member of the Rolling Stones allegedly took several [[Benzedrine]] tablets, displayed a piece of [[hashish]] and invited his companions back to his flat for a \"smoke\".

''[[International Times]]'' and activist and musician [[Mick Farren]] organised protests outside the Fleet Street offices of the newspaper. Protesters informed the paper's staff that their objective was \"freeing the fucking Stones and closing down the fucking ''News of the World''\". Farren later credited his colleague [[Sue Miles]] with identifying the paper as a target for protest because, as she put it, \"they were the bastards who started this\" (with their feature on drugs in music).

Senior figures on the newspaper have been held for questioning by police investigating the phone hacking and corruption allegations. Arrested on 8 July 2011 were former editor [[Andy Coulson]] and former ''News of the World'' royal editor [[Clive Goodman]], the latter jailed for phone hacking in 2007.

It quickly established itself as a purveyor of titillation, shock, and criminal news. Much of the source material came from coverage of vice prosecutions, including lurid transcripts of police descriptions of alleged brothels, [[streetwalker]]s, and \"immoral\" women. In 1924 the newspaper sponsored the  [[1924 Women's Olympiad]] held at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in London.\n\nBefore long, the ''News of the World'' established itself as the most widely read Sunday paper, with initial sales of around 12,000 copies a week. Sales then suffered because the price was not cut following the [[abolition of newspaper taxes]] and the paper was soon no longer among the leading Sunday titles, selling around 30,000 by 1880, a greater number but a smaller proportion, as newspaper sales had grown hugely. The title was sold by the Bell family in 1891 to [[Henry Lascelles Carr]] who owned the Welsh ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]''. As editor, he installed his nephew [[Emsley Carr]], who held the post for 50 years. The real engine of the paper's now quick commercial success, however, was [[George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell|George Riddell]], who reorganised its national distribution using local agents. [[Matthew Engel]], in his book ''Tickle the Public: One Hundred Years of the Popular Press'' (Gollancz, 1996), says that the ''News of the World'' of the 1890s was \"a very fine paper indeed\". The paper was not without its detractors, though. As one writer later related:\n\n{{quote|[[Frederick Greenwood]], editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', met in his club one day Lord Riddell, who died a few years ago, and in the course of conversation Riddell said to him, \"You know, I own a paper.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you?\" said Greenwood, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"It's called the ''News of the World''\u2014I'll send you a copy\", replied Riddell, and in due course did so. Next time they met Riddell said, \"Well Greenwood, what do you think of my paper?\"\n\n\"I looked at it\", replied Greenwood, \"and then I put it in the waste-paper basket. And then I thought, 'If I leave it there the cook may read it'\u2014so I burned it!\"<ref>J. W. Robertson Scott, ''The Story of the Pall Mall Gazette'' (1950), 417.</ref>\n}}\n\nBy 1912, the circulation was two million and around three million by the early 1920s. Sales reached four million by 1939. This success encouraged other similar newspapers, of which the ''[[Sunday People]]'', the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' are still being published.\n\nIn 1928, the paper began printing in Manchester on the presses of the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' in Derby Street, moving in 1960 into Thomson House, Withy Grove (formerly known as Kemsley House) when the ''News Chronicle'' closed. The move to Thomson House led to the immediate closure of the ''[[Empire News]]'', a paper printed there and mainly circulating in the North of England and Wales with a circulation of about 2.5&nbsp;million. Officially the ''Empire News'' and ''News of the World'' merged but Thomson House was already printing the ''Sunday Pictorial'' (to become the ''Sunday Mirror'') and ''Sunday Times'' and did not have any further capacity with the ''News of the World'' arriving.\n[[File:All human life is there News of the World Dublin.jpg|left|thumb|An advert for the ''News of the World'' in Dublin in 1969]]\nThe paper's motto was \"All human life is there\". The paper's name was linked with sports events as early as 1903 when the golfing tournament The [[News of the World Match Play]] Championship began (now under British PGA auspices). The [[News of the World Darts Championship]] existed from 1927 on a regional basis and became a national tournament from 1947 to 1990. There was also a News of the World Championship in snooker from 1950 to 1959 which eclipsed the official professionals' competition for a number of years. In athletics, the [[Emsley Carr Mile]] race was started in 1953 in memory of the former editor, and is still run annually. The paper's [[News of the World Football Annual|Football Annual]] was a long-standing publication (sponsoring it until 2008), and a Household Guide and Almanac was also published at one time.\n\nBy 1950, the ''News of the World'' had become the biggest-selling newspaper in the world with a weekly sale of 8,441,000 and individual editions sold over 9 million copies.\n\nAs with other [[Sunday newspaper]]s, the ''News of the World'' was published on [[Saturday]] whenever [[Christmas Day]] fell on [[Sunday]].\n\n=== Murdoch ownership ===\nThe newspaper passed into the hands of Rupert Murdoch's [[News Limited|News Ltd.]] in 1969, following an acrimonious year-long struggle with [[Robert Maxwell]]'s [[Pergamon Press]]. Maxwell's Czech origin, combined with his political opinions, provoked a hostile response to his bid from the Carrs and from the editor of the ''News of the World'', [[Stafford Somerfield]], who declared in an October 1968 front page leading article attacking Maxwell<ref>Bill Grundy [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/25th-october-1968/6/mr-maxwell-and-the-ailing-giant \"The Press: Mr Maxwell and the Ailing Giant\"], ''The Spectator'', 24 October 1968, p. 6.</ref> that the paper was \"as British as roast beef and [[Yorkshire pudding]]\".<ref>Roy Greenslade [https://books.google.com/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&pg=PA213 ''Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda''], London: Pan, 2004 [2003], p. 395.</ref>\n\nNews Ltd. arranged to swap shares in some of its minor ventures with the Carrs and by December it controlled 40% of the NOTW stock. Maxwell had been supported by the Jackson family (25% shareholders), but Murdoch had gained the support of the Carr family (30%) and then-chairman William Carr.\n\nIn January 1969, Maxwell's bid was rejected at a shareholders' meeting where half of those present were company staff, temporarily given voting shares. It was Murdoch's first [[Fleet Street]] acquisition. Maxwell accused Murdoch of employing \"the laws of the jungle\" to acquire the paper and said he had \"made a fair and bona fide offer... which has been frustrated and defeated after three months of [cynical] manoeuvring.\"  Murdoch denied this, arguing the shareholders of the News of the World Group had \"judged [his] record in Australia.\" Illness removed Sir William Carr from the chairmanship in June 1969, and Murdoch succeeded him.\n\nMurdoch came under severe criticism in a television interview with [[David Frost]] after in late summer 1969 the newspaper published extracts from the memoirs of [[Christine Keeler]], who had been a central figure of the [[Profumo scandal]] which had emerged to public scrutiny in 1963. Murdoch regretted agreeing to the interview with Frost.<ref>Jerome Tuccille [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mj1FcArTE8C&pg=PA29 ''Rupert Murdoch: Creator of a Worldwide Media Empire''], Washington: Beard Books, 2003 [1989], pp. 29-30.</ref> In February 1970, Stafford Somerfield was sacked as editor after coming into conflict with Murdoch, whose takeover he had opposed.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19700227&id=ppxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E6UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5120,5132358 \"'News of the World' editor sacked\"], ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 February 1970, p. 26.</ref>\n\nThe newspaper often had to defend itself from [[libel]] charges and complaints to the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] (later the [[Press Complaints Commission]]) as a result of certain news-gathering techniques, such as [[entrapment]], and contentious campaigns.

Both newspapers would later endorse [[Tony Blair]]'s [[New Labour]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s before switching back to the Conservatives during [[David Cameron]]'s leadership.\n\nFrom 1981 a magazine (''Sunday'') was included with the paper, and in 1984 the newspaper changed from [[broadsheet]] to tabloid format. The paper was printed in [[Hertfordshire]], Liverpool, [[Dinnington, South Yorkshire|Dinnington]] near Sheffield, Portsmouth, Glasgow and Dublin, with a separate edition produced in Belfast. It was also printed at a number of sites abroad including Madrid, Brussels, Cyprus and Orlando in Florida, USA.\n\nIn 1985, the ''News of the World'' moved out of Thomson House when the building was bought by the tycoon [[Robert Maxwell]] (and renamed Maxwell House) and after a short spell on the ''Daily Express'' presses in Great Ancoats Street moved to a new plant at Knowsley on Merseyside.\n\nIn 2011 the then editor, Colin Myler, described his title as \"the greatest newspaper in the world\" as it won four awards at the British Press Awards.  The main award was for News Reporter of the Year, going to Mazher Mahmood, the \"fake sheikh\" who hides his identity, for his expose of cricket corruption.

The first article targeted [[Donovan]] (who was raided and charged soon after); the second instalment (published on 5 February) targeted the [[Rolling Stones]].  A reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the exclusive London club Blaise's, where a member of the Rolling Stones allegedly took several [[Benzedrine]] tablets, displayed a piece of [[hashish]] and invited his companions back to his flat for a \"smoke\".

''[[International Times]]'' and activist and musician [[Mick Farren]] organised protests outside the Fleet Street offices of the newspaper. Protesters informed the paper's staff that their objective was \"freeing the fucking Stones and closing down the fucking ''News of the World''\". Farren later credited his colleague [[Sue Miles]] with identifying the paper as a target for protest because, as she put it, \"they were the bastards who started this\" (with their feature on drugs in music).

Jeff Schmidt, a guidance engineer on the project, commented upon the difficulties of an underfunded ad hoc program being conducted at a remote location. \"It had become apparent that the instrumentation program was underfunded and behind schedule . . . we went through scrap bins to get wire.\"<ref>McMurran, Marshal W., \u201cAchieving Accuracy A Legacy of Computers and Missiles,\u201d Xlibris, {{ISBN|978-1-4363-8106-2}}  p. 214</ref> \n\nBoeing engineers with the GAPA program, which occupied the pad adjacent to the NATIV effort, jokingly deemed the missile \"North American Tried In Vain\", and after launch failures, labeled it as \"Not Able To Increase Velocity.\"<ref>McMurran, Marshal W., \u201cAchieving Accuracy A Legacy of Computers and Missiles,\u201d Xlibris, {{ISBN|978-1-4363-8106-2}}  p. 215</ref> \n\nThe NATIV was so primitive that there was little provision for range safety. There was no destruct system so if the missile was tracked on an incorrect trajectory by the SCR-584 radars, the only provision to terminate the flight was to shut down the engine by command.<ref name=\"apps.dtic.mil\" />\n\nThe surviving data about the NATIV portion of the MX-770 project is sparse and often contradictory. \n\nThough mention is made in some sources of 20 rockets, there is only record of six attempts to launch NATIV.  \n\nOn the basis of \"successful\" flights the NATIV missile was a resounding failure.   Two flights totally failed, three missiles largely failed, and only one flight succeeded partially.\n\nHowever, the program might well be considered a partial success in that on several missions telemetry of data occurred which was after all was one of the major objectives of the ''North American Test Instrumentation Vehicle''. Under USAF control MX-770 developed into WS-104A which developed the successful RTV-A-5 or X-10 research vehicle, and the much less successful Navaho II (XSSM-A-4, or G-26).<ref>Gibson, James N, \u201cNavajo Missile Project,\u201d Schiffer Publishing, Ltd, Atglen, PA, 1996 {{ISBN|0-7643-0048-2}}, pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nA product of project number '''MX-770''',<ref name=\"Jac\">Jacobs and Whitney 1962, p. 118.</ref> NATIV - the North American Test Instrument Vehicle - was influenced by the design of the [[Wasserfall]] surface-to-air missile developed in Germany during World War II.<ref name=\"DS\">Parsch 2003</ref> Used as a test vehicle for missile technology on behalf of the [[SM-64 Navaho]] project,<ref name=\"Jac\" /> information on the results of the NATIV project are  inconsistent, with some sources claiming six successes of 20 launch attempts,<ref name=\"DS\" /> while others suggest only one of six launch attempts was a partial success.<ref name=\"EA\">Wade,  Mark (ed.) \"[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/nativ.htm Nativ]\".

Due to budgetary restraints a great deal more information had to be readily derived from each of far fewer flights.<ref>Rosenberg, Max, \u201cThe Air Force and the National Guided Missile Program 1944-1950,\u201d USAF Historical Division Liaison Office, June 1964, pp. 82, 113\u2013114</ref> Depending upon the recovery intact of a camera which had recorded the results displayed upon an instrument panel such as was used on the RTV-A-2 (MX-774) was not desirable.<ref>Neufeld, Jacob, \u201cThe Development of Ballistic Missiles in the United States Air Force 1945-1960,\u201d Office of Air Force History, United States Air Force, Washington D.C., 1960, p. 46</ref> Both the number of parameters recorded and the survivability of the film record were limited. NATIV was designed to utilize the then-new FM/FM telemetry to send a number of channels of data in real time during the flight of the missile.<ref>Mayo-Wells, Wilfrid J., \u201cThe Origins of Space Telemetry,\u201d Technology and Culture, Vol.4 No. 4, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland, 1963, pp. 508\u2013509</ref> Development of the NATIV was to contribute to design of the XSSM-A-4 Navajo missile.<ref name=\"Jac\"/>\n\nThe design of the NATIV was influenced by the German [[Wasserfall]] which was proven aerodynamically in the speed range to be studied.<ref name=\"DS\">Parsch 2003</ref> The shape of the missile and its fins were utilized though at 52% of size of the Wasserfall.<ref>Alway, Peter,  \u201cIn The Shadow of the V-2,\u201d  2000, p. 24</ref> The exhaust vanes used for low velocity control of Wasserfall were omitted and preliminary guidance was provided by a launch tower similar to that used by the RTV-A-2 and Aerobee (RTV-N-8 / RTV-A-1)rockets.<ref name=\"apps.dtic.mil\">Mattson, Wayne, and Tagg, Martyn \u201cWe Develop Missiles, Not Air!,\u201d Air Combat Command USAF, Holloman AFB, New Mexico, 1995 Ihttps://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a309953.pdf3, p. 25</ref> The engine for NATIV was a development of the WAC Corporal engine.

There was no destruct system so if the missile was tracked on an incorrect trajectory by the SCR-584 radars the only provision to terminate the flight was to shut down the engine by command.<ref name=\"apps.dtic.mil\"/>\n\nThe surviving data about the NATIV portion of the MX-770 project is sparse and often contradictory. Though mention is made in some sources of 20 rockets there is only record of six attempts to launch NATIV of which there were two total failures, three missiles largely failed with only one partially successful flight.<ref name=\"EA\">Wade,  Mark (ed.) \"[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/nativ.htm Nativ]\". ''Encyclopedia Astronautica''. Accessed 2014-05-08.</ref> On the basis of \"successful\" flights the NATIV missile was a resounding failure. The program might well be considered a partial success in that on several missions telemetry of data occurred which was after all was one of the major objectives of the ''North American Test Instrumentation Vehicle''. Under USAF control MX-770 developed into WS-104A which developed the successful RTV-A-5 or X-10 research vehicle, and the much less successful Navaho II (XSSM-A-4, or G-26).<ref>Gibson, James N, \u201cNavajo Missile Project,\u201d Schiffer Publishing, Ltd, Atglen, PA, 1996 {{ISBN|0-7643-0048-2}}, pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nA product of project number '''MX-770''',<ref name=\"Jac\">Jacobs and Whitney 1962, p. 118.</ref> NATIV - the North American Test Instrument Vehicle - was influenced by the design of the [[Wasserfall]] surface-to-air missile developed in Germany during World War II.<ref name=\"DS\">Parsch 2003</ref> Used as a test vehicle for missile technology on behalf of the [[SM-64 Navaho]] project,<ref name=\"Jac\"/> information on the results of the NATIV project are  inconsistent, with some sources claiming six successes of 20 launch attempts,<ref name=\"DS\"/> while others suggest only one of six launch attempts was a partial success.<ref name=\"EA\"/>\n\nNATIV was a highly classified program in a highly classified subject and as a result, little hard fact was publicized at the time. By the time the information could be declassified development in the field had made it irrelevant. While almost lost in the history of missile development in the United States NATIV, RTV-A-3, was important for what it was a contributing portion of, both in telemetry and the greater MX-770 program.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol8no4/html/v08i4a03p_0001.htm |title=Telemetry Analysis |year=1994 |work=Center for the Study of Intelligence |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=2020-01-30}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Fulton |first2=Sonya |last2=Cooper |title= Full Moral and Material Strength |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a328368.pdf |date=1996 |publisher=Air Combat Command United States Air Force}}\n*{{cite book |first= David H |last= DeVorkin |title= Science With A Vengeance |publisher=Springer-Verlag |date= 1993 |isbn= 0387941371}}\n* {{cite book |last=Gibson |first=James |title=The Navaho Missile Project: The Story of the Know-How missile of American Rocketry |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gAfdAAAACAAJ |publisher=Schiffer |year=1996 |ISBN=9780764300486 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Jacobs |first1=Hoarce |author2=Eunice Whitney|title=Missile and Space Projects Guide: 1962 | year=1962 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1489969675}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Gregory P. |last1=Kennedy |title= he Rockets and Missiles of White Sands Proving Ground 1945-1958 |date=2009 |publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd. |isbn= 9780764332517}}\n*{{cite web|last1=MacMillen.com|first1=|title=North American Aviation (NAA) Project NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Air Force Project RTV-A-3 |url=http://www.macmillen.com/rocketry/nativ/index.html|accessdate=30 January 2020}}\n*{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Curt|title=projecthabu.com/post/151537963920/cape-canaveral-air-force-station-in-florida|url=http://projecthabu.com/post/151537963920/cape-canaveral-air-force-station-in-florida|accessdate=30 June 2017}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Wayne |last1=Mattson |first2=Martyn |last2=Tagg |title= We Develop Missiles not Air! |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a309953.pdf |date=1995 |publisher=Air Combat Command United States Air Force}}\n* {{cite book |last=McMurran |first=Marshal |title=Achieving Accuracy A Legacy of Computers and Missiles | year=2008 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |location= |isbn=978-1-4363-8106-2}}\n*{{cite book |first=Jacob |last= Neufeld |title= The Development of ballistic Missiles in the United States Air Force1945-1960 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=mtDmAwAAQBAJ |publisher=Defense Lion |date= 2012 |isbn= 9780985973001 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app1/rtv-a-3.html |title=RTV-A-3 |first=Andreas |last=Parsch |year=2003 |work=Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles |publisher=designation-systems.net |accessdate=2014-05-08}}\n*{{cite book |first=Max |last= Rosenberg |title= The Air Force and the National Guided Missile Program |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=mtDmAwAAQBAJ |publisher=Defense Lion |date= 2012 |isbn= 9780985973001 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Sutton |first=George |title=History of Liquid Propellent Rocket Engines | year=2006 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |location=Reston Virginia |isbn=1-56347-649-5}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Martyn |last1=Tagg |title= Air planes, Combat and Maintenance Crews and Air Bases  |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a375116.pdf |date=1998 |publisher=Air Combat Command United States Air Force }}\n* {{cite book |last=Telemetry Group|title=Telemetry (TM) Systems Radio Frequency (F) Handbook | year=2008 |publisher=Range Commanders Council, Document 120-08 |location=White Sands Missile Range}}\n* Werrell, Kenneth P.

Fit For A King\u2019s obvious ability to layer a record with an ever growing range of styles is the highlight of this album as a whole, and their keen eye for detailing in song structure is definitely their biggest strength.

Fit For A King are poised to make big waves with ''Deathgrip'', so be sure to keep your eye on the band in years to come.\"<ref name=\"Sound Fiction\"/> Nick Abela of Metal Injection reports \"All in all Deathgrip is a solid release.  It's the same style of music that Fit For A King has been writing for half of a decade now but better.  The breakdowns, the riffs, the drumming, the clean vocals to the entire feel of the whole record is a great example of how metalcore is still alive and well in 2016.  Though there are a few less surprises than anticipated with the album there are still some moments that are unexpected and makes it a record that you can find yourself listening to more than once.\"<ref name=\"Metal Injection\"/>\n\nConnor Welsh of New Transcendence wrote \"Previous efforts from Fit for a King were varying shades of solid\u2014engaging, catchy and aggressive, but all plagued by errant monotony that made each release wear thin rather quickly. ''Deathgrip'' does away with that\u2014stripping out some of the more superfluous aspects of the band\u2019s dynamic to give a raw, relentless display of comprehensive metal-turned-hardcore mastery that demands to be acknowledged. With dissonant, downtuned bruisers like \u201cStacking Bodies\u201d to send mosh pits into full-swing contrasted by more emotionally riveting songs like \u201cCold Room,\u201d telling the story of the death of a child and the struggle to feel complete as a parent thereafter, Deathgrip devastates with its heaviness, but also does a number on the listener\u2019s emotional sensibilities as well. Fit for a King are as furious as we\u2019ve ever heard them\u2014but ten times more mature, energetic, dynamic and explosive, making Deathgrip an album that, after years of growth, is truly fit for a king.\"<ref name=\"New Transcendence\"/> Randy Shatkowski of Antihero Magazine replied \"As an album, Deathgrip isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s familiar, often too familiar. When that\u2019s the only noticeable problem with an album this strong, though, that familiarity is easily forgivable. The long and short of it is, yes, a couple tracks here are weak, but more than twice that many songs are highlights, not just of the album, or even the band, but the genre as a whole. That\u2019s worth a little filler.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiheromagazine.com/album-review-fit-for-a-king-deathgrip/|title=Album Review: FIT FOR A KING \u2013 Deathgrip|publisher=Antihero Magazine|first=Randy|last=Shatkowski|accessdate=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLucas Munachen of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote \"Deathgrip just does everything right. It's not only heavy, but incredibly engaging, choosing to keep the dynamics interesting rather than monotonous, something previous releases too often fell claim to.

Admitting its thematic content may deter more sensitive listeners, Deathgrip deserves nothing but praise.\",<ref name=\"JFH\"/> while Scott Fryberger also of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote \"Lots of heavy riffs, guttural growls, and breakdowns; these things are fine, and I'm sure they make for an excellent and engaging live show, but they don't help my waning interest in heavy music.\"<ref name=\"JFH\"/> Finally, Philip Trapp of [[HM Magazine]] stated \"Few are truly ready for death\u2019s grip, yet we\u2019ll all feel it eventually as dust always returns to the earth. Something can be said for not fearing those who kill the body \u2014 as ISIL did in Paris last year \u2014 since they cannot kill the soul. Fit for a King knows this. Still, those may seem futile words for the families of those who lost their lives at the hands of terrorists. Alongside FFAK, we should all be pissed off at it.

Fit For A King are poised to make big waves with ''Deathgrip'', so be sure to keep your eye on the band in years to come.\"<ref name=\"Sound Fiction\"/> Nick Abela of Metal Injection reports \"All in all Deathgrip is a solid release.  It's the same style of music that Fit For A King has been writing for half of a decade now but better.  The breakdowns, the riffs, the drumming, the clean vocals to the entire feel of the whole record is a great example of how metalcore is still alive and well in 2016.  Though there are a few less surprises than anticipated with the album there are still some moments that are unexpected and makes it a record that you can find yourself listening to more than once.\"<ref name=\"Metal Injection\"/>\n\nConnor Welsh of New Transcendence wrote \"Previous efforts from Fit for a King were varying shades of solid\u2014engaging, catchy and aggressive, but all plagued by errant monotony that made each release wear thin rather quickly. ''Deathgrip'' does away with that\u2014stripping out some of the more superfluous aspects of the band\u2019s dynamic to give a raw, relentless display of comprehensive metal-turned-hardcore mastery that demands to be acknowledged. With dissonant, downtuned bruisers like \u201cStacking Bodies\u201d to send mosh pits into full-swing contrasted by more emotionally riveting songs like \u201cCold Room,\u201d telling the story of the death of a child and the struggle to feel complete as a parent thereafter, Deathgrip devastates with its heaviness, but also does a number on the listener\u2019s emotional sensibilities as well. Fit for a King are as furious as we\u2019ve ever heard them\u2014but ten times more mature, energetic, dynamic and explosive, making Deathgrip an album that, after years of growth, is truly fit for a king.\"<ref name=\"New Transcendence\"/> Randy Shatkowski of Antihero Magazine replied \"As an album, Deathgrip isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s familiar, often too familiar. When that\u2019s the only noticeable problem with an album this strong, though, that familiarity is easily forgivable. The long and short of it is, yes, a couple tracks here are weak, but more than twice that many songs are highlights, not just of the album, or even the band, but the genre as a whole. That\u2019s worth a little filler.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiheromagazine.com/album-review-fit-for-a-king-deathgrip/|title=Album Review: FIT FOR A KING \u2013 Deathgrip|publisher=Antihero Magazine|first=Randy|last=Shatkowski|accessdate=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLucas Munachen of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote \"Deathgrip just does everything right. It's not only heavy, but incredibly engaging, choosing to keep the dynamics interesting rather than monotonous, something previous releases too often fell claim to. It's a powerful result of continued dedication and commitment, and one the band should be immensely proud of. Admitting its thematic content may deter more sensitive listeners, Deathgrip deserves nothing but praise.\",<ref name=\"JFH\"/> while Scott Fryberger also of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote \"Lots of heavy riffs, guttural growls, and breakdowns; these things are fine, and I'm sure they make for an excellent and engaging live show, but they don't help my waning interest in heavy music.\"<ref name=\"JFH\"/> Finally, Philip Trapp of [[HM Magazine]] stated \"Few are truly ready for death\u2019s grip, yet we\u2019ll all feel it eventually as dust always returns to the earth. Something can be said for not fearing those who kill the body \u2014 as ISIL did in Paris last year \u2014 since they cannot kill the soul. Fit for a King knows this. Still, those may seem futile words for the families of those who lost their lives at the hands of terrorists. Alongside FFAK, we should all be pissed off at it. Are we ready?\"<ref name=\"HM\"/> Mason Beard of Indie Vision Music wrote \"Overall, it\u2019s a slamming record. If you are into heavy and melodic music, go buy this thing. Amazing music!\"<ref name=\"IVM\"/>\n\n==Lyrical themes==\nThe song \"Pissed Off\" is written, after the band was scheduled to play a show with [[Eagles of Death Metal]] when the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] occurred.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.solidstaterecords.com/artists/310/Fit_For_A_King/bio/ |date=* |title=Fit for a King }}.

All alkali metals have their outermost electron in an [[atomic orbital|s-orbital]]: this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties.{{refn|While hydrogen also has this electron configuration, it is not considered an alkali metal as it has very different behaviour owing to the lack of [[valence electron|valence]] p-orbitals in [[period&nbsp;1 element]]s.|group=note}} Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of [[periodic trends|group trends]] in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised [[homology (chemistry)|homologous]] behaviour. This family of elements is also known as the '''lithium family''' after its leading element.\n\nThe alkali metals are all shiny, [[hardness|soft]], highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals at [[standard temperature and pressure]] and readily lose their [[valence electron|outermost electron]] to form [[cations]] with [[electric charge|charge]] +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to [[redox|oxidation]] by atmospheric moisture and [[oxygen]] (and in the case of lithium, [[nitrogen]]). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals.<!--YES, NOT FRANCIUM. SEE BELOW.--> All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.\n\nAll of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]]; francium occurs only in minute [[trace radioisotope|traces]] in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural [[decay chain]]s. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group; none were successful. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.\n\nMost alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in [[atomic clock]]s, of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the [[second]]. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits light very efficiently. [[Salt|Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity.

Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.<ref name=chemguide />\n\nThe [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the [[effective nuclear charge]] has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.<ref name=rsc />\n\n=== First ionisation energy ===\n{{Main|Ionisation energy}}\n[[File:First Ionization Energy.svg|thumb|350px|right|Periodic trend for ionisation energy: each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the [[noble gas]]es.]]\nThe first ionisation energy of an [[chemical element|element]] or [[molecule]] is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with [[electric charge]] +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the [[nuclear charge]], the amount of [[shielding effect|shielding]] by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in [[main group element]]s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.<ref name=chemguide /> (This trend is broken in francium due to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations.

This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.<ref name=\"alkaliwater\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronegativity ===\n{{Main|Electronegativity}}\n[[File:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|300px|right|The variation of Pauling electronegativity (y-axis) as one descends the [[main group element|main groups]] of the periodic table from the [[period 2 element|second]] to the [[period 6 element|sixth period]]]]\nElectronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.<ref name=\"definition\">{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}</ref> If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an [[ionic bond]]). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium.

The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.<ref name=chemguide /> Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water:<ref name=rsc /> in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at [[room temperature]].<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|75}}\n\n== Compounds ==\nThe alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends.

The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing [[hydrogen]] gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).<ref name=\"alkalibangs\" /> The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|87}}\n\nRecent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a [[Coulomb explosion]] rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself.<ref name=coulomb>{{cite journal |title=Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with water|journal=Nature Chemistry|doi=10.1038/nchem.2161|pmid = 25698335|date=26 Jan 2015|volume=7|issue=3|pages=250\u2013254|bibcode=2015NatCh...7..250M | last1 = Mason | first1 = Philip E.}}</ref> All alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water.

This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom.

This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised.

Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time.<ref name=Jensen /> However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A\u2013B bifurcation.<ref name=Jensen /> Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.<ref name=Jensen />\n\nThe coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s<sup>1</sup> electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p<sup>6</sup>s<sup>1</sup>; group 11: d<sup>10</sup>s<sup>1</sup>). However, the similarities are largely confined to the [[stochiometry|stoichiometries]] of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid [[ammonia]], as well as having more covalent character in their compounds.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} Finally, the alkali metals are at the top of the [[electrochemical series]], whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear [[transition metal]] character.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au<sup>\u2212</sup>) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a [[pseudohalogen]] because its 5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>1</sup> configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>2</sup> configuration of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}}\n\n== Production and isolation ==\n{{multiple image\n|footer= [[Salt pan (geology)|Salt flats]] are rich in lithium, such as these in Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina (left) and [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]], Bolivia (right).

The remaining insoluble alkali metal [[carbonate]] is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated.<ref name=generalchemistry /> Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with [[calcium chloride]] typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]] for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes [[fractional distillation]] for purification.<ref name=generalchemistry /> Most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity; one of the few which does not is the [[pyrolysis]] of the corresponding alkali metal [[azide]], which yields the metal for sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium and the nitride for lithium.<ref name=King/>{{rp|77}}\n\nLithium salts have to be extracted from the water of [[mineral spring]]s, [[brine]] pools, and brine deposits.

All alkali metals have their outermost electron in an [[atomic orbital|s-orbital]]: this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties.{{refn|While hydrogen also has this electron configuration, it is not considered an alkali metal as it has very different behaviour owing to the lack of [[valence electron|valence]] p-orbitals in [[period&nbsp;1 element]]s.|group=note}} Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of [[periodic trends|group trends]] in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised [[homology (chemistry)|homologous]] behaviour. This family of elements is also known as the '''lithium family''' after its leading element.\n\nThe alkali metals are all shiny, [[hardness|soft]], highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals at [[standard temperature and pressure]] and readily lose their [[valence electron|outermost electron]] to form [[cations]] with [[electric charge|charge]] +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to [[redox|oxidation]] by atmospheric moisture and [[oxygen]] (and in the case of lithium, [[nitrogen]]). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals.<!--YES, NOT FRANCIUM. SEE BELOW.--> All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.\n\nAll of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]]; francium occurs only in minute [[trace radioisotope|traces]] in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural [[decay chain]]s. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group; none were successful. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.\n\nMost alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in [[atomic clock]]s, of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the [[second]]. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits light very efficiently. [[Salt|Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] finds use as a psychiatric medication and as an [[anode]] in [[lithium batteries]]. Sodium and potassium are also [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolytes]], and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.\n__TOC__\n{{clear left}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Petalite.jpg|thumb|alt=A sample of petalite|[[Petalite]], the lithium mineral from which lithium was first isolated]]\nSodium compounds have been known since ancient times; salt ([[sodium chloride]]) has been an important commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word ''salary'', referring to ''salarium'', money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt.<ref>{{OEtymD|salary|accessdate=}}</ref> While [[potash]] has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts.

Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.<ref name=chemguide />\n\nThe [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the [[effective nuclear charge]] has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.<ref name=rsc />\n\n=== First ionisation energy ===\n{{Main|Ionisation energy}}\n[[File:First Ionization Energy.svg|thumb|350px|right|Periodic trend for ionisation energy: each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the [[noble gas]]es.]]\nThe first ionisation energy of an [[chemical element|element]] or [[molecule]] is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with [[electric charge]] +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the [[nuclear charge]], the amount of [[shielding effect|shielding]] by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in [[main group element]]s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.<ref name=chemguide /> (This trend is broken in francium due to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations.

This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.<ref name=\"alkaliwater\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronegativity ===\n{{Main|Electronegativity}}\n[[File:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|300px|right|The variation of Pauling electronegativity (y-axis) as one descends the [[main group element|main groups]] of the periodic table from the [[period 2 element|second]] to the [[period 6 element|sixth period]]]]\nElectronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.<ref name=\"definition\">{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}</ref> If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an [[ionic bond]]). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.<ref name=chemguide />\n\nBecause of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character.

The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.<ref name=chemguide /> Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water:<ref name=rsc /> in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at [[room temperature]].<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|75}}\n\n== Compounds ==\nThe alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends.

Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).<ref name=\"alkalireact\" />\n\nThe smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)<ref name=\"alkalireact\" /> In addition, the small size of the Li<sup>+</sup> and O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful [[oxidising agent]]s. [[Sodium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]] react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in [[submarine]] air purifiers; the presence of [[water vapour]], naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.<ref name=generalchemistry /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=D.

Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time.<ref name=Jensen /> However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A\u2013B bifurcation.<ref name=Jensen /> Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.<ref name=Jensen />\n\nThe coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s<sup>1</sup> electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p<sup>6</sup>s<sup>1</sup>; group 11: d<sup>10</sup>s<sup>1</sup>). However, the similarities are largely confined to the [[stochiometry|stoichiometries]] of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid [[ammonia]], as well as having more covalent character in their compounds.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} Finally, the alkali metals are at the top of the [[electrochemical series]], whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear [[transition metal]] character.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}} Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au<sup>\u2212</sup>) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a [[pseudohalogen]] because its 5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>1</sup> configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>2</sup> configuration of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|1177}}\n\n== Production and isolation ==\n{{multiple image\n|footer= [[Salt pan (geology)|Salt flats]] are rich in lithium, such as these in Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina (left) and [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]], Bolivia (right).

The remaining insoluble alkali metal [[carbonate]] is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated.<ref name=generalchemistry /> Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with [[calcium chloride]] typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]] for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes [[fractional distillation]] for purification.<ref name=generalchemistry /> Most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity; one of the few which does not is the [[pyrolysis]] of the corresponding alkali metal [[azide]], which yields the metal for sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium and the nitride for lithium.<ref name=King/>{{rp|77}}\n\nLithium salts have to be extracted from the water of [[mineral spring]]s, [[brine]] pools, and brine deposits.

Together with [[caesium-134]], [[iodine-131]], and [[strontium-90]], caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the [[Chernobyl disaster]] which constitute the greatest risk to health.<ref name=\"IAEA\" /> Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.<ref name=andyscouse />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{PeriodicTablesFooter}}\n{{Compact periodic table}}\n{{Alkali metals}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Alkali metals| ]]\n[[Category:Groups (periodic table)]]\n[[Category:Periodic table]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Nucleus hydro elemon", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"}

The museum is situated within a {{convert|12500|m2|sqft|adj=mid|-building}} designed by BCW Architects at [[Midland Provincial Park]]. \n\nThe museum was established in September 1985, with many of its initial staff, and items from the collection originating from the [[Provincial Museum of Alberta]]. Initially named the '''Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology''', the museum was later renamed the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in June 1990, following its bestowal of the title \"royal\" from Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. The museum saw the expansion of its building twice in the 21st century. The first expansion was designed by BCW Architects, and was completed in 2003; while the second expansion was designed by Kasian Architecture, and was completed in 2019.\n\nThe museum's personal collection includes over 160,000 cataloged fossils, consisting of over 350 [[holotype]]s.
