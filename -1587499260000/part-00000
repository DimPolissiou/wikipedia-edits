The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river. As the principal seaport on this coast, it soon became a large shipbuilding yard of some importance.

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river.

This split, which has now reversed in most British English, simultaneously shifts this relatively recent {{sc2|CLOTH}} set into a merger with the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} (''caught'') set. Having taken place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot'' vowel, this results in lengthening and perhaps raising, merging the more recently separated vowel into the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel in the following environments: before many instances of {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, and particularly {{IPA|/s/}} (as in ''Austria, cloth, cost, loss, off, often,'' etc.), a few instances before {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (as in ''strong, long, wrong''), and variably by region or speaker in ''gone'', ''on'', and certain other words.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136\u20137, 203\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe standard accent of southern England, [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), has evolved in other ways too, compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding today's RP features of a [[trap\u2013bath split|''trap\u2013bath'' split]] and the fronting of {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}, neither of which is typical of General American accents. Moreover, American dialects do not participate in [[H-dropping]], an innovative feature that now characterizes perhaps a majority of the regional dialects of England.\n\n===Innovative phonology===\nOn the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:\n* [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father\u2013bother merger|Unrounded {{Sc2|LOT}}]]: The American phenomenon of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel (often spelled {{angbr|o}} in words like ''box, don, clock, notch, pot,'' etc.) being produced without [[rounded vowel|rounded lips]], like the {{Sc2|PALM}} vowel, allows ''father'' and ''bother'' to rhyme, the two vowels now unified as the single [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/\u0251/}}.

American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically separate vowels with the [[Homophone|exact same sound]] (especially in the [[American West|West]], northern [[New England]], [[West Virginia]], [[western Pennsylvania]], and the [[Upper Midwest]]), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the [[American South|South]], the [[Great Lakes region]], southern [[New England]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New York metropolitan area]]s) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds {{Pronunciation|Cot-caught distinction.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Labov|2006|p=61}} Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of ''cot'' (usually transcribed in American English as {{IPA|/\u0251/}}), is often a [[central vowel|central]] {{IPAblink|\u00e4|audio=y}} or advanced [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|[\u0251\u031f]}}, while {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to {{IPAblink|\u0252|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|\u0254|audio=y}}, but with only slight rounding.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} Among speakers who do not distinguish between the two, thus producing a ''cot\u2013caught'' merger, {{IPA|/\u0251/}} usually remains a back vowel, {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, sometimes showing lip rounding as {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. Therefore, even mainstream Americans vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. A transitional stage of the merger is also common in scatterings throughout the U.S., most consistently in the [[Midland American English|American Midland]]s lying between the historical dialect regions of the North and South, while younger Americans in general tend to be transitioning toward the merger.

(This innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottal stopping]] also may occur in British English, as well as variably between vowels.)\n* [[Flapping]]: {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} becomes a [[alveolar flap|flap]] {{IPAblink|\u027e|audio=y}} when occurring both (1) after a vowel or {{IPA|/r/}} and (2) before an unstressed vowel or a syllabic consonant other than {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}, including ''water'' {{IPA-all|\u02c8w\u0254\u027e\u025a||En-us-water.ogg}}, ''party'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u02b0\u0251\u0279\u027ei]}} and ''model'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0251\u027e\u026b\u0329]}}. This results in pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' being pronounced the same. Flapping of {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} before a full stressed vowel is also possible, but only when that vowel begins a new word or morpheme, as in ''what is it?'' {{IPA|[w\u028c\u027e\u02c8\u026az\u026a\u0294]}} and twice in ''not at all'' {{IPA|[n\u0251\u027e\u0259\u027e\u02c8\u0254\u026b]}}.

The quality of the merged vowels varies considerably, though it is typically closer to {{IPA|[\u026a]}} when before a consonant; otherwise it is closer to {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=xxi}}\n* Raising of pre-voiceless {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}: Many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} based on whether it occurs before a voiceless consonant or not, so that in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}} but in ''writer'' it is raised to {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is not). Thus, words like ''bright, hike, price, wipe,'' etc. with a following voiceless consonant (such as {{IPA|/t, k, \u03b8, s/}}) use a more raised vowel sound compared to ''bride, high, prize, wide'', etc. Because of this sound change, the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' {{Pronunciation|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, for instance, remain distinct from one another by virtue of their difference in height (and length) of the diphthong's starting point (unrelated to both the letters ''d'' and ''t'' being pronounced in these words as alveolar flaps {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). The sound-change also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place. For instance, a ''high school'' in the sense of \"secondary school\" is generally pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u026asku\u026b]}}; however, a ''high school'' in the literal sense of \"a tall school\" would be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02ccha\u026a\u02c8sku\u026b]}}. This [[sound change]] began in the [[Northern American English|Northern]], [[New England English|New England]], and [[mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the country,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov||Ash|Boberg|2006|p=114}}: \"where Canadian raising has traditionally been reported: Canada, Eastern New England, Philadelphia, and the North\"</ref> and is becoming more common across the nation.\n**Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia dialect areas]] raise {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} rather than {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}</ref>\n* Conditioned [[/\u00e6/ raising]] (especially before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}): The raising of the {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} or {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel occurs in specific environments that vary widely from region to region, though nationwide most commonly before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of \"continuum\" of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[m\u00e6s]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[me\u0259\u032fn]}} for ''man''). In some American accents though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}} are indeed entirely separate (or \"split\") phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0l\u00e6n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0le\u0259n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}}. These are called Mid-Atlantic [[/\u00e6/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] systems. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction (high and forward) in the mouth when compared to the backed Standard British \"[[broad a|broad ''a'']]\", though the two nation's ''a'' systems are probably related phonologically if not phonetically; a British-like phenomenon occurs among some older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} changes to {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.\n* [[Mergers of /\u0252r-/ and /\u0254\u02d0r-/|\"Short ''o''\" before ''r'' before a vowel]]: In typical North American accents (U.S. and Canada alike), the historical sequence {{IPA|/\u0252r/}} (a short ''o'' sound followed by ''r'' and then another vowel, as in ''orange'', ''forest'', ''moral'', and ''warrant'') is realized as {{IPA|[o\u0279~\u0254\u0279]}}, thus further merging with the already-merged {{IPA|/\u0254r/\u2013/o\u028ar/}} ([[horse\u2013hoarse merger|''horse''\u2013''hoarse'']]) set. In the U.S., four words (''tom'''orr'''ow, s'''orr'''y, s'''orr'''ow, b'''orr'''ow'' and, for some speakers, ''m'''orr'''ow'') usually contain the sound {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279]}} instead, and merge with the {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} set (thus, ''sorry'' and ''[[sari]]'' become [[homophone]]s, both rhyming with ''starry'').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}}\n{{English -or- table|header=General American {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254r/}} followed by a vowel, compared with other dialects|hidden=yes}}\nSome mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:\n* [[Horse\u2013hoarse merger|''Horse\u2013hoarse'' merger]]: This merger makes the vowels {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s.

The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.\n\nDifferences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: typically a lack of differentiation between adjectives and adverbs, employing the equivalent adjectives as adverbs ''he ran quick''/''he ran quickly''; different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly \"British\" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''<!--when it means \"to be a student\"-->); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,<ref>Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.</ref> and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.\n\nDifferences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. [[Noah Webster]] popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, \"he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology.\"<ref>Algeo, John. \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language,\" in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.599</ref> Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).<ref>Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511.</ref> AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).\n\nThere are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of [[run-on sentences]], called \"[[comma splice]]s\" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark (\"like this\") over single ('as here').<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html\n |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks\n |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association\n |year=2011\n |format=blog\n |accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nVocabulary differences vary by regions. For example, autumn is used more commonly in the United Kingdom, whereas fall is more common in American English. Some other differences include: aerial (United Kingdom) vs. antenna, biscuit (United Kingdom) vs. cookie/cracker, car park (United Kingdom) vs. parking lot, caravan (United Kingdom) vs. trailer, city centre (United Kingdom) vs. downtown, flat (United Kingdom) vs. apartment, fringe (United Kingdom) vs. bangs, and holiday (United Kingdom) vs. vacation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.studyenglishtoday.net/british-american-english.html|title=British vs. American English \u2013 Vocabulary Differences|website=www.studyenglishtoday.net|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nAmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.\n\nBritish English also differs from American English in that \"schedule\" can be pronounced with either {{IPA|[sk]}} or {{IPA|[\u0283]}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties== <!-- This section is linked from [[Huckleberry Hound]] -->\n{{Side box|above={{Map of American English}}|text=The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'',<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}</ref> as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps].

Boston, [[Western Pennsylvania English|Pittsburgh]], [[North-Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Western American English|Western U.S. accents]] have fully completed a merger of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel with the {{Sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel ({{IPA|/\u0251/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, respectively):<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=60}}</ref> a [[cot\u2013caught merger|''cot\u2013caught'' merger]], which is rapidly spreading throughout the whole country.

Non-rhoticity among such speakers is presumed to have arisen from their upper classes' close historical contact with [[England]], imitating London's ''r''-dropping, a feature that has continued to gain prestige throughout England from the late 18th century onwards,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> but which has conversely lost prestige in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=5, 47}}</ref> Non-rhoticity makes a word like ''car'' sound like ''cah'' or ''source'' like ''sauce''.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 137, 141\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=137, 141}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent and stigmatized regional accents of the country are New York City and [[Southern American English|Southern accents]].<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\">Hayes, 2013, p. 51.</ref> Southern speech, strongest in southern Appalachia and certain areas of Texas, is commonly identified among Americans as a \"country\" accent,<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\"/> and is defined by the {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]]: {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}, the initiation event for a complicated Southern vowel shift, including a \"[[Southern drawl]]\" that makes short [[front vowel]]s into distinct-sounding [[gliding vowel]]s.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 125\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=125}}</ref> The fronting of the vowels of {{sc2|GOOSE}}, {{sc2|GOAT}}, {{sc2|MOUTH}}, and {{sc2|STRUT}} tends to also define Southern accents as well as the accents spoken in the \"[[Midland American English|Midland]]\": a vast band of the country that constitutes an intermediate dialect region between the traditional North and South.

Rather than one particular accent, General American is best defined as an umbrella covering any American accent that does not incorporate features associated with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. Typical General American features include [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]ity, the [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]], [[Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry merger|''Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry'' merger]], [[/\u00e6/ tensing|pre-nasal \"short ''a''\" tensing]], and other [[General American#Phonology|particular vowel sounds]].{{efn|name=fn3}} General American features are embraced most by Americans who are highly educated or in the most formal contexts, and regional accents with the most General American native features include North Midland, Western New England, and Western accents.\n\n===Other varieties===\nAlthough no longer region-specific,<ref>Cf. {{harvnb|Trudgill|2004|p=42}}.</ref> [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and \"[[Yinglish]]\" are spoken by some [[American Jews|American]] [[Orthodox Jew]]s, [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, and [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. [[American Indian English]]es have been documented among diverse Indian tribes. The island state of [[Hawaii]], though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|Language}}\n* [[Dictionary of American Regional English]]\n* [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas]]\n* [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]]\n* [[Help:IPA/English|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for the English Language]]\n* [[Phonological history of English]]\n* [[Regional accents of English]]\n* [[Canadian English]]\n* [[North American English]]\n* [[International English]]\n* [[Received Pronunciation]]\n* [[Mid-Atlantic accent|Transatlantic accent]]\n* [[American and British English spelling differences]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|refs=\n{{efn|name=fn1|English and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] are both official languages in [[Hawaii]], and English and [[Alaska Native languages|20 Indigenous languages]] are official in [[Alaska]].

This split, which has now reversed in most British English, simultaneously shifts this relatively recent {{sc2|CLOTH}} set into a merger with the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} (''caught'') set. Having taken place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot'' vowel, this results in lengthening and perhaps raising, merging the more recently separated vowel into the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel in the following environments: before many instances of {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, and particularly {{IPA|/s/}} (as in ''Austria, cloth, cost, loss, off, often,'' etc.), a few instances before {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (as in ''strong, long, wrong''), and variably by region or speaker in ''gone'', ''on'', and certain other words.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136\u20137, 203\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe standard accent of southern England, [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), has evolved in other ways too, compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding today's RP features of a [[trap\u2013bath split|''trap\u2013bath'' split]] and the fronting of {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}, neither of which is typical of General American accents. Moreover, American dialects do not participate in [[H-dropping]], an innovative feature that now characterizes perhaps a majority of the regional dialects of England.\n\n===Innovative phonology===\nOn the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:\n* [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father\u2013bother merger|Unrounded {{Sc2|LOT}}]]: The American phenomenon of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel (often spelled {{angbr|o}} in words like ''box, don, clock, notch, pot,'' etc.) being produced without [[rounded vowel|rounded lips]], like the {{Sc2|PALM}} vowel, allows ''father'' and ''bother'' to rhyme, the two vowels now unified as the single [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/\u0251/}}. This ''father\u2013bother'' vowel merger<!--Link already present two sentences prior.--> is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in North American English.

American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically separate vowels with the [[Homophone|exact same sound]] (especially in the [[American West|West]], northern [[New England]], [[West Virginia]], [[western Pennsylvania]], and the [[Upper Midwest]]), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the [[American South|South]], the [[Great Lakes region]], southern [[New England]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New York metropolitan area]]s) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds {{Pronunciation|Cot-caught distinction.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Labov|2006|p=61}} Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of ''cot'' (usually transcribed in American English as {{IPA|/\u0251/}}), is often a [[central vowel|central]] {{IPAblink|\u00e4|audio=y}} or advanced [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|[\u0251\u031f]}}, while {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to {{IPAblink|\u0252|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|\u0254|audio=y}}, but with only slight rounding.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} Among speakers who do not distinguish between the two, thus producing a ''cot\u2013caught'' merger, {{IPA|/\u0251/}} usually remains a back vowel, {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, sometimes showing lip rounding as {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. Therefore, even mainstream Americans vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. A transitional stage of the merger is also common in scatterings throughout the U.S., most consistently in the [[Midland American English|American Midland]]s lying between the historical dialect regions of the North and South, while younger Americans in general tend to be transitioning toward the merger.

The quality of the merged vowels varies considerably, though it is typically closer to {{IPA|[\u026a]}} when before a consonant; otherwise it is closer to {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=xxi}}\n* Raising of pre-voiceless {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}: Many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} based on whether it occurs before a voiceless consonant or not, so that in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}} but in ''writer'' it is raised to {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is not). Thus, words like ''bright, hike, price, wipe,'' etc. with a following voiceless consonant (such as {{IPA|/t, k, \u03b8, s/}}) use a more raised vowel sound compared to ''bride, high, prize, wide'', etc. Because of this sound change, the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' {{Pronunciation|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, for instance, remain distinct from one another by virtue of their difference in height (and length) of the diphthong's starting point (unrelated to both the letters ''d'' and ''t'' being pronounced in these words as alveolar flaps {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). The sound-change also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place. For instance, a ''high school'' in the sense of \"secondary school\" is generally pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u026asku\u026b]}}; however, a ''high school'' in the literal sense of \"a tall school\" would be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02ccha\u026a\u02c8sku\u026b]}}. This [[sound change]] began in the [[Northern American English|Northern]], [[New England English|New England]], and [[mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the country,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov||Ash|Boberg|2006|p=114}}: \"where Canadian raising has traditionally been reported: Canada, Eastern New England, Philadelphia, and the North\"</ref> and is becoming more common across the nation.\n**Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia dialect areas]] raise {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} rather than {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}</ref>\n* Conditioned [[/\u00e6/ raising]] (especially before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}): The raising of the {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} or {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel occurs in specific environments that vary widely from region to region, though nationwide most commonly before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of \"continuum\" of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[m\u00e6s]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[me\u0259\u032fn]}} for ''man''). In some American accents though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}} are indeed entirely separate (or \"split\") phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0l\u00e6n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0le\u0259n\u026a\u0308\u0294]}}. These are called Mid-Atlantic [[/\u00e6/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] systems. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction (high and forward) in the mouth when compared to the backed Standard British \"[[broad a|broad ''a'']]\", though the two nation's ''a'' systems are probably related phonologically if not phonetically; a British-like phenomenon occurs among some older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} changes to {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.\n* [[Mergers of /\u0252r-/ and /\u0254\u02d0r-/|\"Short ''o''\" before ''r'' before a vowel]]: In typical North American accents (U.S. and Canada alike), the historical sequence {{IPA|/\u0252r/}} (a short ''o'' sound followed by ''r'' and then another vowel, as in ''orange'', ''forest'', ''moral'', and ''warrant'') is realized as {{IPA|[o\u0279~\u0254\u0279]}}, thus further merging with the already-merged {{IPA|/\u0254r/\u2013/o\u028ar/}} ([[horse\u2013hoarse merger|''horse''\u2013''hoarse'']]) set. In the U.S., four words (''tom'''orr'''ow, s'''orr'''y, s'''orr'''ow, b'''orr'''ow'' and, for some speakers, ''m'''orr'''ow'') usually contain the sound {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279]}} instead, and merge with the {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} set (thus, ''sorry'' and ''[[sari]]'' become [[homophone]]s, both rhyming with ''starry'').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}}\n{{English -or- table|header=General American {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254r/}} followed by a vowel, compared with other dialects|hidden=yes}}\nSome mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:\n* [[Horse\u2013hoarse merger|''Horse\u2013hoarse'' merger]]: This merger makes the vowels {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s.

The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.\n\nDifferences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: typically a lack of differentiation between adjectives and adverbs, employing the equivalent adjectives as adverbs ''he ran quick''/''he ran quickly''; different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly \"British\" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''<!--when it means \"to be a student\"-->); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,<ref>Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.</ref> and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.\n\nDifferences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. [[Noah Webster]] popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, \"he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology.\"<ref>Algeo, John. \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language,\" in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''.

BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).\n\nThere are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of [[run-on sentences]], called \"[[comma splice]]s\" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark (\"like this\") over single ('as here').<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html\n |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks\n |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association\n |year=2011\n |format=blog\n |accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nVocabulary differences vary by regions. For example, autumn is used more commonly in the United Kingdom, whereas fall is more common in American English.

However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.\n\nBritish English also differs from American English in that \"schedule\" can be pronounced with either {{IPA|[sk]}} or {{IPA|[\u0283]}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties== <!-- This section is linked from [[Huckleberry Hound]] -->\n{{Side box|above={{Map of American English}}|text=The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'',<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}</ref> as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps].

As of the twentieth century, the middle and eastern [[Great Lakes area]], Chicago being the largest city with these speakers, also ushered in certain unique features, including the [[fronting (phonetics)|front]]ing of the {{sc2|LOT}} {{IPA|/\u0251/}} vowel in the mouth toward {{IPA|[a]}} and [[tenseness|tensing]] of the {{sc2|TRAP}} {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} vowel wholesale to {{IPA|[e\u0259]}}.

Boston, [[Western Pennsylvania English|Pittsburgh]], [[North-Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Western American English|Western U.S. accents]] have fully completed a merger of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel with the {{Sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel ({{IPA|/\u0251/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, respectively):<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=60}}</ref> a [[cot\u2013caught merger|''cot\u2013caught'' merger]], which is rapidly spreading throughout the whole country.

Non-rhoticity among such speakers is presumed to have arisen from their upper classes' close historical contact with [[England]], imitating London's ''r''-dropping, a feature that has continued to gain prestige throughout England from the late 18th century onwards,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> but which has conversely lost prestige in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=5, 47}}</ref> Non-rhoticity makes a word like ''car'' sound like ''cah'' or ''source'' like ''sauce''.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 137, 141\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=137, 141}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent and stigmatized regional accents of the country are New York City and [[Southern American English|Southern accents]].<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\">Hayes, 2013, p. 51.</ref> Southern speech, strongest in southern Appalachia and certain areas of Texas, is commonly identified among Americans as a \"country\" accent,<ref name=\"Hayes, 2013, p. 51\"/> and is defined by the {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]]: {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}, the initiation event for a complicated Southern vowel shift, including a \"[[Southern drawl]]\" that makes short [[front vowel]]s into distinct-sounding [[gliding vowel]]s.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 125\">{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=125}}</ref> The fronting of the vowels of {{sc2|GOOSE}}, {{sc2|GOAT}}, {{sc2|MOUTH}}, and {{sc2|STRUT}} tends to also define Southern accents as well as the accents spoken in the \"[[Midland American English|Midland]]\": a vast band of the country that constitutes an intermediate dialect region between the traditional North and South.

Rather than one particular accent, General American is best defined as an umbrella covering any American accent that does not incorporate features associated with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. Typical General American features include [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]ity, the [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]], [[Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry merger|''Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry'' merger]], [[/\u00e6/ tensing|pre-nasal \"short ''a''\" tensing]], and other [[General American#Phonology|particular vowel sounds]].{{NoteTag|Dialects are considered \"[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]\" if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever \"dropping\" this sound. The [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPA|/\u0252/}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPA|/\u0251/}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[\u0251~\u00e4]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the \"short ''a''\" vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]]; thus, ''mad'' is {{IPA|[m\u00e6d]}}, but ''man'' is more like {{IPA|[m\u025b\u0259n]}}.}} General American features are embraced most by Americans who are highly educated or in the most formal contexts, and regional accents with the most General American native features include North Midland, Western New England, and Western accents.\n\n===Other varieties===\nAlthough no longer region-specific,<ref>Cf. {{harvnb|Trudgill|2004|p=42}}.</ref> [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and \"[[Yinglish]]\" are spoken by some [[American Jews|American]] [[Orthodox Jew]]s, [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, and [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. [[American Indian English]]es have been documented among diverse Indian tribes. The island state of [[Hawaii]], though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|Language}}\n* [[Dictionary of American Regional English]]\n* [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas]]\n* [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]]\n* [[Help:IPA/English|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for the English Language]]\n* [[Phonological history of English]]\n* [[Regional accents of English]]\n* [[Canadian English]]\n* [[North American English]]\n* [[International English]]\n* [[Received Pronunciation]]\n* [[Mid-Atlantic accent|Transatlantic accent]]\n* [[American and British English spelling differences]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal\n|doi=10.1121/1.418333\n|last=Boyce\n|first=S.\n|last2=Espy-Wilson\n|first2=C.\n|year=1997\n|title= Coarticulatory stability in American English /r/\n|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America\n|volume=101\n|issue=6\n|pages=3741\u20133753\n|pmid=9193061\n|bibcode=1997ASAJ..101.3741B\n|ref=harv\n|url=http://www.asel.udel.edu/icslp/cdrom/vol3/216/a216.pdf\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.16.4174\n}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Phonetics of Dutch and English|edition=5|location=[[Leiden]]/[[Boston]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2002|author1-first=Beverley|author1-last=Collins|author2-first=Inger M.|author2-last=Mees|url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_Collins_Phonetics_of_English_and_Dutch_pdf.pdf|ref=harv|access-date=July 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228163816/http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_Collins_Phonetics_of_English_and_Dutch_pdf.pdf|archive-date=December 28, 2016|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite journal\n|last=Delattre\n|first=P.\n|last2=Freeman\n|first2=D.C.\n|year=1968\n|title=A dialect study of American R's by x-ray motion picture\n|journal=Linguistics\n|volume=44\n|pages=29\u201368\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n|doi=10.1006/jpho.1999.0097\n|last=Hall\u00e9\n|first=Pierre A.\n|last2=Best\n|first2=Catherine T.\n|last3=Levitt\n|year=1999\n|title=Phonetic vs. phonological influences on French listeners' perception of American English approximants\n|journal=Journal of Phonetics\n|volume=27\n|pages=281\u2013306\n|first3=Andrea\n|issue=3\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book |last=Labov |first=William |date=2012 |title=Dialect diversity in America: The politics of language change' |publisher=University of Virginia |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Labov|first=William|authorlink=William Labov|last2=Ash|first2=Sharon|last3=Boberg|first3=Charles|author3link=Charles Boberg|ref=harv|year=2006|title=The Atlas of North American English|location=Berlin|publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]]|isbn=978-3-11-016746-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Longmore |first=Paul K. |date=2007 |jstor=4139476 |title='Good English without Idiom or Tone': The Colonial Origins of American Speech |journal=The Journal of Interdisciplinary History |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=513\u2013542 |publisher=MIT |ref=harv|doi=10.1162/jinh.2007.37.4.513 }}\n* {{cite book |author-link=Peter Trudgill |last=Trudgill |first=Peter |date=2004 |title=New-Dialect Formation: The Inevitability of Colonial Englishes |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author-link=John C.

As a result of secularization the role of religion in modern societies becomes restricted. In secularized societies [[faith]] lacks cultural authority, and religious organizations have little social power.\n\nSecularization has many levels of meaning, both as a [[theory]] and as a historical process. Social theorists such as [[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883), [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939), [[Max Weber]] (1864\u20131920), and [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] (1858\u20131917) postulated that the modernization of society would include a decline in levels of [[religiosity]]. Study of this process seeks to determine the manner in which, or extent to which religious [[creed]]s, practices and institutions are losing social significance. Some theorists{{which?|date=October 2019}} argue that the secularization of modern civilization partly results from our inability to adapt broad ethical and spiritual needs of mankind to the increasingly fast advance of the physical sciences.<ref>See [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 text] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100615170139/http://religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 |date= 2010-06-15 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the \"modernization\" thesis, [[Christian Smith (sociologist) | Christian Smith]] and others argue that intellectual and cultural \u00e9lites promote secularization to enhance their own status and influence. Smith believes that [[intellectual]]s have an inherent tendency to be hostile to their native cultures, causing them to embrace secularism.<ref>Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&ots=F45PpKyvo0&sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&q&f=false The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life] (2012)</ref>\n\nThe term \"secularization\" also has additional meanings, primarily historical and religious.<ref>Casanova, Jose (1994).  ''Public Religions in the Modern World''.  University of Chicago Press, pg. 13. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}}</ref>  Applied to [[Secularization (church property) |church property]], historically it refers to the seizure of church lands and buildings, such as [[Henry VIII]]'s 16th-century [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in England and the later acts during the 18th-century [[French Revolution]], as well as by various [[anti-clerical]] [[Enlightened absolutism| enlightened absolutist]] European governments during the 18th and 19th centuries, which resulted in the expulsion and suppression of the religious communities which occupied them. The 19th-century ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Germany and Switzerland and similar events in many other countries also were expressions of secularization.<ref>Gould, Andrew in: ''Origins of Liberal Dominance: State, Church, and Party in Nineteenth-century Europe'', University of Michigan Press, 1999, p. 82, {{ISBN|978-0-472-11015-5}}</ref>\n\nStill another form of secularization refers to the act of [[Prince-Bishop]]s or holders of a position in a [[Monastic order| Monastic]] or [[Military order (society)|Military Order]] - holding a combined religious and secular authority under the Catholic Church - who broke away and made themselves into completely secular (typically, [[Protestant]]) hereditary rulers. For example, [[Gotthard Kettler]] (1517\u20131587), the last Master of the [[Livonian Order]], converted to [[Lutheranism]],  secularised (and took to himself) the lands of [[Semigallia]] and [[Courland]] which he had held on behalf of the order - which enabled him to marry and leave to his descendants the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]].\n\nThe 1960s saw a trend toward increasing secularization in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. This transformation accompanied major social factors: economic prosperity, youth rebelling against the rules and conventions of society, [[Women's liberation movement | women's liberation]], radical theology, and radical politics.<ref>\nJeffrey Cox, \"Secularization and other master narratives of religion in modern Europe.\" ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte'' (2001): 24-35.\n</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSecularization is sometimes credited both to the cultural shifts in society following the emergence of [[rationality]] and the development of [[science]] as a substitute for [[superstition]]\u2014[[Max Weber]] called this process the \"disenchantment of the world\"\u2014and to the changes made by religious institutions to compensate. At the most basic stages, this begins with a slow transition from [[oral tradition]]s to a writing culture that diffuses knowledge. This first reduces the authority of clerics as the custodians of revealed knowledge. The shift of responsibility for [[education]] from the family and community to the [[Sovereign state|state]] has had two consequences:\n* ''Collective conscience'' as defined by [[Durkheim]] is diminished;\n* Religion becomes a matter of individual choice rather than an observed social obligation.\nA major issue in the study of secularization is the extent to which certain trends such as decreased attendance at places of worship indicate a decrease in religiosity or simply a privatization of religious belief, where religious beliefs no longer play a dominant role in public life or in other aspects of decision making.\n\nThe issue of secularization is discussed in various religious traditions. The government of [[Turkey]] is an often cited{{By whom|date=July 2012}} example, following the abolition of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Caliphate]] and the founding of the Turkish republic in 1923. This established popular sovereignty in a secular republican framework, in opposition to a system whose authority is based on religion. As one of many examples of state modernization, this shows secularization and democratization as mutually reinforcing processes {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. USSR, North Korea, and Cuba could be counterexamples to the previous claim|date=November 2010}}, relying on a separation of religion and state. In expressly secular states like [[India]], it has been argued that the need was to legislate for toleration and respect between quite different religions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiafacts.org/secularism-india-history-implications-alternatives/}}</ref> and that the secularization of the West was a response to drastically violent intra-Christian feuds between [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} have therefore argued that Western and Indian secularization is radically different in that it deals with [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] from religious regulation and control. Considerations of both tolerance and autonomy are relevant to any secular state.{{Citation needed|reason=this is a generalised statement.  Are these considerations really relevant to *all* secular states?|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Definitions==\n[[C. John Sommerville]] (1998) outlined six uses of the term secularization in the scientific literature. The first five are more along the lines of 'definitions' while the sixth is more of a 'clarification of use':<ref>Somerville, C. J. \"Secular Society Religious Population: Our Tacit Rules for Using the Term Secularization''. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (2):249-53. (1998)</ref>\n# When discussing '''macro social structures''', secularization can refer to ''differentiation'': a process in which the various aspects of society, economic, political, legal, and moral, become increasingly specialized and distinct from one another.\n# When discussing '''individual institutions''', secularization can denote the transformation of a religious into a secular institution. Examples would be the evolution of institutions such as [[Harvard University]] from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation).\n# When discussing '''activities''', secularization refers to the transfer of activities from religious to secular institutions, such as a shift in provision of social services from churches to the government.\n# When discussing '''mentalities''', secularization refers to the transition from ''ultimate'' concerns to ''proximate'' concerns. E.g., individuals in the West are now more likely to moderate their behavior in response to more immediately applicable consequences rather than out of concern for ''post-mortem'' consequences. This is a personal religious decline or movement toward a secular lifestyle.\n# When discussing '''populations''', secularization refers to broad patterns of societal decline in levels of religiosity as opposed to the individual-level secularization of (4) above. This understanding of secularization is also distinct from (1) above in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation.\n# When discussing '''religion''', secularization can only be used unambiguously to refer to religion in a generic sense. For example, a reference to Christianity is not clear unless one specifies exactly which denominations of Christianity are being discussed.\n\n[[Abdel Wahab Elmessiri]] (2002) outlined two meanings of the term secularization:\n# '''Partial Secularization''': which is the common meaning of the word, and expresses \"The separation between religion and state\".\n# '''Complete Secularization''': this definition is not limited to the partial definition, but exceeds it to \"The separation between all (religion, moral, and human) values, and (not just the state) but also to (the human nature in its public and private sides), so that the holiness is removed from the world, and this world is transformed into a usable matter that can be employed for the sake of the strong\".\n\n==Sociological use and differentiation==\nAs studied by sociologists, one of the major themes of secularization is that of \"differentiation\"\u2014i.e.,&nbsp;the tendency for areas of life to become more distinct and specialized as a society becomes modernized. European sociology, influenced by [[anthropology]], was interested in the process of change from the so-called primitive societies to increasingly advanced societies. In the United States, the emphasis was initially on change as an aspect of progress, but [[Talcott Parsons]] refocused on society as a system immersed in a constant process of increased differentiation, which he saw as a process in which new institutions take over the tasks necessary in a society to guarantee its survival as the original monolithic institutions break up. This is a devolution from single, less differentiated institutions to an increasingly differentiated subset of institutions.<ref>Martin, David (2005). ''On Secularization: Toward a Revised General Theory''. Ashgate Publishing Company, p. 20. (\"Parsons saw differentiation as the separating out of each social sphere from ecclesiastical control: the state, science, and the market, but also law, welfare, and education etc.\")</ref>\n\nFollowing Parsons, this concept of differentiation has been widely applied. As phrased by [[Jos\u00e9 Casanova (sociologist)|Jos\u00e9 Casanova]], this \"core and the central thesis of the theory of secularization is the conceptualization of the process of societal modernization as a process of functional differentiation and emancipation of the secular spheres\u2014primarily the state, the economy, and science\u2014from the religious sphere and the concomitant differentiation and specialization of religion within its own newly found religious sphere\". Casanova also describes this as the theory of \"privatization\" of religion, which he partially criticizes.<ref>Casanova, Jose (1994). ''Public Religions in the Modern World''. University of Chicago Press, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}} (\"Only in the 1980s, after the sudden eruption of religion into the public sphere, did it become obvious that differentiation and the loss of societal functions do not necessarily entail 'privatization.'\")</ref> While criticizing certain aspects of the traditional sociological theory of secularization, however, [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] argues that the concept of social differentiation has been its \"most useful element\".<ref>Martin, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Current issues in secularization==\nAt present, secularization as understood in the West is being debated in the [[sociology of religion]]. In his works ''Legitimacy of the Modern Age'' (1966) and ''The Genesis of the Copernican World'' (1975), [[Hans Blumenberg]] has rejected the idea of a historical continuity \u2013 fundamental the so-called 'theorem of secularization'; the [[Modern history#Modern Age|Modern age]] in his view represents an independent epoch opposed to Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]] by a rehabilitation of human curiosity in reaction to theological absolutism. \"Blumenberg targets [[Karl L\u00f6with|L\u00f6with]]'s argument that progress is the secularization of [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs and argues to the contrary that the modern age, including its belief in progress, grew out of a new secular self-affirmation of culture against the [[Christian tradition]].\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Cornelius A. |last= Buller |title=The Unity of Nature and History in Pannenberg's Theology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&printsec=frontcover |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&pg=PA95&dq=%22Hans+Blumenberg+targets+Lowith+'s+argument+that+progress+is+the+secularization+of+Hebrew+and+Christian+beliefs+and+argues+to+the+contrary+that+the+modern+age,+including+its+belief+in+progress,+grew+out+of+a+new+secular+self-affirmation+of+culture+against+the+Christian+tradition%22 95]|year=1996|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |location=[[Lanham, Maryland]] |isbn=978-0-822-63055-5}}</ref> [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], a student of L\u00f6with, has continued the debate against Blumenberg.<ref>{{cite book |first=Wolfhart|last=Pannenberg |authorlink=Wolfhart Pannenberg |chapter=Christianity as the Legitimacy of the Modern Age (1968) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22Christianity+as+the+Legitimacy+of+the+Modern+Age%22 |title=The Idea of God and Human Freedom, Volume 3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ |pages=178\u2013191 |year=1973 |publisher=Westminster Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-664-20971-1}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in \"A Secular Age\" challenges what he calls 'the subtraction thesis' \u2013 that science leads to religion being subtracted from more and more areas of life.\n\nProponents of \"secularization theory\" demonstrate widespread declines in the prevalence of religious belief throughout the West, particularly in Europe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Bruce, Steve. God is Dead: Secularization in the West. (2002)</ref>  Some scholars (e.g.,&nbsp;[[Rodney Stark]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]]) have argued that levels of religiosity are not declining, while other scholars (e.g.,&nbsp;[[Mark Chaves]], [[N.&nbsp;J. Demerath]]) have countered by introducing the idea of neo-secularization, which broadens the definition of secularization to include the decline of religious authority and its ability to influence society.\n\nIn other words, rather than using the proportion of irreligious apostates as the sole measure of secularity, neo-secularization argues that individuals increasingly look outside of religion for authoritative positions. Neo-secularizationists would argue that religion has diminishing authority on issues such as [[birth control]], and argue that religion's authority is declining and secularization is taking place even if religious affiliation may not be declining in the United States (a debate still taking place).<ref>Rick Phillips, Can Rising Rates of Church Participation be a Consequence of Secularization?, Sociology of Religion, Volume 65, Issue 2, Summer 2004, Pages 139\u2013153, https://doi.org/10.2307/3712403</ref>\n\nFinally, some claim that demographic forces offset the process of secularization, and may do so to such an extent that individuals can consistently drift away from religion even as society becomes more religious. This is especially the case in societies like [[Israel]] (with the [[Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] and religious [[Zionist]]s) where committed religious groups have several times the birth rate of seculars. The [[religious fertility effect]] operates to a greater or lesser extent in all countries, and is amplified in the West by religious immigration. For instance, even as native whites became more secular, [[London]], England, has become more religious in the past 25 years as religious immigrants and their descendants have increased their share of the population.<ref>Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

Christian Smith examined the secularization of American public life between 1870 and 1930. He noted that in 1870 a Protestant establishment thoroughly dominated American culture and its public institutions. By the turn of the 20th century, however, [[positivism]] had displaced the [[Baconian method]] (which had hitherto bolstered [[natural theology]]) and higher education had been thoroughly secularized. In the 1910s \"legal realism\" gained prominence, de-emphasizing the religious basis for [[law]]. That same decade publishing houses emerged that were independent of the Protestant establishment. During the 1920s secularization extended into popular culture and mass public education ceased to be under Protestant cultural influence. Although the general public was still highly religious during this time period, by 1930 the old Protestant establishment was in \"shambles\".<ref>Smith, Christian.

[...] Along with the early secularization of Chinese society which was equally early, the concomitant demise of feudalism and hereditary aristocracy, another remarkable development, transformed China earlier than any other country into a unitary system politically, with one single power centre.

Among the younger generation (age 18-24) that fraction was only 70%. By contrast, in 2016 these numbers had fallen to <80% (55+) and <40% (18-24).<ref name=\":2\" /> The other age groups were in between these values.

As a result of secularization the role of religion in modern societies becomes restricted. In secularized societies [[faith]] lacks cultural authority, and religious organizations have little social power.\n\nSecularization has many levels of meaning, both as a [[theory]] and as a historical process. Social theorists such as [[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883), [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939), [[Max Weber]] (1864\u20131920), and [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] (1858\u20131917) postulated that the modernization of society would include a decline in levels of [[religiosity]]. Study of this process seeks to determine the manner in which, or extent to which religious [[creed]]s, practices and institutions are losing social significance. Some theorists{{which?|date=October 2019}} argue that the secularization of modern civilization partly results from our inability to adapt broad ethical and spiritual needs of mankind to the increasingly fast advance of the physical sciences.<ref>See [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 text] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100615170139/http://religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 |date= 2010-06-15 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the \"modernization\" thesis, [[Christian Smith (sociologist) | Christian Smith]] and others argue that intellectual and cultural \u00e9lites promote secularization to enhance their own status and influence. Smith believes that [[intellectual]]s have an inherent tendency to be hostile to their native cultures, causing them to embrace secularism.<ref>Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&ots=F45PpKyvo0&sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&q&f=false The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life] (2012)</ref>\n\nThe term \"secularization\" also has additional meanings, primarily historical and religious.<ref>Casanova, Jose (1994).  ''Public Religions in the Modern World''.  University of Chicago Press, pg. 13. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}}</ref>  Applied to [[Secularization (church property) |church property]], historically it refers to the seizure of church lands and buildings, such as [[Henry VIII]]'s 16th-century [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in England and the later acts during the 18th-century [[French Revolution]], as well as by various [[anti-clerical]] [[Enlightened absolutism| enlightened absolutist]] European governments during the 18th and 19th centuries, which resulted in the expulsion and suppression of the religious communities which occupied them. The 19th-century ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Germany and Switzerland and similar events in many other countries also were expressions of secularization.<ref>Gould, Andrew in: ''Origins of Liberal Dominance: State, Church, and Party in Nineteenth-century Europe'', University of Michigan Press, 1999, p. 82, {{ISBN|978-0-472-11015-5}}</ref>\n\nStill another form of secularization refers to the act of [[Prince-Bishop]]s or holders of a position in a [[Monastic order| Monastic]] or [[Military order (society)|Military Order]] - holding a combined religious and secular authority under the Catholic Church - who broke away and made themselves into completely secular (typically, [[Protestant]]) hereditary rulers. For example, [[Gotthard Kettler]] (1517\u20131587), the last Master of the [[Livonian Order]], converted to [[Lutheranism]],  secularised (and took to himself) the lands of [[Semigallia]] and [[Courland]] which he had held on behalf of the order - which enabled him to marry and leave to his descendants the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]].\n\nThe 1960s saw a trend toward increasing secularization in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. This transformation accompanied major social factors: economic prosperity, youth rebelling against the rules and conventions of society, [[Women's liberation movement | women's liberation]], radical theology, and radical politics.<ref>\nJeffrey Cox, \"Secularization and other master narratives of religion in modern Europe.\" ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte'' (2001): 24-35.\n</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSecularization is sometimes credited both to the cultural shifts in society following the emergence of [[rationality]] and the development of [[science]] as a substitute for [[superstition]]\u2014[[Max Weber]] called this process the \"disenchantment of the world\"\u2014and to the changes made by religious institutions to compensate. At the most basic stages, this begins with a slow transition from [[oral tradition]]s to a writing culture that diffuses knowledge. This first reduces the authority of clerics as the custodians of revealed knowledge. The shift of responsibility for [[education]] from the family and community to the [[Sovereign state|state]] has had two consequences:\n* ''Collective conscience'' as defined by [[Durkheim]] is diminished;\n* Religion becomes a matter of individual choice rather than an observed social obligation.\nA major issue in the study of secularization is the extent to which certain trends such as decreased attendance at places of worship indicate a decrease in religiosity or simply a privatization of religious belief, where religious beliefs no longer play a dominant role in public life or in other aspects of decision making.\n\nThe issue of secularization is discussed in various religious traditions. The government of [[Turkey]] is an often cited{{By whom|date=July 2012}} example, following the abolition of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Caliphate]] and the founding of the Turkish republic in 1923. This established popular sovereignty in a secular republican framework, in opposition to a system whose authority is based on religion. As one of many examples of state modernization, this shows secularization and democratization as mutually reinforcing processes {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. USSR, North Korea, and Cuba could be counterexamples to the previous claim|date=November 2010}}, relying on a separation of religion and state. In expressly secular states like [[India]], it has been argued that the need was to legislate for toleration and respect between quite different religions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiafacts.org/secularism-india-history-implications-alternatives/}}</ref> and that the secularization of the West was a response to drastically violent intra-Christian feuds between [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} have therefore argued that Western and Indian secularization is radically different in that it deals with [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] from religious regulation and control. Considerations of both tolerance and autonomy are relevant to any secular state.{{Citation needed|reason=this is a generalised statement.  Are these considerations really relevant to *all* secular states?|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Definitions==\n[[C. John Sommerville]] (1998) outlined six uses of the term secularization in the scientific literature. The first five are more along the lines of 'definitions' while the sixth is more of a 'clarification of use':<ref>Somerville, C. J. \"Secular Society Religious Population: Our Tacit Rules for Using the Term Secularization''. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (2):249-53. (1998)</ref>\n# When discussing '''macro social structures''', secularization can refer to ''differentiation'': a process in which the various aspects of society, economic, political, legal, and moral, become increasingly specialized and distinct from one another.\n# When discussing '''individual institutions''', secularization can denote the transformation of a religious into a secular institution. Examples would be the evolution of institutions such as [[Harvard University]] from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation).\n# When discussing '''activities''', secularization refers to the transfer of activities from religious to secular institutions, such as a shift in provision of social services from churches to the government.\n# When discussing '''mentalities''', secularization refers to the transition from ''ultimate'' concerns to ''proximate'' concerns. E.g., individuals in the West are now more likely to moderate their behavior in response to more immediately applicable consequences rather than out of concern for ''post-mortem'' consequences. This is a personal religious decline or movement toward a secular lifestyle.\n# When discussing '''populations''', secularization refers to broad patterns of societal decline in levels of religiosity as opposed to the individual-level secularization of (4) above. This understanding of secularization is also distinct from (1) above in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation.\n# When discussing '''religion''', secularization can only be used unambiguously to refer to religion in a generic sense. For example, a reference to Christianity is not clear unless one specifies exactly which denominations of Christianity are being discussed.\n\n[[Abdel Wahab Elmessiri]] (2002) outlined two meanings of the term secularization:\n# '''Partial Secularization''': which is the common meaning of the word, and expresses \"The separation between religion and state\".\n# '''Complete Secularization''': this definition is not limited to the partial definition, but exceeds it to \"The separation between all (religion, moral, and human) values, and (not just the state) but also to (the human nature in its public and private sides), so that the holiness is removed from the world, and this world is transformed into a usable matter that can be employed for the sake of the strong\".\n\n==Sociological use and differentiation==\nAs studied by sociologists, one of the major themes of secularization is that of \"differentiation\"\u2014i.e.,&nbsp;the tendency for areas of life to become more distinct and specialized as a society becomes modernized. European sociology, influenced by [[anthropology]], was interested in the process of change from the so-called primitive societies to increasingly advanced societies. In the United States, the emphasis was initially on change as an aspect of progress, but [[Talcott Parsons]] refocused on society as a system immersed in a constant process of increased differentiation, which he saw as a process in which new institutions take over the tasks necessary in a society to guarantee its survival as the original monolithic institutions break up. This is a devolution from single, less differentiated institutions to an increasingly differentiated subset of institutions.<ref>Martin, David (2005). ''On Secularization: Toward a Revised General Theory''. Ashgate Publishing Company, p. 20. (\"Parsons saw differentiation as the separating out of each social sphere from ecclesiastical control: the state, science, and the market, but also law, welfare, and education etc.\")</ref>\n\nFollowing Parsons, this concept of differentiation has been widely applied. As phrased by [[Jos\u00e9 Casanova (sociologist)|Jos\u00e9 Casanova]], this \"core and the central thesis of the theory of secularization is the conceptualization of the process of societal modernization as a process of functional differentiation and emancipation of the secular spheres\u2014primarily the state, the economy, and science\u2014from the religious sphere and the concomitant differentiation and specialization of religion within its own newly found religious sphere\". Casanova also describes this as the theory of \"privatization\" of religion, which he partially criticizes.<ref>Casanova, Jose (1994). ''Public Religions in the Modern World''. University of Chicago Press, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}} (\"Only in the 1980s, after the sudden eruption of religion into the public sphere, did it become obvious that differentiation and the loss of societal functions do not necessarily entail 'privatization.'\")</ref> While criticizing certain aspects of the traditional sociological theory of secularization, however, [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] argues that the concept of social differentiation has been its \"most useful element\".<ref>Martin, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Current issues in secularization==\nAt present, secularization as understood in the West is being debated in the [[sociology of religion]].

Demerath]]) have countered by introducing the idea of neo-secularization, which broadens the definition of secularization to include the decline of religious authority and its ability to influence society.\n\nIn other words, rather than using the proportion of irreligious apostates as the sole measure of secularity, neo-secularization argues that individuals increasingly look outside of religion for authoritative positions. Neo-secularizationists would argue that religion has diminishing authority on issues such as [[birth control]], and argue that religion's authority is declining and secularization is taking place even if religious affiliation may not be declining in the United States (a debate still taking place).<ref>Rick Phillips, Can Rising Rates of Church Participation be a Consequence of Secularization?, Sociology of Religion, Volume 65, Issue 2, Summer 2004, Pages 139\u2013153, https://doi.org/10.2307/3712403</ref>\n\nFinally, some claim that demographic forces offset the process of secularization, and may do so to such an extent that individuals can consistently drift away from religion even as society becomes more religious. This is especially the case in societies like [[Israel]] (with the [[Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] and religious [[Zionist]]s) where committed religious groups have several times the birth rate of seculars. The [[religious fertility effect]] operates to a greater or lesser extent in all countries, and is amplified in the West by religious immigration. For instance, even as native whites became more secular, [[London]], England, has become more religious in the past 25 years as religious immigrants and their descendants have increased their share of the population.<ref>Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

Christian Smith examined the secularization of American public life between 1870 and 1930. He noted that in 1870 a Protestant establishment thoroughly dominated American culture and its public institutions. By the turn of the 20th century, however, [[positivism]] had displaced the [[Baconian method]] (which had hitherto bolstered [[natural theology]]) and higher education had been thoroughly secularized. In the 1910s \"legal realism\" gained prominence, de-emphasizing the religious basis for [[law]]. That same decade publishing houses emerged that were independent of the Protestant establishment. During the 1920s secularization extended into popular culture and mass public education ceased to be under Protestant cultural influence. Although the general public was still highly religious during this time period, by 1930 the old Protestant establishment was in \"shambles\".<ref>Smith, Christian.

In coal-mining districts, local collieries typically funded local chapels, but that ended{{when|date=March 2016}} as the industry grew distressed and the unionized miners rejected \u00e9lite interference in their local affairs.

All this simply means that the pursuit of wealth or power or simply the competition for survival can be and often has been ruthless without any sense of restraint. [...] Along with the early secularization of Chinese society which was equally early, the concomitant demise of feudalism and hereditary aristocracy, another remarkable development, transformed China earlier than any other country into a unitary system politically, with one single power centre.

For instance, in [[Egypt]], support for imposing [[sharia]] (Islamic law) fell from 84% in 2011 to 34% in 2016. Egyptians also pray less: among older Egyptians (55+) 90% prayed daily in 2011. Among the younger generation (age 18-24) that fraction was only 70%. By contrast, in 2016 these numbers had fallen to <80% (55+) and <40% (18-24).<ref name=\":2\" /> The other age groups were in between these values. In [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]], the number of people listening to daily recitals of the quran fell by half from 2011 to 2016.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=4 Nov 2017|title=The new Arab Cosmopolitans.|url=|journal=The Economist|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Some of these developments seem to be driven by need, e.g. by stagnating incomes which force women to contribute to household income and therefore to work. High living costs delay marriage and, as a consequence, seem to encourage pre-marital sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, in other countries, such as [[Jordan]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], support for sharia and islamist ideas seems to grow.

By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator <ref name = \"Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education\">Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.</ref>  A health educator is \"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below. The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced \"a new hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchec.org/news/posts/hespa2|title=Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis II 2020 Validates and Reveals Eight Areas of Responsibility for Health Education Specialists|website=www.nchec.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>.\n\n<br />\n\n==Teaching==\n{{unreferenced section}}\nIn the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90% of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards.

Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

She graduated from the University of Ireland in 1939 and received her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949. She received her doctorate in physical education from Springfield College in 1955. After completing her schooling, Elena Sliepcevich worked at Ohio State University in 1961 as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969, and most health education curricula used in schools today are based on the ten conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study. These ten areas of focus include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse.<ref>[[Elena Sliepcevich]]{{Elena Sliepcevich}}</ref>\n\n==Health Education Worldwide==\n===Romania===\nSince 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education.

By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator <ref name = \"Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education\">Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.</ref>  A health educator is \"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below. The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced \"a new hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchec.org/news/posts/hespa2|title=Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis II 2020 Validates and Reveals Eight Areas of Responsibility for Health Education Specialists|website=www.nchec.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>.\n\n<br />\n\n==Teaching==\n{{unreferenced section}}\nIn the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90% of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards. Retrieved May 1, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/SHER/standards/index.htm</ref>\n\n==Health Education Code of Ethics==\nThe Health Education Code of Ethics has been a work in progress since approximately 1976, begun by the Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE).  Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

She graduated from the University of Ireland in 1939 and received her master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949. She received her doctorate in physical education from Springfield College in 1955. After completing her schooling, Elena Sliepcevich worked at Ohio State University in 1961 as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969, and most health education curricula used in schools today are based on the ten conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study. These ten areas of focus include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse.<ref>[[Elena Sliepcevich]]{{Elena Sliepcevich}}</ref>\n\n==Health Education Worldwide==\n===Romania===\nSince 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education.
