She first became interested in graffiti when she lived in Gaza prior to moving to Egypt. After the advent of the January 25 Revolution, she spent over a year and a half documenting revolutionary street art in Egyptian cities for her book ''Revolution Graffiti: Street Art of the New Egypt''. It was through her research for this book that she was inspired to promote female graffiti; of the 17,000 pieces of street art she documented, only 253 of them included images of women. Of her motivation to start the project, she stated, \u2018\u2019I felt there\u2019s was a need to support female artists, and there\u2019s a very strong need to address women\u2019s issues. Egypt is one of the worst countries when it comes to women\u2019s rights.\u2019\u2019<ref name=\"Can Graffiti Remake Egypt?\"/> Her published works include ''Revolution Graffiti'', ''In Hope and Despair: Life in the Palestinian Refugee Camps'' (2003), ''Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics'' (2009), and ''Tahrir Square: The Heart of the Egyptian Revolution'' (2011).<ref name=\"'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art\">{{cite news|last=ElNabawi|first=Maha|title='Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/women-walls-campaign-empowers-women-street-art|newspaper=Egypt Independent}}</ref>\n\n==== Angie Balata ====\nAngie Balata is the local cultural manager for the Women on Walls Project. She worked with Gr\u00f6ndahl on ''Revolution Graffiti'', documenting pieces, networking with street artists, and providing translations. Upon completing the book, the two women collaborated to expand the book launch into a larger exhibition, which became WOW.<ref name=\"'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art\"/>\n\n=== First Edition ===\nThe first Women on Walls campaign was launched in April 2013, with nearly 40 artists participating, in the cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, and Mansoura.<ref name=\"Women on Walls\"/> Each city had a separate campaign led by well-known local graffiti artists: Mira Shahadeh and Zeft led the Cairo campaign, [[Ammar Abo Bakr]] led the Luxor campaign, Mohamed Khaled and Ghadir Wagdy led the Mansoura campaign, and [[Aya Tarek]], Yazaan El Zo\u2019bi, and Mohaned Nor led the Alexandria campaign. The campaigns were divided into two parts. The first part brought street artists to the town of Anafora for gender-related workshops, to learn about gender sensitive issues and work on how to discuss these issues in the street. In the second part, the artists returned to their respective cities to design pieces reflecting what they learned in the workshops. At the end, the project held a closing ceremony for final remarks and analysis of the finished work.<ref name=\"'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art\"/>\n\nNotable participants included:\n* Abo Bakr\n* Hanaa El Degham\n* Ahmed Abdallah\n* Ahmed Tony\n* Sad Panda\n* Mohamed El Moushir\n* the Mona Lisa Brigades<ref name=\"Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Women on Walls graffiti campaign\"/><ref name=\"Can Graffiti Remake Egypt?\"/>\n\n=== Second edition ===\nThe second campaign ran from February 8 to February 15, 2014, with 15 participating artists. Due to limited funds, the 2014 campaign only ran in Cairo. As with the first campaign, participants attended seminars and workshops with artists and feminist activists, including [[Cecilia Udd\u00e9n]], [[Carolina Falkholt]], Radwa Fouda, Lamis Soleiman and Ismail Shawky, and then collaborated upon painting women into the public space.

She first became interested in graffiti when she lived in Gaza prior to moving to Egypt. After the advent of the January 25 Revolution, she spent over a year and a half documenting revolutionary street art in Egyptian cities for her book ''Revolution Graffiti: Street Art of the New Egypt''. It was through her research for this book that she was inspired to promote female graffiti; of the 17,000 pieces of street art she documented, only 253 of them included images of women. Of her motivation to start the project, she stated, \u2018\u2019I felt there\u2019s was a need to support female artists, and there\u2019s a very strong need to address women\u2019s issues.

She worked with Gr\u00f6ndahl on ''Revolution Graffiti'', documenting pieces, networking with street artists, and providing translations. Upon completing the book, the two women collaborated to expand the book launch into a larger exhibition, which became WOW.<ref name=\"'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art\"/>\n\n=== First Edition ===\nThe first Women on Walls campaign was launched in April 2013, with nearly 40 artists participating, in the cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, and Mansoura.<ref name=\"Women on Walls\"/> Each city had a separate campaign led by well-known local graffiti artists: Mira Shahadeh and Zeft led the Cairo campaign, [[Ammar Abo Bakr]] led the Luxor campaign, Mohamed Khaled and Ghadir Wagdy led the Mansoura campaign, and [[Aya Tarek]], Yazaan El Zo\u2019bi, and Mohaned Nor led the Alexandria campaign. The campaigns were divided into two parts. The first part brought street artists to the town of Anafora for gender-related workshops, to learn about gender sensitive issues and work on how to discuss these issues in the street. In the second part, the artists returned to their respective cities to design pieces reflecting what they learned in the workshops. At the end, the project held a closing ceremony for final remarks and analysis of the finished work.<ref name=\"'Women on Walls' campaign empowers women via street art\"/>\n\nNotable participants included:\n* Abo Bakr\n* Hanaa El Degham\n* Ahmed Abdallah\n* Ahmed Tony\n* Sad Panda\n* Mohamed El Moushir\n* the Mona Lisa Brigades<ref name=\"Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Women on Walls graffiti campaign\"/><ref name=\"Can Graffiti Remake Egypt?\"/>\n\n=== Second edition ===\nThe second campaign ran from February 8 to February 15, 2014, with 15 participating artists. Due to limited funds, the 2014 campaign only ran in Cairo. As with the first campaign, participants attended seminars and workshops with artists and feminist activists, including [[Cecilia Udd\u00e9n]], [[Carolina Falkholt]], Radwa Fouda, Lamis Soleiman and Ismail Shawky, and then collaborated upon painting women into the public space. In addition, the second campaign partnered with organizations such as Egyptian feminist organization Nazra, and anti-harassment organization HarassMap in order to further educate participants on women's rights issues specific to Egypt.<ref name=\"Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Women on Walls graffiti campaign\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Egyptian art]]\n[[Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage]]\n[[Category:Women in Egypt]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMission:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_on_Walls"}

Vivekananda experienced overt racism, particularly in the South, where he was often confused for an African American. Some blacks also believed Vivekananda was a \u201cdistinguished Negro,\u201d and in one case, a black porter congratulated him for representing black people so well.

Its first African-American student was enrolled in 1902; its first female student in 1922.\n\nIn 1919, the [[Knights of Columbus]] founded an educational program known as [[History of the Knights of Columbus and The Catholic University  of America#Columbus School of Law|Columbus University]] which provided an evening education program for Catholic war veterans returning from World War I.  This institution was closely affiliated with Catholic University and shared faculty at both institutions' Washington, D.C. locations.\n\nIn 1954 Columbus University (now consisting only of an evening law school) merged with Catholic University's law school to form the Columbus School of Law.  The law school has been accredited by the [[Association of American Law Schools]] since 1921<ref name=\"AALS\">{{cite web|title=AALS Member and Fee-Paid Schools|url=http://www.aals.org/about_memberschools.php|website=AALS|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref> and the [[American Bar Association]] since 1925.<ref name=\"ABA List\">{{cite web|title=Alphabetical School List|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/aba_approved_law_schools/in_alphabetical_order.html|website=ABA|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\n=== Curriculum ===\n[[File:Columbus School of Law CUA.JPG|thumb|235px|Columbus School of Law]]\n\nCatholic University's J.D. program can be completed over three years of full-time day study or four years of part-time evening study.\n\nThe first-year curriculum is prescribed for all students.

Revised for 2013, the new curriculum is designed to strengthen first-year doctrinal courses, to support the development of practice-area concentrations, and to emphasize training that will help graduates transition to the real world of practice.\n\nThe upper-division curriculum comprises several requirements, courses that are strongly recommended, and elective options. CUA Law students must complete a minimum of 84 credits to earn the J.D. degree. Required upper division courses include Constitutional Law II, Professional Responsibility, Professional Skills, and Upper-Level Writing.<ref name=\"1L Requirements\" /> The law school is developing a Transition-to-Practice requirement for students. This new requirement is expected to be fulfilled by taking either a clinical course, or a capstone course. Foundational courses for all areas of legal practice\u2014and thus strongly recommended for all Upper Division students\u2014 include Evidence, Corporations, and Criminal Procedure.\n\nTo respond to increasing demand for specialized legal services, the Law School has developed practice-area concentrations for upper division students in Civil Litigation, Criminal Litigation, Family Law, Intellectual Property, Labor and Employment Law and Securities Regulation.<ref name=\"Programs\">{{cite web|title=Certificate Programs and Concentrations|url=http://www.law.edu/academic/practice-areas/|website=Columbus School of Law|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Degrees offered===\nIn addition to the J.D. program, the school offers [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] programs in Law & Technology, Securities Law, and Comparative and International Law.<ref name=\"LLM\">{{cite web|title=LL.M.

Students can choose to concentrate in the fields of Compliance and Corporate Responsibility, Employment and Human Resources, or Intellectual Property.  Alternatively, students may choose a General U.S. Law option, which provides a broad overview of the law and legal practice.\n\n===Faculty===\nCUA Law had 42 full-time faculty members as of 2013.<ref name=\"509 Info\" /> The school's student-faculty ratio was 10.27 to 1.\n\n===Institutes and programs===\nCUA Law offers five opportunities for specialized legal study; four of them are certificate-granting.<ref name=\"Programs\" />  The programs are designed to give students the opportunity to pursue a specified concentration of courses.

Its first African-American student was enrolled in 1902; its first female student in 1922.\n\nIn 1919, the [[Knights of Columbus]] founded an educational program known as [[History of the Knights of Columbus and The Catholic University  of America#Columbus School of Law|Columbus University]] which provided an evening education program for Catholic war veterans returning from World War I.  This institution was closely affiliated with Catholic University and shared faculty at both institutions' Washington, D.C. locations.\n\nIn 1954 Columbus University (now consisting only of an evening law school) merged with Catholic University's law school to form the Columbus School of Law.  The law school has been accredited by the [[Association of American Law Schools]] since 1921<ref name=\"AALS\">{{cite web|title=AALS Member and Fee-Paid Schools|url=http://www.aals.org/about_memberschools.php|website=AALS|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref> and the [[American Bar Association]] since 1925.<ref name=\"ABA List\">{{cite web|title=Alphabetical School List|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/aba_approved_law_schools/in_alphabetical_order.html|website=ABA|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\n=== Curriculum ===\n[[File:Columbus School of Law CUA.JPG|thumb|235px|Columbus School of Law]]\n\nCatholic University's J.D. program can be completed over three years of full-time day study or four years of part-time evening study.\n\nThe first-year curriculum is prescribed for all students.

Revised for 2013, the new curriculum is designed to strengthen first-year doctrinal courses, to support the development of practice-area concentrations, and to emphasize training that will help graduates transition to the real world of practice.\n\nThe upper-division curriculum comprises several requirements, courses that are strongly recommended, and elective options. CUA Law students must complete a minimum of 84 credits to earn the J.D. degree. Required upper division courses include Constitutional Law II, Professional Responsibility, Professional Skills, and Upper-Level Writing.<ref name=\"1L Requirements\" /> The law school is developing a Transition-to-Practice requirement for students. This new requirement is expected to be fulfilled by taking either a clinical course, or a capstone course. Foundational courses for all areas of legal practice\u2014and thus strongly recommended for all Upper Division students\u2014 include Evidence, Corporations, and Criminal Procedure.\n\nTo respond to increasing demand for specialized legal services, the Law School has developed practice-area concentrations for upper division students in Civil Litigation, Criminal Litigation, Family Law, Intellectual Property, Labor and Employment Law and Securities Regulation.<ref name=\"Programs\">{{cite web|title=Certificate Programs and Concentrations|url=http://www.law.edu/academic/practice-areas/|website=Columbus School of Law|accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Degrees offered===\nIn addition to the J.D. program, the school offers [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] programs in Law & Technology, Securities Law, and Comparative and International Law.<ref name=\"LLM\">{{cite web|title=LL.M.

Students can choose to concentrate in the fields of Compliance and Corporate Responsibility, Employment and Human Resources, or Intellectual Property.  Alternatively, students may choose a General U.S. Law option, which provides a broad overview of the law and legal practice.\n\n===Faculty===\nCUA Law had 42 full-time faculty members as of 2013.<ref name=\"509 Info\" /> The school's student-faculty ratio was 10.27 to 1.\n\n===Institutes and programs===\nCUA Law offers five opportunities for specialized legal study; four of them are certificate-granting.<ref name=\"Programs\" />  The programs are designed to give students the opportunity to pursue a specified concentration of courses.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]) which top UK charts stepping her into fame, \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]). Sia is a type of singer which mainly focuses on the story of survival behind every ounce of pain.\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" which also won the International song of the year award presented by NRJ Music Awards and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\" and is also one of the artist to top the Billboard hot 100 after 40 yrs of age as compared to other emerging artists.The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019. Among the [[List of awards and nominations received by Sia|accolades]] received by Sia are nearly a dozen [[ARIA Awards]], 9 [[Grammy Award]] nominations,  a Rolling Stone Australia Awards and a [[MTV Video Music Award]].<ref name=ARIA2014>{{cite web| url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/40788/Chet-Faker-and-Violent-Soho-lead-20sheeran14-ARIA-nominations|title=Chet Faker and Violent Soholead 2014 ARIA nominations|publisher=fasterlouder|accessdate=5 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===1975\u20131997: Early life and career beginnings===\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in [[Adelaide]], South Australia.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]) which top UK charts stepping her into fame, \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" which also won the International song of the year award presented by NRJ Music Awards and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\" and is also one of the artist to top the Billboard hot 100 after 40 yrs of age as compared to other emerging artists.The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019. Among the [[List of awards and nominations received by Sia|accolades]] received by Sia are nearly a dozen [[ARIA Awards]], 9 [[Grammy Award]] nominations,  a Rolling Stone Australia Awards and a [[MTV Video Music Award]].<ref name=ARIA2014>{{cite web| url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/40788/Chet-Faker-and-Violent-Soho-lead-20sheeran14-ARIA-nominations|title=Chet Faker and Violent Soholead 2014 ARIA nominations|publisher=fasterlouder|accessdate=5 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===1975\u20131997: Early life and career beginnings===\nSia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on 18 December 1975 in [[Adelaide]], South Australia.

Thomas Mangold, Roland R\u00f6hl and Ralf Wochele joined the band shortly afterwards and ''[[Once in a Blue Moon (Fool's Garden album)|Once in a Blue Moon]]'' was released by the complete band in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, the band released ''[[Dish of the Day (album)|Dish of the Day]]'' which gained popularity in Europe and Asia as it included \"[[Lemon Tree (Fool's Garden song)|Lemon Tree]]\", the band's most successful single to date, reaching #1 in Germany and other countries. Following the success of ''Dish of the Day'', the band released three more albums, ''[[Go And Ask Peggy For The Principal Thing]]'' (1997), ''[[For Sale (Fool's Garden album)|For Sale]]'' (2000) and ''[[25 Miles to Kissimmee]]'' (2003) in their original line-up with little commercial success.\n\nFollowing ''25 Miles to Kissimmee'', original members Mangold, R\u00f6hl and Wochele left the band and were replaced by Dirk Bl\u00fcmlein (bassist), Claus M\u00fcller (drummer) and Gabriel Holz (second guitarist and backing vocals). To signify the change, the band decided to remove the [[apostrophe]] from the band name on their next album, ''[[Ready for the Real Life]].'' Despite some critical acclaim, the band's next albums, ''Who Is Jo King?'' (2012) ''and Flashback'' (2015) also were commercial failures. After ''Flashback'', M\u00fcller left the band and was replaced by Jan Hees with Thorsten Kiefer joining as a keyboarder. The band's latest album, ''Rise and Fall'', was released 20 April 2018.\n\nThe band's musical style ranges from [[britpop]] and [[pop rock]], inspired by bands such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Who]], to [[baroque pop]] and [[electronic pop]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation and ''Once in a Blue Moon'' (1991-1993) ===\nIn 1991, Peter Freudenthaler  and his childhood friend Volker Hinkel founded the band in [[Pforzheim]] and recorded their first eponymous promo-album, ''[[Fool's Garden (album)|Fool's Garden]]'', with Freudenthaler and Hinkel sharing vocals and songwriting and Hinkel playing guitar.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.2849478|title=One-Hit-Wonder: Mensch, dieses Lied!|last=Jaeger|first=Mona|date=2014-03-18|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=2018-05-23|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}</ref> ''Fool's Garden'' was self-produced with only five copies ever produced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pz-news.de/kultur_artikel,-Fools-Garden-feiert-25-Jubilaeum-_arid,1123901.html|title=Fools Garden feiert 25.

Released with 1000 copies in 1993, ''Once in a Blue Moon'' mostly consists of re-recordings of songs from ''Fool's Garden''. These albums would remain the only ones featuring Hinkel on vocals. Not signed to a label yet, the album was mainly sold at concerts and sent out to radio stations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== ''Dish of the Day'' and success (1994-1996) ===\nIn 1994, the German branch of fashion retailer [[C&A]] used \"[[Wild Days]]\", the first single from the band's upcoming studio album, ''[[Dish of the Day (album)|Dish of the Day]]'', for a TV commercial.<ref name=\":0\" /> The second single from ''Dish of the Day'', entitled \"[[Lemon Tree (Fool's Garden song)|Lemon Tree]]\", achieved [[Music recording certification|platinum status]] in Germany, New Zealand and Norway and gold status in Austria, Switzerland, France and Sweden. Buoyed by the success of the single, the album's sales increased, achieving platinum status in Germany and Switzerland and gold status in Austria. \"Lemon Tree\" was #1 in the German Single charts for four weeks (23 February to 21 March 1996), the album for the week of 8 to 14 March 1996. Following the success of \"Lemon Tree\", Fools Garden re-released \"Wild Days\" in 1996 but the single only reached #59 in the German and #37 in the Austrian charts.\n\nDespite the fact that the band was already five years old and had released multiple albums, the band received multiple newcomer awards in 1996, such as the [[Bambi Award|Bambi]], the [[Goldene Europa]], the [[Goldene Stimmgabel]] and the [[Echo Music Prize|Echo]].\n\n=== Post-success (1997-2003) ===\nOf 5 September 1997, the band released ''[[Go and Ask Peggy for the Principal Thing]]'', which underperformed in the charts, only reaching #44 in Germany and #50 in Switzerland. The two singles from this album, \"[[Why Did She Go?]]\" and \"[[Probably (Fool's Garden song)|Probably]]\" also failed to reach high positions in the charts. Disillusioned by their brief success, the band titled their next album ''[[For Sale (Fool's Garden album)|For Sale]]'', which was released on 14 April 2000. ''For Sale'' entered the German charts only briefly at #84 for one week while the two singles, \"[[Suzy (Fool's Garden song)|Suzy]]\" and \"It Can Happen\", also made no real impression. The third post-\"Lemon Tree\" album, ''[[25 Miles to Kissimmee]]'', did not even chart.\n\n=== Line-up changes and success in Eastern Europe (2003-2011) ===\nFollowing the commercial failures of their last albums, Mangold, R\u00f6hl and Wochele left the band in 2003, citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.laut.de/Fools-Garden|title=Fool's Garden|last=|first=|date=|work=laut.de|access-date=2018-05-23|language=de-DE}}</ref> When Freudenthaler and Hinkel pitched continuing as a duo, [[Polydor Records]] dropped the band after the release of ''[[25 Miles to Kissimmee]].''

after ''[[Fool's Garden (album)|Fool's Garden]]'', an album recorded by Freudenthaler and Hinkel. Thomas Mangold, Roland R\u00f6hl and Ralf Wochele joined the band shortly afterwards and ''[[Once in a Blue Moon (Fool's Garden album)|Once in a Blue Moon]]'' was released by the complete band in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, the band released ''[[Dish of the Day (album)|Dish of the Day]]'' which gained popularity in Europe and Asia as it included \"[[Lemon Tree (Fool's Garden song)|Lemon Tree]]\", the band's most successful single to date, reaching #1 in Germany and other countries. Following the success of ''Dish of the Day'', the band released three more albums, ''[[Go And Ask Peggy For The Principal Thing]]'' (1997), ''[[For Sale (Fool's Garden album)|For Sale]]'' (2000) and ''[[25 Miles to Kissimmee]]'' (2003) in their original line-up with little commercial success.\n\nFollowing ''25 Miles to Kissimmee'', original members Mangold, R\u00f6hl and Wochele left the band and were replaced by Dirk Bl\u00fcmlein (bassist), Claus M\u00fcller (drummer) and Gabriel Holz (second guitarist and backing vocals). To signify the change, the band decided to remove the [[apostrophe]] from the band name on their next album, ''[[Ready for the Real Life]].'' Despite some critical acclaim, the band's next albums, ''Who Is Jo King?'' (2012) ''and Flashback'' (2015) also were commercial failures. After ''Flashback'', M\u00fcller left the band and was replaced by Jan Hees with Thorsten Kiefer joining as a keyboarder. The band's latest album, ''Rise and Fall'', was released 20 April 2018.\n\nThe band's musical style ranges from [[britpop]] and [[pop rock]], inspired by bands such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Who]], to [[baroque pop]] and [[electronic pop]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation and ''Once in a Blue Moon'' (1991-1993) ===\nIn 1991, Peter Freudenthaler  and his childhood friend Volker Hinkel founded the band in [[Pforzheim]] and recorded their first eponymous promo-album, ''[[Fool's Garden (album)|Fool's Garden]]'', with Freudenthaler and Hinkel sharing vocals and songwriting and Hinkel playing guitar.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.2849478|title=One-Hit-Wonder: Mensch, dieses Lied!|last=Jaeger|first=Mona|date=2014-03-18|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|access-date=2018-05-23|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}</ref> ''Fool's Garden'' was self-produced with only five copies ever produced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pz-news.de/kultur_artikel,-Fools-Garden-feiert-25-Jubilaeum-_arid,1123901.html|title=Fools Garden feiert 25.

Released with 1000 copies in 1993, ''Once in a Blue Moon'' mostly consists of re-recordings of songs from ''Fool's Garden''. These albums would remain the only ones featuring Hinkel on vocals. Not signed to a label yet, the album was mainly sold at concerts and sent out to radio stations.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== ''Dish of the Day'' and success (1994-1996) ===\nIn 1994, the German branch of fashion retailer [[C&A]] used \"[[Wild Days]]\", the first single from the band's upcoming studio album, ''[[Dish of the Day (album)|Dish of the Day]]'', for a TV commercial.<ref name=\":0\" /> The second single from ''Dish of the Day'', entitled \"[[Lemon Tree (Fool's Garden song)|Lemon Tree]]\", achieved [[Music recording certification|platinum status]] in Germany, New Zealand and Norway and gold status in Austria, Switzerland, France and Sweden. Buoyed by the success of the single, the album's sales increased, achieving platinum status in Germany and Switzerland and gold status in Austria. \"Lemon Tree\" was #1 in the German Single charts for four weeks (23 February to 21 March 1996), the album for the week of 8 to 14 March 1996. Following the success of \"Lemon Tree\", Fools Garden re-released \"Wild Days\" in 1996 but the single only reached #59 in the German and #37 in the Austrian charts.\n\nDespite the fact that the band was already five years old and had released multiple albums, the band received multiple newcomer awards in 1996, such as the [[Bambi Award|Bambi]], the [[Goldene Europa]], the [[Goldene Stimmgabel]] and the [[Echo Music Prize|Echo]].\n\n=== Post-success (1997-2003) ===\nOf 5 September 1997, the band released ''[[Go and Ask Peggy for the Principal Thing]]'', which underperformed in the charts, only reaching #44 in Germany and #50 in Switzerland. The two singles from this album, \"[[Why Did She Go?]]\" and \"[[Probably (Fool's Garden song)|Probably]]\" also failed to reach high positions in the charts. Disillusioned by their brief success, the band titled their next album ''[[For Sale (Fool's Garden album)|For Sale]]'', which was released on 14 April 2000. ''For Sale'' entered the German charts only briefly at #84 for one week while the two singles, \"[[Suzy (Fool's Garden song)|Suzy]]\" and \"It Can Happen\", also made no real impression. The third post-\"Lemon Tree\" album, ''[[25 Miles to Kissimmee]]'', did not even chart.\n\n=== Line-up changes and success in Eastern Europe (2003-2011) ===\nFollowing the commercial failures of their last albums, Mangold, R\u00f6hl and Wochele left the band in 2003, citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.laut.de/Fools-Garden|title=Fool's Garden|last=|first=|date=|work=laut.de|access-date=2018-05-23|language=de-DE}}</ref> When Freudenthaler and Hinkel pitched continuing as a duo, [[Polydor Records]] dropped the band after the release of ''[[25 Miles to Kissimmee]].''

In the spring of 1977, street battles between young punks and aging teds happened on London's King's Road, where the earliest new-wave shops, including Westwood and McLaren's ''Sex'' (by now not selling zoot suits and ted gear anymore), were situated.\n\n[[File:Ford.zephyr.six.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ford Zephyr]], a popular vehicle for Teds]]\nIn the late 1980s, there was a move by a number of Teddy Boys to revive the 1950s Teddy Boy style. In the early 1990s, a group of Teddy Boy revivalists in the [[Tottenham]] area of [[north London]] formed \"The Edwardian Drape Society\" (T.E.D.S.). The group concentrated on reclaiming the style which they felt had become bastardised by pop/[[glam rock]] bands such as [[Showaddywaddy]] and [[Mud (band)|Mud]] in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Veness\">{{cite news |last1=Veness |first1=Alison |title=Teddy-boy style is back: it never went away |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/teddy-boy-style-is-back-it-never-went-away-1436250.html |accessdate=7 October 2019 |work=Independent |date=16 May 1994}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayals in popular culture==\n*Early 1950s London gang culture was portrayed in the 1953 film ''[[Cosh Boy]]''.<ref name=\"Kirby\"/>\n*T.E.D.S. was the subject of a short film, ''The Teddy Boys'', by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/lifestyle/stage_screen/news/2006/06/29/d7c45d52-e42e-4f5a-8aa1-ad29f428f788.lpf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916112827/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/lifestyle/stage_screen/news/2006/06/29/d7c45d52-e42e-4f5a-8aa1-ad29f428f788.lpf|title=CEN Lifestyle : Stage and Screen :  Things to see at the 26th Cambridge Film Festival|archivedate=16 September 2006|work=cambridge-news.co.uk}}</ref>\n*Characters in the 2019 video game ''Sayonara Wild Hearts'' wear Teddy Girl-inspired clothing.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n*Episode 6 in season 4 of British TV series ''[[Grantchester (TV series)|Grantchester]]''.\n* The Teddy Boy subculture is explored in the 2020 film ''[[Dandilicious]]'', which tells the story of a Teddy Boy in 1959.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- please keep alphabetical -->\n* [[Beatnik]]\n*[[Bodgies and widgies]], a similar subculture in Australia and New Zealand\n* [[Greaser (subculture)|Greasers]], a similar subculture in the United States\n*[[Mods and rockers]]\n* [[Ned (Scottish)]] subculture said to predate and overlap with Teddy Boys\n* [[Raggare]], a similar subculture in Sweden\n* [[Rocker (subculture)]]\n* [[Stilyagi]], a similar subculture in Soviet Russia\n\n<!-- please keep alphabetical -->\n{{Portal bar|United Kingdom|1950s}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.edwardianteddyboy.com/ The Edwardian Teddy Boy].\n*[http://www.storyvault.com/video/view/postwar_london An account of being a Teddy Girl in 1950s London.
