It begins on the southern edge of [[Leeds city centre]] and mainly lies in the [[LS postcode area|LS11 postcode district]]. The [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M621 motorway]]s used to end/begin in Holbeck. Now the M621 is the only motorway that passes through the area since the end of the M1 moved to Hook Moor near [[Aberford]]. Since large parts of Holbeck have been vacated in preparation for the regeneration of the area, the district has in large parts suffered from a population exodus. Holbeck had a population of 5,505 in 2011.<ref>Holbeck is made up of 21 Output areas in the Beeston and Holbeck ward http://ukcensusdata.com/beeston-and-holbeck-e05001415#sthash.izecXSHH.dpbs</ref><ref>Holbeck is also made up of 2 output areas in the City and Hunslet ward in the centre of Leeds http://ukcensusdata.com/city-and-hunslet-e05001420#sthash.uqs192IK.dpbs</ref> The district currently falls within the [[Beeston and Holbeck (ward)|Beeston and Holbeck]] ward of [[Leeds City Council]].\n\nThe [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] also runs through Holbeck.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Temple Works.jpg|thumb|left|[[Temple Works]]]]\n[[File:JMWTurner Leeds detail of Holbeck.png|thumb|Detail of J.

The most notable scheme is the [[Holbeck Urban Village]], which is expected to attract investment of around \u00a3800&nbsp;million and create around 5,000 jobs. However, the area surrounding the 'Village' is deprived and run down. From 2007, [[Leeds City Council]] began vacating the [[back-to-back houses|back-to-back]] housing and in 2010 began demolition. \n\nThe main area of demolition during the regeneration was the Jenkinson Estate. Many low-rise flat blocks were demolished and the remaining housing received new UPVC windows, new roofing & external covering. The land where the low-rise flat blocks were has been used for brand-new social housing including 4 Bedroom Family Homes to 2 Bedroom Apartments.\n\nThree rows of back-to-back terraced homes on Brown Lane-West and Top Moor Side have been demolished and made way for some more social housing, built by Keepmoat. In July 2017, residents had noticed some of the council-owned back-to-back terraced homes are being renovated with new windows and roofing.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:The Old Library, Holbeck. - geograph.org.uk - 112621.jpg|thumb|The Old Library, Holbeck.]]\nHolbeck Conservation Area includes several industrial archaeological sites and Listed buildings. Holbeck is unique in Leeds as an area where many early to mid 19th century industrial buildings survive in an unaltered group within the original street pattern. The buildings are utilitarian two or three-storey brick structures with some larger complexes such as Temple Mill and the brick [[terracotta]] towers of Tower Works.

It became inadequate for the rapidly increasing population at that time and was demolished in 1836. The church of St. Matthew was built on common land next to the old burial-ground. It cost \u00a33,786 and was a [[Commissioners' church]] built by the Parliamentary Commissioners and consecrated in 1832. It is built in the early English style. There were places of worship for Independents, [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]] and other denominations.<ref name=tde/>\nCurrently the groups that meet in Holbeck include the Holbeck Christian Fellowship and Mosaic Church, which is found on Sweet Street in a warehouse opposite the Commercial pub and has been in Holbeck since early 2008. Over the last few years several of Mosaic's Church attendees have moved into Holbeck.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe area has lost amenities as part of the population exodus connected with the demolition of properties as part of the regeneration scheme. [[Kwik Save]] supermarket closed in 2005, leaving small independent convenience stores. The [[post office]] closed in 2008, but reopened in 2009. There is a bookmaker and several fast food takeaways.\n\n==Managed Approach to on street prostitution==\nIn 2014 Leeds Council in conjunction with West Yorkshire Police trialled a managed approach to prostitution&nbsp;which allows for soliciting and purchasing of sex in a light industrial area in a bid to:\n\n* To reduce the problems caused by street prostitution to residents, and businesses which currently suffer from such nuisance;\n* To better engage with street sex workers to improve their safety and health, with a view to enabling them to exit this way of life\n* Reduce the prevalence of street sex working.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.leeds.gov.uk/saferleeds/managed-approach|title=Safer Leeds Managed Approach|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref> \n\nAfter a review in 2016 it was announced that this was to continue indefinitely.<ref name=\"YEP2016\">[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/exclusive-legal-red-light-zone-here-to-stay-in-leeds-1-8040960 ''Yorkshire Evening Post''] 29 July 2016 \"Exclusive: \u2018Legal red light zone\u2019 here to stay in Leeds\"</ref>  The activities here are featured in the 2016-17 [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Sex, Drugs & Murder: Life in the Red Light Zone]]''. \n\n==Notable residents==\n* [[Stephen Scholey]] (1815-78), settler of Australia.\n* [[Henry Rowland Marsden]] (1823-76), mayor of Leeds.\n* [[John Scholey]] (1840-1908), businessman.\n* [[Joseph Blackburn (cricketer)|Joseph Blackburn]] (1852-1922), cricketer.\n* [[Thomas Walker (Yorkshire cricketer)|Thomas Walker]] (1854-1925), cricketer.\n* [[Ted Peate]] (1855-1900), cricketer.\n* [[David Eccles Nichols]] (1873-1962), violinist, born in Holbeck.\n* [[Alexander Tom Cussons]] (1875-1951), industrialist.\n* [[Frank Dennis]] (1907-2000), cricketer.\n* [[Stan Brogden]] (1910-81), athlete.\n* [[Ivy Benson]] (1913-93), bandleader.\n* [[Hasib Hussain]] (1986-2005), terrorist.\n\n==Documentaries and histories==\n\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2006/05/26/mini_guide_holbeck_feature.shtml Where I Live - Holbeck BBC Leeds Mini Guides]\n*{{Genuki|county=WRY|Leeds||Holbeck}}\n* ''Ripples Out'' (Lippy People, 2009), a documentary about the area and its redevelopment, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp_JK85Y8wM part 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vyF-K5l-48 part 2], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXfjio54iWs part 3], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqVmcV3pkFU part 4], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep47KAFki1k part 5], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYiU9GoVSPI part 6], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJHng_lngJc part 7], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzSahUhq-_M part 8], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH-Qsg7ut3k part 9], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPzX3PAJNRg part 10], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYme_AnrS6s part 11].\n* Blackshaw, Tony, ''Working-Class Life in Northern England, 1945-2010: The Pre-History and Afterlife of the Inbetweener Generation'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).\n* {{Cite Book|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/28316/1/SCBradleyRevisedPhD.pdf|title=Archaeology of the Voice: Exploring Oral History, Locative Media, Audio Walks, and Sound Art as Sitespecific Displacement Activities|last=Bradley|first=Simon|publisher=Unpublished PhD thesis|year=2016|isbn=|location=University of Huddersfield|pages=31}}\n* Bradley, Simon and Phil Legard, ''Holbeck Audiowalk'', http://www.holbeckaudiowalk.org/.\n* Miller, K.

The most notable scheme is the [[Holbeck Urban Village]], which is expected to attract investment of around \u00a3800&nbsp;million and create around 5,000 jobs. However, the area surrounding the 'Village' is deprived and run down. From 2007, [[Leeds City Council]] began vacating the [[back-to-back houses|back-to-back]] housing and in 2010 began demolition. \n\nThe main area of demolition during the regeneration was the Jenkinson Estate. Many low-rise flat blocks were demolished and the remaining housing received new UPVC windows, new roofing & external covering. The land where the low-rise flat blocks were has been used for brand-new social housing including 4 Bedroom Family Homes to 2 Bedroom Apartments.\n\nThree rows of back-to-back terraced homes on Brown Lane-West and Top Moor Side have been demolished and made way for some more social housing, built by Keepmoat. In July 2017, residents had noticed some of the council-owned back-to-back terraced homes are being renovated with new windows and roofing.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:The Old Library, Holbeck. - geograph.org.uk - 112621.jpg|thumb|The Old Library, Holbeck.]]\nHolbeck Conservation Area includes several industrial archaeological sites and Listed buildings. Holbeck is unique in Leeds as an area where many early to mid 19th century industrial buildings survive in an unaltered group within the original street pattern. The buildings are utilitarian two or three-storey brick structures with some larger complexes such as Temple Mill and the brick [[terracotta]] towers of Tower Works.

It became inadequate for the rapidly increasing population at that time and was demolished in 1836. The church of St. Matthew was built on common land next to the old burial-ground. It cost \u00a33,786 and was a [[Commissioners' church]] built by the Parliamentary Commissioners and consecrated in 1832. It is built in the early English style. There were places of worship for Independents, [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyans]] and other denominations.<ref name=tde/>\nCurrently the groups that meet in Holbeck include the Holbeck Christian Fellowship and Mosaic Church, which is found on Sweet Street in a warehouse opposite the Commercial pub and has been in Holbeck since early 2008. Over the last few years several of Mosaic's Church attendees have moved into Holbeck.\n\n==Amenities==\nThe area has lost amenities as part of the population exodus connected with the demolition of properties as part of the regeneration scheme. [[Kwik Save]] supermarket closed in 2005, leaving small independent convenience stores. The [[post office]] closed in 2008, but reopened in 2009. There is a bookmaker and several fast food takeaways.\n\n==Managed Approach to on street prostitution==\nIn 2014 Leeds Council in conjunction with West Yorkshire Police trialled a managed approach to prostitution&nbsp;which allows for soliciting and purchasing of sex in a light industrial area in a bid to:\n\n* To reduce the problems caused by street prostitution to residents, and businesses which currently suffer from such nuisance;\n* To better engage with street sex workers to improve their safety and health, with a view to enabling them to exit this way of life\n* Reduce the prevalence of street sex working.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.leeds.gov.uk/saferleeds/managed-approach|title=Safer Leeds Managed Approach|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref> \n\nAfter a review in 2016 it was announced that this was to continue indefinitely.<ref name=\"YEP2016\">[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/exclusive-legal-red-light-zone-here-to-stay-in-leeds-1-8040960 ''Yorkshire Evening Post''] 29 July 2016 \"Exclusive: \u2018Legal red light zone\u2019 here to stay in Leeds\"</ref>  The activities here are featured in the 2016-17 [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Sex, Drugs & Murder: Life in the Red Light Zone]]''. \n\n==Notable residents==\n* [[Stephen Scholey]] (1815-78), settler of Australia.\n* [[Henry Rowland Marsden]] (1823-76), mayor of Leeds.\n* [[John Scholey]] (1840-1908), businessman.\n* [[Joseph Blackburn (cricketer)|Joseph Blackburn]] (1852-1922), cricketer.\n* [[Thomas Walker (Yorkshire cricketer)|Thomas Walker]] (1854-1925), cricketer.\n* [[Ted Peate]] (1855-1900), cricketer.\n* [[David Eccles Nichols]] (1873-1962), violinist, born in Holbeck.\n* [[Alexander Tom Cussons]] (1875-1951), industrialist.\n* [[Frank Dennis]] (1907-2000), cricketer.\n* [[Stan Brogden]] (1910-81), athlete.\n* [[Ivy Benson]] (1913-93), bandleader.\n* [[Hasib Hussain]] (1986-2005), terrorist.\n\n==Documentaries and histories==\n\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2006/05/26/mini_guide_holbeck_feature.shtml Where I Live - Holbeck BBC Leeds Mini Guides]\n*{{Genuki|county=WRY|Leeds||Holbeck}}\n* ''Ripples Out'' (Lippy People, 2009), a documentary about the area and its redevelopment, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp_JK85Y8wM part 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vyF-K5l-48 part 2], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXfjio54iWs part 3], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqVmcV3pkFU part 4], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep47KAFki1k part 5], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYiU9GoVSPI part 6], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJHng_lngJc part 7], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzSahUhq-_M part 8], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH-Qsg7ut3k part 9], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPzX3PAJNRg part 10], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYme_AnrS6s part 11].\n* Blackshaw, Tony, ''Working-Class Life in Northern England, 1945-2010: The Pre-History and Afterlife of the Inbetweener Generation'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).\n* {{Cite Book|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/28316/1/SCBradleyRevisedPhD.pdf|title=Archaeology of the Voice: Exploring Oral History, Locative Media, Audio Walks, and Sound Art as Sitespecific Displacement Activities|last=Bradley|first=Simon|publisher=Unpublished PhD thesis|year=2016|isbn=|location=University of Huddersfield|pages=31}}\n* Bradley, Simon and Phil Legard, ''Holbeck Audiowalk'', http://www.holbeckaudiowalk.org/.\n* Miller, K.

Two brass rings Chapman is known to have worn were not recovered at the crime scene, either because she had [[Pawnbroker|pawned]] them or because they had been stolen.<ref>Fido, pp. 31\u201332</ref> All the pawnbrokers in the area were searched for the rings without success.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\">Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69</ref> The envelope bore the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]], and was briefly believed could be traced to Edward Stanley, who is known to have falsely claimed to be an army veteran, in receipt of a pension. This lead of enquiry was abandoned after police discovered Chapman had wrapped the pills in this section of envelope at Crossingham's Lodging House just hours before her murder.<ref>Fido, p. 32</ref>\n\nContemporary press reports claimed that two [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s were also found in the yard of Hanbury Street, but these coins are not mentioned in the surviving police records.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\"/> The local inspector of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division Whitechapel, was reported as mentioning these coins at an inquest in 1889, and the acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, also mentioned them in his memoirs.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/> Smith's memoirs, however, are unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect, and were written more than twenty years after the event.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> Smith claimed medical students frequently polished farthings so they could be passed off as [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to unsuspecting prostitutes, and so the presence of the farthings suggested the culprit may have been a medical student. However, the price to solicit the services of an East End prostitute was as little as [[Fourpence (British coin)|4d]]\u2014much less than a sovereign.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/>\n[[File:Bagsterphillips2.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Illustrated Police News]]'' sketch of Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]] examining the body of Annie Chapman at 29 Hanbury Street]]\nThe first officer on the scene was inspector Joseph Luniss Chandler of H Division, but Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] of [[Scotland Yard]] was placed in overall command on 15 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 69, 85</ref> The murder was quickly linked to similar murders in the district, particularly to that of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] a week previously. Nichols had also suffered a slash to the throat and abdominal wounds, and a blade of similar size and design had been used. Swanson reported that an \"immediate and searching enquiry was made at all common lodging-houses to ascertain if anyone had entered that morning with blood on his hands or clothes, or under any suspicious circumstances\".<ref>Report of Superintendent Swanson, 19 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 68</ref> The body was conveyed later that day to Whitechapel mortuary in the same police ambulance, which was a handcart just large enough for one coffin, used for Nichols by Sergeant [[Edward Badham]].<ref>Marriott, p. 46</ref> Badham was the first to testify at the subsequent inquest.\n\n=== Inquest ===\nThe inquest was opened on 10 September at the Working Lad's Institute, Whitechapel, by local coroner [[Wynne Edwin Baxter]]. Evidence indicated that Chapman may have been killed as late as 5:30 a.m., in the enclosed back yard of a house occupied by sixteen people,<!--There were 17 residents but one was out at the time of the murder (Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 76)--> none of whom had seen or heard anything at the time of the murder.<ref>Coroner Baxter quoted in Marriott, p. 71</ref> The passage through the house to the back-yard was not locked, as it was frequented by the residents at all hours of the day, and the front door was wide open when the body was discovered.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 71</ref> Richardson said that he had often seen strangers, both men and women, in the passage of the house.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 78</ref> Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]], the police surgeon, described the body as he saw it at 6:30 a.m. in the back yard of the house at 29 Hanbury Street:\n{{quote|text=The left arm was placed across the left breast. The legs were drawn up, the feet resting on the ground, and the knees turned outwards. The face was swollen and turned on the right side. The tongue protruded between the front teeth, but not beyond the lips. The tongue was evidently much swollen. The front teeth were perfect as far as the first molar, top and bottom and very fine teeth they were. The body was terribly mutilated&nbsp;... the stiffness of the limbs was not marked, but was evidently commencing. He noticed that the throat was dissevered deeply; that the incision through the skin were jagged and reached right round the neck&nbsp;... On the wooden [[Palisade|paling]] between the yard in question and the next, smears of blood, corresponding to where the head of the deceased lay, were to be seen. These were about 14 inches from the ground, and immediately above the part where the blood from the neck lay.&nbsp;...\n\nThe instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge&nbsp;... he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence&nbsp;... of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive&nbsp;...\n\nA handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning.

He claimed that he had been bitten by a woman, and the blood was his.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 83</ref> He was investigated, cleared and released.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 89</ref> Swiss butcher Jacob Isenschmidt matched the description of a blood-stained man seen acting strangely on the morning of the murder by a public house landlady, Mrs Fiddymont. His distinctive appearance included a large ginger moustache, and he had a history of mental illness. He was detained in a mental asylum. German hairdresser Charles Ludwig was arrested after he attempted to stab a man at a coffee stall shortly after attacking a prostitute. Isenschmidt and Ludwig were exonerated after another murder was committed while they were in custody.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Other suspects named in the police files and contemporary newspapers include Friedrich Schumacher, pedlar Edward McKenna, apothecary and mental patient Oswald Puckridge, and insane medical student John Sanders, but there was no evidence against any of them.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 80, 84, 88</ref>\n\nEdward Stanley was eliminated as a suspect as his alibis for the nights of two of the murders were confirmed.

She was the first of five children born to George Smith, and Ruth Chapman. George Smith was a soldier, having enlisted in the 2nd Regiment [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] in December 1834. Chapman's parents were not married at the time of her birth, although they married on 22 February 1842, in Paddington. Following the birth of their second child in 1844, the family relocated to [[Knightsbridge]], where George Smith became a [[valet]].<ref>''Serial Killers and the Phenomenon of Serial Murder: A Student Textbook'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-97621-4}} p. 73</ref> The family eventually relocated to [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in 1856.<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 63</ref>\n\n[[Census]] records from 1861 indicate all members of the Smith family\u2014except Annie\u2014had relocated to the parish of [[Clewer]]. Chapman is believed to have remained in London, possibly due to her employment commitments as a domestic servant.

The marriage was witnessed by one of her sisters, Emily Laticia, and a colleague of her husband named George White.<ref name=shelden>'Annie Chapman: Jack the Ripper Victim A Short Biography'. Written and published by Neal Shelden (2001)</ref> Initially, the couple resided in Montpelier Place, [[Brompton, London|Brompton]], although in the years following their marriage, the Chapmans lived at various [[West London]] addresses. The couple had three children: Emily Ruth (b. 25 June 1870); Annie Georgina (b. 5 June 1873); and John Alfred (b. 21 November 1880). Emily Ruth was born at Chapman's mother's home in Monpelier Place, Knightsbridge; Annie Georgina was born at South Bruton Mews, [[Mayfair]]; and John Alfred was born in the [[Berkshire]] village of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]].<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Facts'' {{ISBN|978-1-909-39615-9}} ch. 6</ref> John was born [[cripple]]d,<ref>''Revelations of the True Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-411-69741-6}} p. 25</ref> leadng the Chapmans to seek medical help for their son at a London hospital before later placing him in the care of an institution for the physically disabled. Although Chapman had struggled with [[alcoholism]] as an adult, she had reportedly weaned herself off drink by 1880. Her son's disability is believed to have contributed to Chapman's reversion to [[alcohol dependency]].<ref>''London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City'' {{ISBN|978-6-612-82171-4}} p. 163</ref>\n[[File:EmilyRuthChapmanAnnieChapmanDaughterc.1879a.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Emily Ruth Chapman.

The following year, Emily Ruth Chapman died of [[meningitis]] on her brother's second birthday at the age of 12.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia p29\" />\n\nFollowing the death of their daughter, both Chapman and her husband took to heavy drinking.<ref>''London's Shadows: The Dark Side of the Victorian City'' {{ISBN|978-6-612-82171-4}} p. 163</ref> Over the following years, she is known to have been arrested on several occasions for [[public intoxication]] in both Clewer and Windsor.<ref>''Complete Jack The Ripper'' {{ISBN|0-14-017395-1}} p. 39</ref> The couple separated by mutual consent in 1884,<ref name=shelden/> with John Chapman being obliged to pay his wife a weekly allowance of 10[[Shilling|s]] via Post Office Order.

However, at the end of 1886, these payments abruptly stopped. Upon enquiring why these weekly payments had suddenly ceased, Chapman discovered her husband had died of alcohol-related causes. Shortly thereafter\u2014possibly due to the cessation of Chapman's inheritance\u2014this sieve-maker left Chapman. One of her friends later testified Chapman had subsequently become very [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and generally seemed to abandon the [[Volition (psychology)|will]] to live.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/jack-the-ripper/crimes|title=The Man Who Shook a City|website=crimeandinvestigation.co.uk|accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of Chapman's death, her son John had been placed in the care of an institution for the physically disabled.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: From the Cradle to the Grave'' {{ISBN|978-1-481-79895-2}} p. 114</ref> Her surviving daughter, Annie Georgina, then an adolescent, was travelling with a circus in France.<ref name=shelden/>\n\n==1888==\nBy May or June of 1888, Chapman resided in Crossingham's Lodging House at 35 [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]],<ref>''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'' {{ISBN|0-582-50631-X}} p. 188</ref> paying 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] a night for a double bed.

The two had stood just beyond the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], Spitalfields. Mrs. Long described the man as being over forty years of age, slightly taller than Chapman, with dark hair, and of a foreign, \"shabby-[[Gentry|genteel]]\" appearance.<ref name=begg153/> He was wearing a [[Deerstalker|deer-stalker hat]] and dark overcoat.<ref name=begg153>Begg, p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59\u201375</ref> If Elizabeth Long was correct with regards to her identification of Chapman and the description of the individual in her company at the time of this sighting, it is likely she was the last person to see Chapman alive, and in the company of her murderer.<ref>''The Real Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-845-29182-2}} p. 369</ref>\n\n===Murder===\nShortly before 5:00&nbsp;a.m. on 8 September, the son of a resident of 29 Hanbury Street, John Richardson, entered the back yard of the property to trim a loose piece of leather from his boot.

Two brass rings Chapman is known to have worn were not recovered at the crime scene, either because she had [[Pawnbroker|pawned]] them or because they had been stolen.<ref>Fido, pp. 31\u201332</ref> All the pawnbrokers in the area were searched for the rings without success.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\">Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69</ref> The envelope bore the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]], and was briefly believed could be traced to Edward Stanley, who is known to have falsely claimed to be an army veteran, in receipt of a pension. This lead of enquiry was abandoned after police discovered Chapman had wrapped the pills in this section of envelope at Crossingham's Lodging House just hours before her murder.<ref>Fido, p. 32</ref>\n\nContemporary press reports claimed that two [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s were also found in the yard of Hanbury Street, but these coins are not mentioned in the surviving police records.<ref name=\"Evans and Rumbelow, p. 69\"/> The local inspector of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], [[Edmund Reid]] of H Division Whitechapel, was reported as mentioning these coins at an inquest in 1889, and the acting Commissioner of the City Police, Major Henry Smith, also mentioned them in his memoirs.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/> Smith's memoirs, however, are unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect, and were written more than twenty years after the event.<ref>Fido, pp. 50, 120</ref> Smith claimed medical students frequently polished farthings so they could be passed off as [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereigns]] to unsuspecting prostitutes, and so the presence of the farthings suggested the culprit may have been a medical student. However, the price to solicit the services of an East End prostitute was as little as [[Fourpence (British coin)|4d]]\u2014much less than a sovereign.<ref name=\"Fido, p. 31\"/>\n[[File:Bagsterphillips2.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Illustrated Police News]]'' sketch of Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]] examining the body of Annie Chapman at 29 Hanbury Street]]\nThe first officer on the scene was inspector Joseph Luniss Chandler of H Division, but Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] of [[Scotland Yard]] was placed in overall command on 15 September.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 69, 85</ref> The murder was quickly linked to similar murders in the district, particularly to that of [[Mary Ann Nichols]] a week previously. Nichols had also suffered a slash to the throat and abdominal wounds, and a blade of similar size and design had been used.

Evidence indicated that Chapman may have been killed as late as 5:30 a.m., in the enclosed back yard of a house occupied by sixteen people,<!--There were 17 residents but one was out at the time of the murder (Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 76)--> none of whom had seen or heard anything at the time of the murder.<ref>Coroner Baxter quoted in Marriott, p. 71</ref> The passage through the house to the back-yard was not locked, as it was frequented by the residents at all hours of the day, and the front door was wide open when the body was discovered.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 71</ref> Richardson said that he had often seen strangers, both men and women, in the passage of the house.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 78</ref> Dr [[George Bagster Phillips]], the police surgeon, described the body as he saw it at 6:30 a.m. in the back yard of the house at 29 Hanbury Street:\n{{quote|text=The left arm was placed across the left breast. The legs were drawn up, the feet resting on the ground, and the knees turned outwards. The face was swollen and turned on the right side. The tongue protruded between the front teeth, but not beyond the lips. The tongue was evidently much swollen. The front teeth were perfect as far as the first molar, top and bottom and very fine teeth they were. The body was terribly mutilated&nbsp;... the stiffness of the limbs was not marked, but was evidently commencing. He noticed that the throat was dissevered deeply; that the incision through the skin were jagged and reached right round the neck&nbsp;... On the wooden [[Palisade|paling]] between the yard in question and the next, smears of blood, corresponding to where the head of the deceased lay, were to be seen. These were about 14 inches from the ground, and immediately above the part where the blood from the neck lay.&nbsp;...\n\nThe instrument used at the throat and abdomen was the same. It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the slaughtermen, well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge&nbsp;... he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence&nbsp;... of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive&nbsp;...\n\nA handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning. He should say it was not tied on after the throat was cut.<ref>''The Times'', 14 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 85\u201388</ref>}}\n[[File:Annie Chapman mortuary photo.jpg|thumb|160px|Mortuary photograph of Annie Chapman]]\nChapman's throat had been cut from left to right so deeply the bones of her [[vertebral column]] bore striations,<ref>''Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-848-68522-2}} p. 158</ref> and she had been [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]], with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh\u2014plus her [[small intestine]]s\u2014being removed and placed above her right shoulder.<ref>''The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970'' {{ISBN|978-0-863-79040-9}} pp. 55-56</ref> The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. Chapman's protruding tongue and swollen face led Dr Phillips to think that she may have been asphyxiated with the handkerchief around her neck before her throat was cut.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 72; Fido, p. 34</ref> As there was no blood trail leading to the yard, he was certain that she was killed where she was found. He concluded that she suffered from a long-standing lung disease, that the victim was sober at the time of death, and had not consumed alcoholic beverages for at least some hours before it.<ref>Phillips's inquest testimony quoted in Marriott, pp. 53\u201354</ref> Phillips was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6\u20138&nbsp;inches (15\u201320&nbsp;cm) long.<ref>Cook, p. 221; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 71\u201372; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 67\u201368, 87; Marriott, pp. 26\u201329; Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts.<ref>Fido, p. 35; Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> As her body was not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organ was removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could then sell as surgical specimens.<ref>Marriott, pp. 77\u201379</ref> In his summing up, Coroner Baxter raised the possibility that Chapman was murdered deliberately to obtain the uterus, on the basis that an American had made enquiries at a London medical school for the purchase of such organs.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 89; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 106; Fido, p. 35; Marriott, p. 73</ref> ''[[The Lancet]]'' rejected Baxter's suggestion scathingly, pointed out \"certain improbabilities and absurdities\", and said it was \"a grave error of judgement\".<ref>''The Lancet'', 29 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 89\u201390</ref> The ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' was similarly dismissive, and reported that the physician who requested the samples was a highly reputable doctor, unnamed, who had left the country 18 months before the murder.<ref>''British Medical Journal'', 6 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 92 and Fido, p. 36</ref> Baxter dropped the theory and never referred to it again.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 90; Fido, p. 36</ref> The ''Chicago Tribune'' claimed the American doctor was from Philadelphia,<ref>''Chicago Tribune'', 7 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 93</ref> and author [[Philip Sugden (historian)|Philip Sugden]] later speculated that the man in question was the notorious [[Francis Tumblety]].<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 93</ref>\n\nDr Phillips's estimate of the time of death (4:30 a.m. or before) contradicted the testimony of the witnesses Richardson, Long and Cadosch, which placed the murder later. Victorian methods of estimating time of death, such as measuring body temperature, were crude, and Phillips highlighted at the inquest that the body could have cooled more quickly than normally expected.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 73\u201374</ref>\n[[File:Wanted poster.jpg|160px|thumb|right|alt=Ghastly murder in the East End.

Ship's cook William Henry Piggott was detained after being found in possession of a blood-stained shirt while making misogynist remarks. He claimed that he had been bitten by a woman, and the blood was his.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 83</ref> He was investigated, cleared and released.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 89</ref> Swiss butcher Jacob Isenschmidt matched the description of a blood-stained man seen acting strangely on the morning of the murder by a public house landlady, Mrs Fiddymont. His distinctive appearance included a large ginger moustache, and he had a history of mental illness. He was detained in a mental asylum. German hairdresser Charles Ludwig was arrested after he attempted to stab a man at a coffee stall shortly after attacking a prostitute. Isenschmidt and Ludwig were exonerated after another murder was committed while they were in custody.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Other suspects named in the police files and contemporary newspapers include Friedrich Schumacher, pedlar Edward McKenna, apothecary and mental patient Oswald Puckridge, and insane medical student John Sanders, but there was no evidence against any of them.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 80, 84, 88</ref>\n\nEdward Stanley was eliminated as a suspect as his alibis for the nights of two of the murders were confirmed. On 30\u201331 August, when Mary Ann Nichols was killed, he was on duty with the Hampshire militia in [[Gosport]], and on the night of Chapman's murder he was at his lodgings.<ref>Report by Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], 19 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 64</ref>\n\n==Funeral==\nAnnie Chapman was buried shortly after 9:00 a.m. on 14 September 1888 in a service paid for by her family. She was laid to rest in a communal grave within Manor Park Cemetery, [[Forest Gate]], east London. At the request of Chapman's family, the funeral was not publicised, with no mourning [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] used throughout the service, and only the [[undertaker]], police, and her relatives knowing of these arrangements. Resultingly, her family members were the only mourners to attend the service.<ref>''Ripper Notes: Death in London's East End'' {{ISBN|978-0-975-91295-9}} p. 94</ref>\n\nA hearse supplied by Hanbury Street undertaker H. Smith travelled to the Whitechapel Mortuary in Montague Street to collect Chapman's body at 7:00 a.m. Her body was placed in an [[elm]] coffin draped in black and was then driven to a Spitalfields undertaker named Harry Hawes, who arranged the funeral. Chapman's relatives met the hearse outside the cemetery. Her coffin bore the words \"Annie Chapman, died Sept. 8, 1888, aged 48 years.\"<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', 15 September 1888, p. 3</ref>\n\nThe grave of Annie Chapman no longer exists. The location has since been buried over.

She lived in England, in the cities of Bristol and London; she also lived for a time in France and Germany. She enjoyed poetry from the age of seven and started working, first as a teacher and then as actress, from the age of fourteen. She wrote many plays, poems and novels. She was a celebrity, gossiped about in newspapers, famous for her acting and writing .  During her lifetime she was known as \"the English Sappho\".<ref>Mary Robinson, Sappho and Phaon, About the Book</ref><ref>Judith Pascoe, Romantic Theatricality, Cornell University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8014-3304-5}}, p.13</ref> She earned her nickname \"Perdita\" for her role as [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] (heroine of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'') in 1779. She was the first public mistress of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] while he was still Prince of Wales.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRobinson was born in [[Bristol]], England to Nicholas Darby, a [[captain (naval)|naval captain]], and his wife Hester (n\u00e9e Vanacott) who had married at Donyatt, Somerset, in 1749, and was baptised 'Polle(y)' (\"Spelt 'Polle' in the official register and 'Polly' in the Bishop's Transcript\") at St Augustine's Church, Bristol, 19 July 1758,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perdita : the life of Mary Robinson|last=Paula.|first=Byrne|date=2005|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0007164592|location=London|oclc=224036999}}</ref> the entry noting that she was born 27 November 1756.<ref>Anthony Camp, ''Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction: 1714-1936'' (2007) 133-34.</ref> In her memoirs,<ref>Her daughter Mary Elizabeth, honoring her mother's request, published a draft of Robinson's memoirs in 1801 as ''Memoirs, with some Posthumous Pieces'',</ref> Robinson gives her birth in 1758 but the year 1757 seems more likely according to recently published research (see appendix to Byrne, 2005). Her father deserted her mother and took on a mistress when Robinson was still a child. The family hoped for a reconciliation, but Captain Darby made it clear that this was not going to happen. Without the support of her husband, Hester Darby supported herself and the five children born of the marriage by starting a school for young girls in [[Little Chelsea]], [[London]], (where Robinson taught by her 14th birthday).{{sfn|Levy|2004}} However, during one of his brief returns to the family, Captain Darby had the school closed<ref>Feldman, p. 590</ref> (which he was entitled to do by English law). Darby died in the Russian naval service in 1785. Robinson, who at one point attended a school run by the social reformer [[Hannah More]], came to the attention of actor [[David Garrick]].\n\n===Marriage===\nHester Darby encouraged her daughter to accept the proposal of an [[articled clerk]], Thomas Robinson, who claimed to have an inheritance. Mary was against this idea; however, after being stricken ill, and watching him take care of her and her younger brother, she felt that she owed him, and she did not want to disappoint her mother who was pushing for the engagement. After the early marriage, Robinson discovered that her husband did not have an inheritance. He continued to live an elaborate lifestyle, however, and had multiple affairs that he made no effort to hide. Subsequently, Mary supported their family. After her husband squandered their money, the couple fled to [[Talgarth]], [[Breconshire]] (where Robinson's only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was born in November). Here they lived in a fairly large estate, called Tregunter Park. Eventually her husband was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison where she lived with him for many months. While it was common for the wives of prisoners to live with their husbands while indebted, children were usually sent to live with relatives to keep them away from the dangers of prison. However, Robinson was deeply devoted to her daughter Maria, and when her husband was imprisoned, Robinson brought the 6-month-old baby with her.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson|last=Byrne|first=Paula|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=56}}</ref> \n\nIt was in the Fleet Prison that Robinson's literary career really began, as she found that she could publish poetry to earn money, and to give her an escape from the harsh reality that had become her life. Her first book, ''Poems By Mrs. Robinson'', was published in 1775 by C. Parker.<ref name=\"Runge\">{{Cite web |url=http://chuma.cas.usf.edu/~runge/MRobinson.htm |title=Mary Darby Robinson (1758?-1800) - Bibliography |last=Runge |first=Laura L. |date=September 21, 2001 |access-date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, Darby was offered work in the form of copying legal documents so he could try to pay back some of his debts, but he refused to do anything. Robinson, in an effort to keep the family together and to get back to normal life outside of prison, took the job instead, collecting the pay that her husband neglected to earn.<ref name=\":5\" /> During this time, Mary Robinson found a patron in [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]], who sponsored the publication of Robinson's second volume of poems, ''Captivity.''\n\n===Theatre===\n[[File:Florizel and Perdita 1783.jpg|thumb|[[Caricature]] of the Prince of Wales as [[Florizel (The Winter's Tale)|Florizel]] and Mary Robinson as [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]], 1783]]\n\nAfter her husband obtained his release from prison, Robinson decided to return to the theatre. She launched her acting career and took to the stage, playing Juliet, at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] in December 1776. Robinson was best known for her facility with the 'breeches parts', her performances as Viola in [[William Shakespeare]]'s''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'' won her extensive praise. But she gained popularity with playing in ''Florizel and Perdita'', an adaptation of Shakespeare, with the role of [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] (heroine of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'') in 1779. It was during this performance that she attracted the notice of the young [[Prince of Wales]], later King [[George IV of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Paula R|title=British Women Poets of the Romantic Era: An Anthology|year=2000|location=Mary Robinson (1758\u20131800)|isbn=978-0-8018-6640-1|page=590|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cg6Jn410aCIC&pg=PA590&dq=george+iv+and+mary+robinson#v=onepage&q=george%20iv%20and%20mary%20robinson&f=false}}</ref> He offered her twenty thousand pounds to become his mistress.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Leslie|title=Royal Affairs: A Lusty Romp Through the Extramarital Adventures That Rocked the British Monarchy|year=2008|location=George IV and Mary Robinson 1757\u20131800|isbn=978-0-451-22398-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5NG9N7oMT0C&pg=PT201&dq=george+iv+and+mary+robinson#v=onepage&q=george%20iv%20and%20mary%20robinson&f=false}}</ref>  During this time, the very young [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] sometimes worked as her maid and dresser at the theatre.\n\nWith her new social prominence, Robinson became a trend-setter in London, introducing a loose, flowing muslin style of gown based upon Grecian statuary that became known as the Perdita. It took Robinson a considerable amount of time to decide to leave her husband for the Prince, as she did not want to be seen by the public as that type of woman. Throughout much of her life she struggled to live in the public eye and also to stay true to the values in which she believed.  She eventually gave in to her desires to be with a man whom she thought would treat her better than Mr. Robinson. However, the Prince ended the affair in 1781, refusing to pay the promised sum.<ref>See Katharine Binhammer, 'Thinking Gender with Sexuality in 1790s Feminist Thought'.

Prior to their relationship beginning, Robinson had been having an affair with a man named Lord Malden. According to one account, Malden and Tarleton were betting men, and Malden was so confident in Robinson's loyalty to him, and believed that no man could ever take her from him. As such, he made a bet of a thousand guineas that none of the men in his circle could seduce her. Unfortunately for Malden, Tarleton accepted the bet and swooped in to not only seduce Robinson, but establish a relationship that would last the next 15 years.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson|last=Byrne|first=Paula|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=180}}</ref> This relationship, though rumoured to have started on a bet, saw Tarleton's rise in military rank and his concomitant political successes, Mary's own various illnesses, financial vicissitudes and the efforts of Tarleton's own family to end the relationship. They had no children, although Robinson had a miscarriage. However, in the end, Tarleton married Susan Bertie, an heiress and an illegitimate daughter of the young [[Robert Bertie, 4th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven|4th Duke of Ancaster]], and niece of his sisters Lady Willoughby de Eresby and Lady Cholmondeley. In 1783, Robinson suffered a mysterious illness that left her partially paralysed. Biographer [[Paula Byrne]] speculates that a [[streptococcal infection]] resulting from a miscarriage led to a severe [[rheumatic fever]] that left her disabled for the rest of her life.  \n\nFrom the late 1780s, Robinson became distinguished for her poetry and was called \"the English Sappho\".  In addition to poems, she wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death.  Like her contemporary [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], she championed the rights of women and was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution.  She died in poverty at Englefield Cottage, [[Englefield Green]], [[Surrey]], 26 December 1800, aged 44, having survived several years of ill health, and was survived by her daughter, Maria Elizabeth (1774-1818), who was also a published novelist. Administration of her estate was granted to her husband Thomas Robinson from whom she had long been separated and who in 1803 inherited a substantial estate from his half-brother William.<ref>Anthony Camp, ''Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction: 1714-1936'' (2007) 134.</ref> One of Robinson's dying wishes was to see the rest of her works published. She tasked her daughter, Maria Robinson, with publishing most of these works. She also placed her ''Memoirs'' in the care of her daughter, insisting that she publish the work. Maria Robinson published ''Memoirs'' just a few months later. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/robinson/biography.html|title=Mary Darby Robinson (1758-1800)|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Portraits ===\nDuring her lifetime, Robinson also enjoyed the distinction of having her image captured by the most notable artists of the period.

In 1796 she wrote ''Angelina: A Novel.'' It cost more money than it brought in. Through this novel, she offers her thoughts on the afterlife of her literary career. \n\nAfter years of scholarly neglect, Robinson's literary afterlife continues apace. While most of the early literature written about Robinson focused on her sexuality, emphasising her affairs and fashions, she also spoke out about woman's place in the literary world, for which she began to receive the attention of feminists and literary scholars in the 1990s. Robinson recognised that, \u201dwomen writers were deeply ambivalent about the myths of authorship their male counterparts had created\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Linda H|date=1994|title=Becoming an Author: Mary Robinson's Memoirs and the Origins of the Woman Artist's Autobiography.|url=|journal=Re-visioning Romanticism: British Women Writers, 1776-1837|volume=|pages=37\u201350|via=}}</ref> and as a result she sought to elevate woman's place in the literary world by recognising women writers in her own work. In ''A Letter to the Women of England'', Robinson includes an entire page dedicated to English women writers to support her notion that they were just as capable as men of being successful in the literary world. These ideas have continued to keep Mary Robinson relevant in literary discussions today. In addition to maintaining literary and cultural notability, she has re-attained a degree of celebrity in recent years when several biographies of her appeared, including one by Paula Byrne entitled ''Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, and Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson'' that became a top-ten best-seller after being selected for the [[Richard & Judy Book Club]]. \n\nAn eight-volume scholarly edition of Robinson's complete works was published in 2009\u20132010. In 2011, [[Daniel Robinson (writer)|Daniel Robinson]] (no relation), editor of the poetry for the edition, published the first scholarly monograph to focus exclusively on her literary achievement--''The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame.'' A second monograph on Robinson's literary career, ''Mary Robinson and the Genesis of Romanticism: Literary Dialogues and Debts, 1784-1821'', by Ashley Cross, appeared in 2016. Although, Robinson's novels were not as successful as she hoped, she had a talent for her poetry. Her ability to produce poetry can be seen furthermore in her poems titled \"Sappho and Phaeon\". Since the press had given her the name \"The English Sappho\", a clear relationship can be drawn between these poems and her literary name. The poems are love poems and many scholars have come to the conclusion that they represent her affairs with the Prince of Wales. Mary Darby Robinson was not only praised in ther literary circle for her poetry but also for her works written in prose. The two best known examples are \"A Letter to the Women of England\" (1798) and \"The Natural Daughter\" (1799). Both her works are dealing with the role of women during the Romantic Era. Mary Robinson as much as Mary Wollenstonecraft tried to put the focus on how inferior women were treated in comparison to men. The discrepancy can be seen in both of her works. \"The Natural Daughter\" can be seen as an autobiography of Mary Robinson. The characters are in many ways patterns of her own life and the stages of her life. All the characters are symbols of her own coming of age or people she met in her life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The feminization of fame, 1750\u20131830|last=1977-|first=Brock, Claire|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1403989918|location=Basingstoke [England]|oclc=64511330}}</ref>\n\n=== Poetry ===\n[[File:Reynolds - Mary Darby, Mrs Thomas Robinson 'Perdita'.jpg|thumb|''Perdita'', portrait by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1782.]]\nFrom the late 1780s, Robinson, striving to separate herself from her past scandals, and life as a theatre actress, turned to writing as a full-time career.<ref name=\"Eleanor. 1832\">Ty, Eleanor. \u201cMary Robinson.\u201d British Reform Writers, 1789-1832.

The overarching plot is about her love for a boatman named Phaon. These stories were originally told by Ovid, but Robinson puts her own spin on the story. Robinson wrote forty-four sonnets about Sappho and Phaon, but she also writes a preface and a section called \"Account of Sappho\" that appear before the sonnets. In the preface, Robinson states that she writes her sonnets in the Petrarchan style and writes about Sappho as a person and who she was which she also does in the \"Account of Sappho\". Robinson praises Sappho in those works saying Sappho herself is, \"unrivalled\", \"illustrious\", or \"the most exquisite talents\". Robinson's love for Sappho is blunt. The relationship between Robinson and Sappho, and between Sappho and Phaon, is surely influenced by the sensibility movement of the period. Robinson writes Sappho with much passion for Phaon. In the sonnets, Sappho is lovesick for Phaon. She lives Lesbos to follows him to Sicily and eventually jumps off the Leucadian cliffs to die. However, Sappho going to Sicily and eventually jumping off a cliff to die is the legend of other stories about Sappho. In the Robinson version, Sappho died of her lovesickness for Phaon, causing her to commit suicide. This is highly reflective of the suffering Robinson faced within her own life.<br><br>Robinson was called, \"The English Sappho\" first on January 20, 1798 by \"The Morning Post\" who called her \"the dignified title of the English Sappho\". Mary Robinson identified in Sappho very much not because they both suffered through heartbreaks, but also because they were both female poets. Sappho was an established classical Greek poet. Robinson, an English poet from the 1700s. There were not many female poets back then especially for ones for Mary to look up too. Sappho served as a figure that Robinson could look up to and find relatable. That is shown through Robinson's collection of \"Sappho and Phaon: In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets, with Thoughts on Poetical Subjects, and Ancedotes of the Grecian Poetess\" Selection|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.library.tamu.edu|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/apr/12/sappho-phaon-mary-robinson|title=Poem of the week: Sappho and Phaon by Mary Robinson|last=Rumens|first=Carol|date=2010-04-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n[[File:Romney - Mrs Mary Robinson.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], c. 1782]]\n\nDuring the 1790s, Robinson was highly inspired by feminism and desired to spread her liberal sentiments through her writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Robinson, Mary. A Letter to the Women of England and The Natural Daughter. Edited by Sharon M. Setzer, broadview literary texts, 2003</ref> She was an ardent admirer of [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], an established and influential feminist writer of the period. But to Robinson\u2019s surprise, her intense feelings were not reciprocated by Wollstonecraft.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While Robinson expected a strong friendship between the two of them to flourish, Wollstonecraft \u201cfound Robinson herself considerably less appealing than the title character of Angelina\u201d.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In 1796, Wollstonecraft wrote an extremely harsh review of Robinson's work in the Analytical Review. It was this critique that was not critical, or well thought out. Instead, Wollstonecraft's review of Robinson proved to be relatively shallow and pointed at her jealousy of Robinson's comparable freedom. Wollstonecraft had the potential to spend more of her own time writing, instead of having to entertain her husband, William Goodwin.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Robinson's \"Letter to the Women of England against Mental Subordination\" is still powerful reading. Robinson reiterates the rights women have to live by sexual passion.\n\nLastly, in 1800, after years of failing health and decline into financial ruin, Robinson wrote her last piece of literature during her lifetime: a series of poems titled the ''Lyrical Tales'', published by Longman & Rees, in London. This poetry collection explored themes of domestic violence, misogyny, violence against destitute characters, and political oppression. \u201cRobinson\u2019s last work pleads for a recognition of the moral and rational worth of women: \u2018Let me ask this plain and rational question-- is not woman a human being, gifted with all the feelings that inhabit the bosom of man?\".<ref name=\"Eleanor. 1832\"/> Robinson's main objective was to respond to ''Lyrical Ballads''  written by authors [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Coleridge's notebooks|Coleridge]]; who were not as well known at the time. Although it was not as highly praised as May Wollstonecraft's \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\", published in 1792, Lyrical Tales provides a \u201cpowerful critique of the division of duties and privileges between the sexes. It places Robinson firmly on the side of the \u2018feminist\u2019 thinkers or \u2018modern\u2019 philosophers of the 1790s, as one of the strong defenders of her sex\".<ref name=\"Eleanor. 1832\"/>\n\n== Criticism and Reception ==\nRobinson was known as a sexualised celebrity, but she was a very talented writer. Robinson did not receive recognition for her work until much later because of \"strict attitudes led to a rejection of the literary work of such a notorious woman.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/robinson/biography.html|title=Mary Darby Robinson (1758\u20131800)|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref> She became a lesson to young girls about the dangers of promiscuity, and pleasure seeking.

The money helped to support herself, her mother and daughter, and often [[Banastre Tarleton]]. Novels such as ''Vancenza'' (1792), ''The Widow'' (1794), ''Angelina'' (1796), and ''Walsingham'' (1797) went through multiple editions and were often translated into French and German. They owed part of their popularity to their suspected autobiographical elements. Even when her characters were placed in scenes of gothic horror, their views could be related to the experiences of their author.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nMary Robinson was one of the first female celebrities of the modern era. She was scandalous, but on the other hand educated and able to be partially independent from her husband. She was one of the first women to enter the sphere of writing, and to be successful there. Scholars often argue that she used her celebrity and fame status only in her own advantage, but it has to be noted how much she contributed to the awareness of early feminism. She tried to elaborate the ideas of equality for women in England during the late 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ravonjournal.org/|title=Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net|website=Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> Nevertheless, many contemporary women were not amused with how she exposed herself to the public and ostracised her.

She lived in England, in the cities of Bristol and London; she also lived for a time in France and Germany. She enjoyed poetry from the age of seven and started working, first as a teacher and then as actress, from the age of fourteen. She wrote many plays, poems and novels. She was a celebrity, gossiped about in newspapers, famous for her acting and writing .  During her lifetime she was known as \"the English Sappho\".<ref>Mary Robinson, Sappho and Phaon, About the Book</ref><ref>Judith Pascoe, Romantic Theatricality, Cornell University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8014-3304-5}}, p.13</ref> She earned her nickname \"Perdita\" for her role as [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] (heroine of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'') in 1779. She was the first public mistress of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] while he was still Prince of Wales.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRobinson was born in [[Bristol]], England to Nicholas Darby, a [[captain (naval)|naval captain]], and his wife Hester (n\u00e9e Vanacott) who had married at Donyatt, Somerset, in 1749, and was baptised 'Polle(y)' (\"Spelt 'Polle' in the official register and 'Polly' in the Bishop's Transcript\") at St Augustine's Church, Bristol, 19 July 1758,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perdita : the life of Mary Robinson|last=Paula.|first=Byrne|date=2005|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0007164592|location=London|oclc=224036999}}</ref> the entry noting that she was born 27 November 1756.<ref>Anthony Camp, ''Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction: 1714-1936'' (2007) 133-34.</ref> In her memoirs,<ref>Her daughter Mary Elizabeth, honoring her mother's request, published a draft of Robinson's memoirs in 1801 as ''Memoirs, with some Posthumous Pieces'',</ref> Robinson gives her birth in 1758 but the year 1757 seems more likely according to recently published research (see appendix to Byrne, 2005). Her father deserted her mother and took on a mistress when Robinson was still a child. The family hoped for a reconciliation, but Captain Darby made it clear that this was not going to happen. Without the support of her husband, Hester Darby supported herself and the five children born of the marriage by starting a school for young girls in [[Little Chelsea]], [[London]], (where Robinson taught by her 14th birthday).{{sfn|Levy|2004}} However, during one of his brief returns to the family, Captain Darby had the school closed<ref>Feldman, p. 590</ref> (which he was entitled to do by English law). Darby died in the Russian naval service in 1785. Robinson, who at one point attended a school run by the social reformer [[Hannah More]], came to the attention of actor [[David Garrick]].\n\n===Marriage===\nHester Darby encouraged her daughter to accept the proposal of an [[articled clerk]], Thomas Robinson, who claimed to have an inheritance. Mary was against this idea; however, after being stricken ill, and watching him take care of her and her younger brother, she felt that she owed him, and she did not want to disappoint her mother who was pushing for the engagement. After the early marriage, Robinson discovered that her husband did not have an inheritance. He continued to live an elaborate lifestyle, however, and had multiple affairs that he made no effort to hide. Subsequently, Mary supported their family. After her husband squandered their money, the couple fled to [[Talgarth]], [[Breconshire]] (where Robinson's only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was born in November). Here they lived in a fairly large estate, called Tregunter Park. Eventually her husband was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison where she lived with him for many months. While it was common for the wives of prisoners to live with their husbands while indebted, children were usually sent to live with relatives to keep them away from the dangers of prison. However, Robinson was deeply devoted to her daughter Maria, and when her husband was imprisoned, Robinson brought the 6-month-old baby with her.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson|last=Byrne|first=Paula|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=56}}</ref> \n\nIt was in the Fleet Prison that Robinson\u2019s literary career really began, as she found that she could publish poetry to earn money, and to give her an escape from the harsh reality that had become her life. Her first book, ''Poems By Mrs. Robinson'', was published in 1775 by C. Parker.<ref name=\"Runge\">{{Cite web |url=http://chuma.cas.usf.edu/~runge/MRobinson.htm |title=Mary Darby Robinson (1758?-1800) - Bibliography |last=Runge |first=Laura L. |date=September 21, 2001 |access-date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, Darby was offered work in the form of copying legal documents so he could try to pay back some of his debts, but he refused to do anything. Robinson, in an effort to keep the family together and to get back to normal life outside of prison, took the job instead, collecting the pay that her husband neglected to earn.<ref name=\":5\" /> During this time, Mary Robinson found a patron in [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]], who sponsored the publication of Robinson's second volume of poems, ''Captivity.''\n\n===Theatre===\n[[File:Florizel and Perdita 1783.jpg|thumb|[[Caricature]] of the Prince of Wales as [[Florizel (The Winter's Tale)|Florizel]] and Mary Robinson as [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]], 1783]]\n\nAfter her husband obtained his release from prison, Robinson decided to return to the theatre. She launched her acting career and took to the stage, playing Juliet, at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] in December 1776. Robinson was best known for her facility with the 'breeches parts', her performances as Viola in [[William Shakespeare]]'s''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'' won her extensive praise. But she gained popularity with playing in ''Florizel and Perdita'', an adaptation of Shakespeare, with the role of [[Perdita (The Winter's Tale)|Perdita]] (heroine of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'') in 1779. It was during this performance that she attracted the notice of the young [[Prince of Wales]], later King [[George IV of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Paula R|title=British Women Poets of the Romantic Era: An Anthology|year=2000|location=Mary Robinson (1758\u20131800)|isbn=978-0-8018-6640-1|page=590|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cg6Jn410aCIC&pg=PA590&dq=george+iv+and+mary+robinson#v=onepage&q=george%20iv%20and%20mary%20robinson&f=false}}</ref> He offered her twenty thousand pounds to become his mistress.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Leslie|title=Royal Affairs: A Lusty Romp Through the Extramarital Adventures That Rocked the British Monarchy|year=2008|location=George IV and Mary Robinson 1757\u20131800|isbn=978-0-451-22398-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5NG9N7oMT0C&pg=PT201&dq=george+iv+and+mary+robinson#v=onepage&q=george%20iv%20and%20mary%20robinson&f=false}}</ref>  During this time, the very young [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] sometimes worked as her maid and dresser at the theatre.\n\nWith her new social prominence, Robinson became a trend-setter in London, introducing a loose, flowing muslin style of gown based upon Grecian statuary that became known as the Perdita. It took Robinson a considerable amount of time to decide to leave her husband for the Prince, as she did not want to be seen by the public as that type of woman. Throughout much of her life she struggled to live in the public eye and also to stay true to the values in which she believed.  She eventually gave in to her desires to be with a man whom she thought would treat her better than Mr. Robinson. However, the Prince ended the affair in 1781, refusing to pay the promised sum.<ref>See Katharine Binhammer, 'Thinking Gender with Sexuality in 1790s Feminist Thought'.

Prior to their relationship beginning, Robinson had been having an affair with a man named Lord Malden. According to one account, Malden and Tarleton were betting men, and Malden was so confident in Robinson\u2019s loyalty to him, and believed that no man could ever take her from him. As such, he made a bet of a thousand guineas that none of the men in his circle could seduce her. Unfortunately for Malden, Tarleton accepted the bet and swooped in to not only seduce Robinson, but establish a relationship that would last the next 15 years.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson|last=Byrne|first=Paula|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|pages=180}}</ref> This relationship, though rumoured to have started on a bet, saw Tarleton's rise in military rank and his concomitant political successes, Mary's own various illnesses, financial vicissitudes and the efforts of Tarleton's own family to end the relationship. They had no children, although Robinson had a miscarriage. However, in the end, Tarleton married Susan Bertie, an heiress and an illegitimate daughter of the young [[Robert Bertie, 4th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven|4th Duke of Ancaster]], and niece of his sisters Lady Willoughby de Eresby and Lady Cholmondeley. In 1783, Robinson suffered a mysterious illness that left her partially paralysed. Biographer [[Paula Byrne]] speculates that a [[streptococcal infection]] resulting from a miscarriage led to a severe [[rheumatic fever]] that left her disabled for the rest of her life.  \n\nFrom the late 1780s, Robinson became distinguished for her poetry and was called \"the English Sappho\".  In addition to poems, she wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death.  Like her contemporary [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], she championed the rights of women and was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution.  She died in poverty at Englefield Cottage, [[Englefield Green]], [[Surrey]], 26 December 1800, aged 44, having survived several years of ill health, and was survived by her daughter, Maria Elizabeth (1774-1818), who was also a published novelist. Administration of her estate was granted to her husband Thomas Robinson from whom she had long been separated and who in 1803 inherited a substantial estate from his half-brother William.<ref>Anthony Camp, ''Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction: 1714-1936'' (2007) 134.</ref> One of Robinson\u2019s dying wishes was to see the rest of her works published. She tasked her daughter, Maria Robinson, with publishing most of these works. She also placed her ''Memoirs'' in the care of her daughter, insisting that she publish the work. Maria Robinson published ''Memoirs'' just a few months later. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/robinson/biography.html|title=Mary Darby Robinson (1758-1800)|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Portraits ===\nDuring her lifetime, Robinson also enjoyed the distinction of having her image captured by the most notable artists of the period.

In 1796 she wrote ''Angelina: A Novel.'' It cost more money than it brought in. Through this novel, she offers her thoughts on the afterlife of her literary career. \n\nAfter years of scholarly neglect, Robinson's literary afterlife continues apace. While most of the early literature written about Robinson focused on her sexuality, emphasising her affairs and fashions, she also spoke out about woman\u2019s place in the literary world, for which she began to receive the attention of feminists and literary scholars in the 1990s. Robinson recognised that, \u201dwomen writers were deeply ambivalent about the myths of authorship their male counterparts had created\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Linda H|date=1994|title=Becoming an Author: Mary Robinson's Memoirs and the Origins of the Woman Artist's Autobiography.|url=|journal=Re-visioning Romanticism: British Women Writers, 1776-1837|volume=|pages=37\u201350|via=}}</ref> and as a result she sought to elevate woman\u2019s place in the literary world by recognising women writers in her own work. In ''A Letter to the Women of England'', Robinson includes an entire page dedicated to English women writers to support her notion that they were just as capable as men of being successful in the literary world. These ideas have continued to keep Mary Robinson relevant in literary discussions today. In addition to maintaining literary and cultural notability, she has re-attained a degree of celebrity in recent years when several biographies of her appeared, including one by Paula Byrne entitled ''Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, and Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson'' that became a top-ten best-seller after being selected for the [[Richard & Judy Book Club]]. \n\nAn eight-volume scholarly edition of Robinson's complete works was published in 2009-2010. In 2011, [[Daniel Robinson (writer)|Daniel Robinson]] (no relation), editor of the poetry for the edition, published the first scholarly monograph to focus exclusively on her literary achievement--''The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame.'' A second monograph on Robinson's literary career, ''Mary Robinson and the Genesis of Romanticism: Literary Dialogues and Debts, 1784-1821'', by Ashley Cross, appeared in 2016. Although, Robinson's novels were not as successful as she hoped, she had a talent for her poetry. Her ability to produce poetry can be seen furthermore in her poems titled \"Sappho and Phaeon\". Since the press had given her the name \"The English Sappho\", a clear relationship can be drawn between these poems and her literary name. The poems are love poems and many scholars have come to the conclusion that they represent her affairs with the Prince of Wales. Mary Darby Robinson was not only praised in ther literary circle for her poetry but also for her works written in prose. The two best known examples are \"A Letter to the Women of England\" (1798) and \"The Natural Daughter\" (1799). Both her works are dealing with the role of women during the Romantic Era. Mary Robinson as much as Mary Wollenstonecraft tried to put the focus on how inferior women were treated in comparison to men. The discrepancy can be seen in both of her works. \"The Natural Daughter\" can be seen as an autobiography of Mary Robinson. The characters are in many ways patterns of her own life and the stages of her life. All the characters are symbols of her own coming of age or people she met in her life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The feminization of fame, 1750\u20131830|last=1977-|first=Brock, Claire|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1403989918|location=Basingstoke [England]|oclc=64511330}}</ref>\n\n=== Poetry ===\n[[File:Reynolds - Mary Darby, Mrs Thomas Robinson 'Perdita'.jpg|thumb|''Perdita'', portrait by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1782.]]\nFrom the late 1780s, Robinson, striving to separate herself from her past scandals, and life as a theatre actress, turned to writing as a full-time career.<ref name=\"Eleanor. 1832\">Ty, Eleanor. \u201cMary Robinson.\u201d British Reform Writers, 1789-1832.

The overarching plot is about her love for a boatman named Phaon. These stories were originally told by Ovid, but Robinson puts her own spin on the story. Robinson wrote forty-four sonnets about Sappho and Phaon, but she also writes a preface and a section called \"Account of Sappho\" that appear before the sonnets. In the preface, Robinson states that she writes her sonnets in the Petrarchan style and writes about Sappho as a person and who she was which she also does in the \"Account of Sappho\". Robinson praises Sappho in those works saying Sappho herself is, \"unrivalled\", \"illustrious\", or \"the most exquisite talents\". Robinson's love for Sappho is blunt. The relationship between Robinson and Sappho, and between Sappho and Phaon, is surely influenced by the sensibility movement of the period. Robinson writes Sappho with much passion for Phaon. In the sonnets, Sappho is lovesick for Phaon. She lives Lesbos to follows him to Sicily and eventually jumps off the Leucadian cliffs to die. However, Sappho going to Sicily and eventually jumping off a cliff to die is the legend of other stories about Sappho. In the Robinson version, Sappho died of her lovesickness for Phaon, causing her to commit suicide. This is highly reflective of the suffering Robinson faced within her own life.<br><br>Robinson was called, \"The English Sappho\" first on January 20, 1798 by \"The Morning Post\" who called her \"the dignified title of the English Sappho\". Mary Robinson identified in Sappho very much not because they both suffered through heartbreaks, but also because they were both female poets. Sappho was an established classical Greek poet. Robinson, an English poet from the 1700s. There were not many female poets back then especially for ones for Mary to look up too. Sappho served as a figure that Robinson could look up to and find relatable. That is shown through Robinson's collection of \"Sappho and Phaon: In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets, with Thoughts on Poetical Subjects, and Ancedotes of the Grecian Poetess\" Selection|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.library.tamu.edu|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/apr/12/sappho-phaon-mary-robinson|title=Poem of the week: Sappho and Phaon by Mary Robinson|last=Rumens|first=Carol|date=2010-04-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n[[File:Romney - Mrs Mary Robinson.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], c. 1782]]\n\nDuring the 1790s, Robinson was highly inspired by feminism and desired to spread her liberal sentiments through her writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Robinson, Mary. A Letter to the Women of England and The Natural Daughter. Edited by Sharon M. Setzer, broadview literary texts, 2003</ref> She was an ardent admirer of [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], an established and influential feminist writer of the period. But to Robinson\u2019s surprise, her intense feelings were not reciprocated by Wollstonecraft.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While Robinson expected a strong friendship between the two of them to flourish, Wollstonecraft \u201cfound Robinson herself considerably less appealing than the title character of Angelina\u201d.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In 1796, Wollstonecraft wrote an extremely harsh review of Robinson\u2019s work in the Analytical Review. It was this critique that was not critical, or well thought out. Instead, Wollstonecraft\u2019s review of Robinson proved to be relatively shallow and pointed at her jealousy of Robinson\u2019s comparable freedom. Wollstonecraft had the potential to spend more of her own time writing, instead of having to entertain her husband, William Goodwin.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Robinson's \"Letter to the Women of England against Mental Subordination\" is still powerful reading. Robinson reiterates the rights women have to live by sexual passion.\n\nLastly, in 1800, after years of failing health and decline into financial ruin, Robinson wrote her last piece of literature during her lifetime: a series of poems titled the ''Lyrical Tales'', published by Longman & Rees, in London. This poetry collection explored themes of domestic violence, misogyny, violence against destitute characters, and political oppression. \u201cRobinson\u2019s last work pleads for a recognition of the moral and rational worth of women: \u2018Let me ask this plain and rational question-- is not woman a human being, gifted with all the feelings that inhabit the bosom of man?\".<ref name=\"Eleanor. 1832\"/> Robinson's main objective was to respond to ''Lyrical Ballads''  written by authors [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Coleridge's notebooks|Coleridge]]; who were not as well known at the time. Although it was not as highly praised as May Wollstonecraft\u2019s \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\", published in 1792, Lyrical Tales provides a \u201cpowerful critique of the division of duties and privileges between the sexes. It places Robinson firmly on the side of the \u2018feminist\u2019 thinkers or \u2018modern\u2019 philosophers of the 1790s, as one of the strong defenders of her sex\".<ref name=\"Eleanor. 1832\"/>\n\n== Criticism and Reception ==\nRobinson was known as a sexualised celebrity, but she was a very talented writer. Robinson did not receive recognition for her work until much later because of \"strict attitudes led to a rejection of the literary work of such a notorious woman.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/robinson/biography.html|title=Mary Darby Robinson (1758\u20131800)|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref> She became a lesson to young girls about the dangers of promiscuity, and pleasure seeking.

The money helped to support herself, her mother and daughter, and often [[Banastre Tarleton]]. Novels such as ''Vancenza'' (1792), ''The Widow'' (1794), ''Angelina'' (1796), and ''Walsingham'' (1797) went through multiple editions and were often translated into French and German. They owed part of their popularity to their suspected autobiographical elements. Even when her characters were placed in scenes of gothic horror, their views could be related to the experiences of their author.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nMary Robinson was one of the first female celebrities of the modern era. She was scandalous, but on the other hand educated and able to be partially independent from her husband. She was one of the first women to enter the sphere of writing, and to be successful there. Scholars often argue that she used her celebrity and fame status only in her own advantage, but it has to be noted how much she contributed to the awareness of early feminism. She tried to elaborate the ideas of equality for women in England during the late 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ravonjournal.org/|title=Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net|website=Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> Nevertheless, many contemporary women were not amused with how she exposed herself to the public and ostracised her.

She was baptised at [[St_Andrew%27s_Church,_Plymouth|St Andrew's Church, Plymouth]] together with her younger sister Hannah Lydia (born 30 November 1837) on 27 December 1837. Her subsequent use of her sister Louisa's birth certificate in her 1886 ''M\u00e9moires'', amended to appear as if it were her own, led to over a century of confusion over her date of birth. The exact date in December is still unknown.\n\nHer father was the [[cello|cellist]] and composer [[Frederick Nicholls Crouch]] who had married her mother the contralto Lydia, n\u00e9e Pearson, at [[St_Paul%27s,_Covent_Garden | St Paul's Church, Covent Garden]] in 1832. By April 1841 Crouch had returned to London, leaving his wife and daughters in Plymouth. In 1843 he went through a Roman Catholic marriage ceremony with Elizabeth 'Bessie' George and had two more children<ref>{{cite journal |title=Case of desertion |journal=London Evening Standard |date=19 September 1849}}</ref>. He left for the United States in 1849 leaving both wives and families behind. With several young children to care for, her mother Lydia brought Richard William Littley into the household, who was to be considered a \u201cstepfather\u201d by her children. Emma was sent to a convent boarding school in [[Boulogne]], France, but later returned to live with her paternal grandmother, Anna Maria (n\u00e9e Nicholls). Following the death of [[Frederick Nicholls Crouch]]'s father, she married the former Secretary of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], violinist, composer and arranger William Watts. In 1851, Emma and her sister Hannah were living with these grandparents in Jersey. \n\nIt was a life that Emma found confining, and her restless nature and innate curiosity rebelled. She defied her grandmother's cautions regarding the dangers that a young woman faced out in the streets unchaperoned. On her own one day, she accepted the advances of an older man who approached her on the street, allowing him to take her to a drinking den where he wooed her with cakes and plied her with alcohol, ultimately taking her virginity. Upon awakening, she found the man had left her a five-pound note \u2014 more money than she had ever seen. She was approximately twenty years old at the time and later said the encounter left her with \"an instinctive horror of men.\" After her abrupt initiation into sex, she did not return to her grandmother's home, nor go back to her mother, but rented a room for herself in Covent Garden.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|p=26}}\n\n=== New life in London ===\nOn her own in London, Pearl made the acquaintance of Robert Bignell, proprietor of a notorious pleasure establishment, The Argyll Rooms. A combination of bar, dance hall, and women available for hire, it provided private alcoves and rooms where couples could retire for sexual activity.  She soon vacated her single room and moved into a suite at the [[London Trocadero|Argyll Rooms]], becoming Bignell's mistress.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=26-27}} Studying the life around her she realized that the life of the common prostitute was a tragic one, at best the women would end up \"poor and degraded,\" at worst the future held \"disease and death.\" She was determined to practice her trade with higher expectations. Her goal was to become the [[kept woman]] of select dedicated lovers, ones with the financial means to keep her in luxury.\n\nHer involvement with Bignell lasted for some time. They travelled to [[Paris]], posing as a married couple. So enamoured did she become with the city that she insisted that Bignell return to London without her. She was determined to remain in the French capital. It was at this time that Emma Crouch became \"Cora Pearl,\" a fanciful name chosen to resonate with the new identity and future she hoped to craft for herself in Paris.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|p=26}}\n\n== Life as a courtesan ==\nAgain on her own in a major metropolis, she adopted the name Cora Pearl and worked as a prostitute. She made a connection with a procurer, a \"Monsieur Roubisse,\" who set her up in more suitable quarters, taught her the business rudiments of her new trade and tutored her in refining and broadening her repertoire of professional skills. She worked for him for six years.\n\nHer first lover of distinction was the twenty-five-year-old Victor Mass\u00e9na, third Duke du Rivoli, and later fifth Prince of Essling.  He set her up in opulence, giving her money, jewels, servants and a private chef. He provided her with funds for gambling when she visited the casinos and racecourse in the fashionable resort of [[Baden]], Germany. He bought her the first horse she ever owned, and she became an accomplished horsewoman; it was said \"she rode like an [[Amazons|Amazon]]\" and \"was kinder to her horses than her lovers.\"  Her liaison with Mass\u00e9na lasted five years. While cultivating Mass\u00e9na, she was simultaneously sharing her favours with Prince Achille Murat, a man eleven years younger than Mass\u00e9na.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|p=27}}\n\nBy 1860, Pearl was one of the most celebrated courtesans in Paris. She was the mistress of notable aristocrats, the [[Prince of Orange]], heir to the throne of the [[Netherlands]], Ludovic, Duc de Grammont-Caderousse, and more significantly [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny|Charles Duc de Morny]], who was the half-brother of the Emperor [[Napoleon III]].  The Emperor's brother generously contributed to the life Pearl demanded.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=28-29}}\n\nIn 1864, Pearl rented a [[chateau]] in the region of the [[Loiret]]. Known as the Ch\u00e2teau de ''Beaus\u00e9jour'' (\"beautiful sojourn\"), it was a luxurious residence with [[stained glass]] windows, expensively decorated and immaculately maintained interiors and grounds. Her boudoir had a custom-made bronze bath monogrammed with her initials intertwined in gold. The ch\u00e2teau was conceived for gala entertainments. There were rarely fewer than fifteen guests at the dinner table, and the chef was instructed to spare no cost on the expenditure for food.  Pearl was known for devising entertainments of an unexpected and outrageous theatricality, of which she invariably was the star attraction. On one such evening, she dared the group assembled around the dinner table \"to cut into the next dish\" about to be served. The meal's next course was Cora Pearl herself, presented lying naked on a huge silver platter, garnished with parsley, and carried in by four large men.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=28-29}}\n\nHer most dedicated benefactor and enduring admirer was [[Napol\u00e9on Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte]], the Emperor's cousin. She met the prince in 1868 when he was forty-two years old. Their liaison lasted nine years, the longest relationship in Pearl's career. He bought her several homes, one a veritable palace: \"les Petites Tuileries.\"\n\nIn 1860, Pearl made an appearance at a masquerade ball attended by the elite of Parisian society. She caused a sensation as a scantily costumed [[Eve]], whose degree of nudity diverged little from the biblical original. Invariably enthusiastic about exhibiting her physical charms to an audience, she took the role of a singing [[Cupid]] in the [[Jacques Offenbach]] operetta ''Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers'', (''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'') performed at the Theatre Bouffes-Parisien in 1867. It was written that \"Cora Pearl made an appearance half-naked on the stage. That evening the [[Jockey-Club de Paris|Jockey Club]] in its entirety, graced the theatre. All the names\u2026of French nobility were there\u2026It was a success of a kind\u2026\" The chronicle of the evening continued, \"Apparently the beautiful Cora Pearl had already munched up a ''brochette'' (\"skewer\") of five or six historical fortunes with her pretty white teeth.\"{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=31-32}}\n\nThe high point of Pearl\u2019s career as courtesan were the years 1865-1870. In his biography of Pearl, ''The Pearl From Plymouth'' (1950), W. H. Holden wrote that there was evidence that Pearl regularly sent money to both her mother in England and father in America.  For Cora Pearl, money was for spending, for accumulating the luxuries of life and buying her way to a coveted perch in the upper echelons of society. Her jewel collection alone was valued at some one million francs; at one point, she owned three homes, and her clothing was made for her by the renowned [[couturier]] [[Charles Frederick Worth]].{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=30-32}}  As her career prospered, the gifts from her suitors needed to be both costly and imaginative. She pitted her admirers against one other, raising the price for her favours as the game between competitors escalated. In her heyday, she was able to command as much as ten thousand francs for an evening with her.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=34-38}}\n\n=== Celebrity ===\n\nShe dressed creatively, with the intent to provoke either shock or awe. [[Th\u00e9odore de Banville]] wrote of her affinity for dyeing her hair bold colours. She was seen riding out in her carriage, her hair the colour of a lemon, dyed to match the carriage's yellow satin interior.  She once appeared in a blue gown, her dog\u2019s coat coloured to match her wardrobe. She was a proponent of the obviously made-up face, using makeup for her eyelashes, eyes, and face powder tinted with silver or pearl to give her skin a shimmering translucence. Jean-Philippe Worth, the son of the couturier Worth, pronounced her \"shockingly overdone.\"  In 1867, a drink came into vogue, inspired by Pearl, dubbed the \"Tears of Cora Pearl.\"{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=34-35}} Alfred Delvau wrote a tribute to Pearl in ''Les Plaisirs de Paris'' (1867): \"You are today, Madame, the renown, the preoccupation, the scandal and the toast of Paris. Everywhere they talk only of you...\"\n\n== Decline ==\n=== Scandal: ''L'affaire Duval'' ===\nAt age thirty-seven, Pearl found herself involved in an incident that would result in an irreversible downturn in her fortunes. She had become embroiled in a relationship with a wealthy young man, Alexandre Duval, ten years her junior.  His obsession with her was so intense, he spent his entire fortune on sustaining his liaison with her\u2014giving her jewels, fine horses and money. It was reported that at one point Duval gave her an exquisitely bound book, a hundred-page volume where each page was bookmarked by a one thousand franc bill. Pearl ultimately dismissed him, a finality that Duval could not countenance. On 19 December 1872, Duval went to her home, it is believed, with the intention of killing her. The gun he brought accidentally discharged, wounding him. Initially near death, he eventually recovered. Nevertheless, the consequences of what had occurred proved disastrous for Cora Pearl's reputation. Publicized as ''l'affaire Duval'', the scandal caused the authorities to order Pearl to leave the country.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|p=36}}\n\nShe was expelled from Paris and left for London and later moved to Monaco and Nice. The contents of her Paris home were sold.\n\n=== Financial woes ===\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 brought at its end a new French republic and a cultural as well as political shift. The era in which Pearl had achieved her greatest success was over. The [[Third French Republic]] saw a diminution of aristocratic privilege and a resurgence of conservative values. She was no longer able to attract the titled men who had been her prime clients. In 1874, her long tenure as the mistress of Prince Napoleon ended at his request. He wrote her a touching, carefully worded letter of regret; he could no longer sustain the emotional and professional toll the relationship required of him.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=37}}\n\nPearl was slowly forced to liquidate the fortune she had accumulated. While not destitute, by 1880 her financial situation had become dire. In 1873, she sold her rue Chaillot home. By 1883, she had returned to common prostitution, taking an apartment above the shop of a coachbuilder on the avenue [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], where she received clients. In July 1885, she was forced to sell her chateau in the Loiret.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=37-38}}\n\nHer reduced finances did not abate her passion for gambling. Habitually committed to playing for large stakes, she was now restricted to betting modest amounts. Julian Arnold, an old acquaintance, encountered Pearl outside a casino in [[Monte Carlo]]. He later wrote in his memoirs: \"I found a woman seated on the kerbstone and weeping pitifully. She appeared to be about fifty years of age, handsome\u2026but much bedraggled.\" She told him that she had been turned out of her apartment, her few belongings seized by the landlord in lieu of rent. She had no place to go, and she was hungry and in misery.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=37-38}}\n\n==== Memoirs ====\nThe ''M\u00e9moires de Cora Pearl'' had been greatly anticipated when it became known that Pearl was writing her autobiography. Published in 1886 in Paris and subsequently in England in London. She claimed to have sent relevant pages to her former lovers, offering to anonymize their names if they paid her. In the event, most names were altered but many have now been identified.\n\nIn the early 1980s, William Blatchford claimed to have located the ''Memoirs of Cora Pearl'', which he said had been published in 1890, after Pearl's death.  Supposedly an earlier version of the book published in 1886, this volume purported to date back to an earlier date, perhaps even as early 1873. Decidedly more frank and sexually explicit than the 1886 memoirs, their idiomatic English - expressive of a provincial, unsophisticated use of the language - convinced many people of the work's authenticity when the memoirs were published by Granada under the title ''Grand Horizontal, The Erotic Memoirs of a Passionate Life''. However, Blatchford turned out to be a pseudonym adopted by the real author of the 'memoirs', [[Derek Parker]], a former chairman of the [[Society of Authors]], who later admitted that he had hoaxed Granada.<ref>PHS. \"The Times Diary.\" ''London Times'', 5 April 1983: 10</ref><ref>PHS. \"The Times Diary.\" ''London Times'', 7 March 1984: 12</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nSoon after the publication of her memoirs, Pearl became seriously ill with [[intestinal cancer]]. Her biographer Holden wrote: \"The various accounts of Cora spending her last days in dire poverty in one squalid room are very much exaggerated.\" She died on 8 July 1886. Obituary notices appeared in the London and Paris papers. Her remaining possessions were disposed of in a two-day sale in October 1886. She was buried in [[Batignolles Cemetery|Batignolles]] cemetery, (plot number 10, row 4), in a grave leased for five years. After those five years, what remained of her body was removed to an [[ossuary]] and the grave was re-used.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{citation |last1=Clarke |first1=Joseph F |title=Pseudonyms: The Names behind the Names |date=1977 |publisher=Thomas Nelson Publishers |isbn=9780840765673 |language=English}}\n* {{citation |last1=Frayser |first1=Suzanne G. |last2=Whitby |first2=Thomas J. |title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide |date=1995 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781563081316 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C |language=en|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Hickman |first1=Katie |title=Courtesans: Money, Sex and Fame in the Nineteenth Century |date=2003 |publisher=William Morrow & Company |isbn=9780066209555 |edition=First |language=English|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Holden |first1=Wilfred Herbert |title=The Pearl from Plymouth: Eliza Emma Crouch, alias Cora Pearl, with notes on some of her celebrated contemporaries |date=1950 |publisher=British Technical and General Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=edQ0AAAAIAAJ |language=en}}\n* {{citation |last1=Pearl |first1=Cora |title=The Memoirs of Cora Pearl: The English Beauty of the French Empire |date=1886 |publisher=George Vickers |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Memoirs_of_Cora_Pearl.html?id=UcYsAAAAYAAJ |language=en|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Pearl |first1=Cora |editor1-last=Blatchford |editor1-first=William |title=Grand Horizontal: The Erotic Memoirs of a Passionate Lady |date=1983 |publisher=Stein and Day |isbn=9780812829174 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7O-0AAAACAAJ |language=en|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Richardson |first1=Joanna |author-link=Joanna Richardson|title=The courtesans: the demi-monde in nineteenth-century France |date=1967 |publisher=World Pub.

She met the prince in 1868 when he was forty-two years old. Their liaison lasted nine years, the longest relationship in Pearl's career. He bought her several homes, one a veritable palace: \"les Petites Tuileries.\"\n\nIn 1860, Pearl made an appearance at a masquerade ball attended by the elite of Parisian society. She caused a sensation as a scantily costumed [[Eve]], whose degree of nudity diverged little from the biblical original. Invariably enthusiastic about exhibiting her physical charms to an audience, she took the role of a singing [[Cupid]] in the [[Jacques Offenbach]] operetta ''Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers'', (''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'') performed at the Theatre Bouffes-Parisien in 1867. It was written that \"Cora Pearl made an appearance half-naked on the stage. That evening the [[Jockey-Club de Paris|Jockey Club]] in its entirety, graced the theatre. All the names\u2026of French nobility were there\u2026It was a success of a kind\u2026\" The chronicle of the evening continued, \"Apparently the beautiful Cora Pearl had already munched up a ''brochette'' (\"skewer\") of five or six historical fortunes with her pretty white teeth.\"{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=31-32}}\n\nThe high point of Pearl\u2019s career as courtesan were the years 1865-1870. In his biography of Pearl, ''The Pearl From Plymouth'' (1950), W. H. Holden wrote that there was evidence that Pearl regularly sent money to both her mother in England and father in America.  For Cora Pearl, money was for spending, for accumulating the luxuries of life and buying her way to a coveted perch in the upper echelons of society. Her jewel collection alone was valued at some one million francs; at one point, she owned three homes, and her clothing was made for her by the renowned [[couturier]] [[Charles Frederick Worth]].{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=30-32}}  As her career prospered, the gifts from her suitors needed to be both costly and imaginative. She pitted her admirers against one other, raising the price for her favours as the game between competitors escalated. In her heyday, she was able to command as much as ten thousand francs for an evening with her.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=34-38}}\n\n=== Celebrity ===\n\nShe dressed creatively, with the intent to provoke either shock or awe. [[Th\u00e9odore de Banville]] wrote of her affinity for dyeing her hair bold colours. She was seen riding out in her carriage, her hair the colour of a lemon, dyed to match the carriage's yellow satin interior.  She once appeared in a blue gown, her dog\u2019s coat coloured to match her wardrobe. She was a proponent of the obviously made-up face, using makeup for her eyelashes, eyes, and face powder tinted with silver or pearl to give her skin a shimmering translucence. Jean-Philippe Worth, the son of the couturier Worth, pronounced her \"shockingly overdone.\"  In 1867, a drink came into vogue, inspired by Pearl, dubbed the \"Tears of Cora Pearl.\"{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=34-35}} Alfred Delvau wrote a tribute to Pearl in ''Les Plaisirs de Paris'' (1867): \"You are today, Madame, the renown, the preoccupation, the scandal and the toast of Paris. Everywhere they talk only of you...\"\n\n== Decline ==\n=== Scandal: ''L'affaire Duval'' ===\nAt age thirty-seven, Pearl found herself involved in an incident that would result in an irreversible downturn in her fortunes. She had become embroiled in a relationship with a wealthy young man, Alexandre Duval, ten years her junior.  His obsession with her was so intense, he spent his entire fortune on sustaining his liaison with her\u2014giving her jewels, fine horses and money. It was reported that at one point Duval gave her an exquisitely bound book, a hundred-page volume where each page was bookmarked by a one thousand franc bill. Pearl ultimately dismissed him, a finality that Duval could not countenance. On 19 December 1872, Duval went to her home, it is believed, with the intention of killing her. The gun he brought accidentally discharged, wounding him. Initially near death, he eventually recovered. Nevertheless, the consequences of what had occurred proved disastrous for Cora Pearl\u2019s reputation. Publicized as ''l'affaire Duval'', the scandal caused the authorities to order Pearl to leave the country.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|p=36}}\n\nShe was expelled from Paris and left for London and later moved to Monaco and Nice. The contents of her Paris home were sold.\n\n=== Financial woes ===\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 brought at its end a new French republic and a cultural as well as political shift. The era in which Pearl had achieved her greatest success was over. The [[Third French Republic]] saw a diminution of aristocratic privilege and a resurgence of conservative values. She was no longer able to attract the titled men who had been her prime clients. In 1874, her long tenure as the mistress of Prince Napoleon ended at his request. He wrote her a touching, carefully worded letter of regret; he could no longer sustain the emotional and professional toll the relationship required of him.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=37}}\n\nPearl was slowly forced to liquidate the fortune she had accumulated. While not destitute, by 1880 her financial situation had become dire. In 1873, she sold her rue Chaillot home. By 1883, she had returned to common prostitution, taking an apartment above the shop of a coachbuilder on the avenue [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], where she received clients. In July 1885, she was forced to sell her chateau in the Loiret.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=37-38}}\n\nHer reduced finances did not abate her passion for gambling. Habitually committed to playing for large stakes, she was now restricted to betting modest amounts. Julian Arnold, an old acquaintance, encountered Pearl outside a casino in [[Monte Carlo]]. He later wrote in his memoirs: \"I found a woman seated on the kerbstone and weeping pitifully. She appeared to be about fifty years of age, handsome\u2026but much bedraggled.\" She told him that she had been turned out of her apartment, her few belongings seized by the landlord in lieu of rent. She had no place to go, and she was hungry and in misery.{{sfn|Richardson|1967|pp=37-38}}\n\n==== Memoirs ====\nThe ''M\u00e9moires de Cora Pearl'' had been greatly anticipated when it became known that Pearl was writing her autobiography. Published in 1886 in Paris and subsequently in England in London. She claimed to have sent relevant pages to her former lovers, offering to anonymize their names if they paid her. In the event, most names were altered but many have now been identified.\n\nIn the early 1980s, William Blatchford claimed to have located the ''Memoirs of Cora Pearl'', which he said had been published in 1890, after Pearl\u2019s death.  Supposedly an earlier version of the book published in 1886, this volume purported to date back to an earlier date, perhaps even as early 1873. Decidedly more frank and sexually explicit than the 1886 memoirs, their idiomatic English - expressive of a provincial, unsophisticated use of the language - convinced many people of the work's authenticity when the memoirs were published by Granada under the title ''Grand Horizontal, The Erotic Memoirs of a Passionate Life''. However, Blatchford turned out to be a pseudonym adopted by the real author of the 'memoirs', [[Derek Parker]], a former chairman of the [[Society of Authors]], who later admitted that he had hoaxed Granada.<ref>PHS. \"The Times Diary.\" ''London Times'', 5 April 1983: 10</ref><ref>PHS. \"The Times Diary.\" ''London Times'', 7 March 1984: 12</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nSoon after the publication of her memoirs, Pearl became seriously ill with [[intestinal cancer]]. Her biographer Holden wrote: \"The various accounts of Cora spending her last days in dire poverty in one squalid room are very much exaggerated.\" She died on 8 July 1886. Obituary notices appeared in the London and Paris papers. Her remaining possessions were disposed of in a two-day sale in October 1886. She was buried in [[Batignolles Cemetery|Batignolles]] cemetery, (plot number 10, row 4), in a grave leased for five years. After those five years, what remained of her body was removed to an [[ossuary]] and the grave was re-used.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{citation |last1=Clarke |first1=Joseph F |title=Pseudonyms: The Names behind the Names |date=1977 |publisher=Thomas Nelson Publishers |isbn=9780840765673 |language=English}}\n* {{citation |last1=Frayser |first1=Suzanne G. |last2=Whitby |first2=Thomas J. |title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide |date=1995 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781563081316 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C |language=en|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Hickman |first1=Katie |title=Courtesans: Money, Sex and Fame in the Nineteenth Century |date=2003 |publisher=William Morrow & Company |isbn=9780066209555 |edition=First |language=English|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Holden |first1=Wilfred Herbert |title=The Pearl from Plymouth: Eliza Emma Crouch, alias Cora Pearl, with notes on some of her celebrated contemporaries |date=1950 |publisher=British Technical and General Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=edQ0AAAAIAAJ |language=en}}\n* {{citation |last1=Pearl |first1=Cora |title=The Memoirs of Cora Pearl: The English Beauty of the French Empire |date=1886 |publisher=George Vickers |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Memoirs_of_Cora_Pearl.html?id=UcYsAAAAYAAJ |language=en|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Pearl |first1=Cora |editor1-last=Blatchford |editor1-first=William |title=Grand Horizontal: The Erotic Memoirs of a Passionate Lady |date=1983 |publisher=Stein and Day |isbn=9780812829174 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7O-0AAAACAAJ |language=en|ref=none}}\n* {{citation |last1=Richardson |first1=Joanna |author-link=Joanna Richardson|title=The courtesans: the demi-monde in nineteenth-century France |date=1967 |publisher=World Pub.

The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]], to form the DSA.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">\n* {{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html|accessdate=February 8, 2010|ref=harv}}\n''The New York Times'' reported on the Convention for three other days:\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721227-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists defeat motion favoring recognition of Cuba|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1972|page=15|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721228-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title='Firmness' urged on <!-- CAPITALIZED! -->Communists: Social Democrats reach end of U.S. Convention here|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1973|page=11|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/730101-sdusa-news.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members.

In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingunion.wordpress.com|title=Talking Union: A Project of the DSA Labor Network|publisher=Talkingunion.wordpress.com|date=|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1195/walking-the-tightrope/|title=Walking the tightrope - Weekly Worker|website=weeklyworker.co.uk|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA.

In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"obit\"/> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref>Bella Stumbo.

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left-wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nThe DSA sees itself as a [[big tent]] and multi-tendency organization with members expressing a wide range of [[socialist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DemSocialists/status/860304325737926657|title=DSA \ud83c\udf39 on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/coalition_politics_and_the_fight_for_socialism_dl|title=Coalition Politics and the Fight for Socialism|publisher=}}</ref> DSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> to [[social democracy]]. Some of these views are represented in different working groups and caucuses within the DSA including the Communist Caucus and the Libertarian Socialist Caucus.\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=5 August 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=30 July 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender.

Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\".

The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States.

As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s 1984 defeat of [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] did.

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left-wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nThe DSA sees itself as a [[big tent]] and multi-tendency organization with members expressing a wide range of [[socialist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DemSocialists/status/860304325737926657|title=DSA \ud83c\udf39 on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/coalition_politics_and_the_fight_for_socialism_dl|title=Coalition Politics and the Fight for Socialism|publisher=}}</ref> DSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> to [[social democracy]]. Some of these views are represented in different working groups and caucuses within the DSA including the Communist Caucus and the Libertarian Socialist Caucus.\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=5 August 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=30 July 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law.

This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender. The DSA supports the protection of [[same-sex marriages]], but it \"views marriage as only a first step in recognizing the diversity of human relationships\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org5\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/lesbian_gay_bisexual_transgender_queer_and_intersex_rights|title=Statement on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Rights|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Socialist feminism ===\nThe DSA aligns itself with the [[Socialist feminism|socialist-feminist]] movement. The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements.

At the height of the [[Cold War]], she became sexually involved with a married government minister, [[John Profumo]], as well as with a Soviet naval attach\u00e9, [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Yevgeny Ivanov]].  A shooting incident between two of her other lovers caused the press to investigate her, revealing that her affairs could be threatening national security. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Profumo denied any improper conduct but later admitted that he had lied. \n\nThis incident discredited the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Harold Macmillan]] in 1963, in what became known as the [[Profumo affair]]. Keeler was alleged to have been a prostitute - which was not a criminal offence. Ward was, however, found guilty of being her [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] &ndash; a trial was instigated after the embarrassment caused to the government. The trial has since been considered a miscarriage of justice; a charade of the establishment to protect itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000dt9j|title=BBC Two - Keeler, Profumo, Ward and Me|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nKeeler was born in [[Uxbridge]], Middlesex. Her father, Colin Keeler (later known as Colin King), abandoned the family in 1945. She was brought up by her mother, Julie Ellen Payne, and stepfather, Edward Huish, in a house made from two converted railway carriages in the [[Berkshire]] village of [[Wraysbury]]. In 1951, at the age of 9, Keeler was sent to a holiday home in [[Littlehampton]] because the school health inspector said that she was suffering from malnutrition.{{sfn|Kynaston|2009|p=28}} She was sexually abused as a teenager both by her stepfather and his friends, for whom she babysat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29213271|title=Obituary: Christine Keeler|date=2017-12-05|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-06|df=dmy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612043214/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29213271|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At the age of 15, she found work as a model at a dress shop in London's [[Soho]]. At age 17, she gave birth to a son after an affair with an African-American [[United States Air Force]] sergeant. The child was born prematurely on 17 April 1959, and survived just six days.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nThat summer, Keeler left Wraysbury, staying briefly in [[Slough]] with a friend before heading for London. She initially worked as a waitress at a restaurant in [[Baker Street]], where she met Maureen O'Connor, who worked at [[Murray's Cabaret Club]] in [[Soho]]. She introduced Keeler to the owner, Percy Murray, who hired her almost immediately as a topless showgirl.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=55\u201357}}\n\nAt Murray's she met [[Stephen Ward]], an English [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] and artist. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made many important friends. Soon the two were living together with the outward appearance of being a couple, but according to her, it was a platonic, non-sexual relationship. In her autobiography, \"Secrets and Lies\", Keeler maintains that Ward was working as a double agent, having contact with both senior members of MI5, and the KGB to whom he was passing UK state secrets.\n\n===Profumo affair===\n{{Main|Profumo affair}}\nOn the weekend of 8\u20139 July 1961, Ward introduced Keeler to [[John Profumo]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], at a pool party at [[Cliveden]], the [[Buckinghamshire]] mansion owned by the [[William Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor|3rd Viscount Astor]]. Profumo began a brief affair with Keeler. The exact length of the affair between Keeler and Profumo is disputed, ending either in August 1961 once Profumo was warned by the security services of the possible dangers of mixing with the Ward circle, or continuing with decreasing fervour until December 1961.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|pp=49\u201353}} Among Ward's other friends, whom Profumo briefly met, was the Soviet naval attach\u00e9 and [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] officer, [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Yevgeny Ivanov]]. According to Keeler, she and Ivanov had a short sexual relationship.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=66\u201370, 86\u201387}}\n\nAfter her relationship with Profumo ended, Keeler was sexually involved with several partners, including jazz singer [[Lucky Gordon]] and jazz promoter [[Johnny Edgecombe]]. There was considerable jealousy between the two men; in one quarrel on 27 October 1962, Edgecombe slashed Gordon's face with a knife.{{sfn|Davenport-Hines|2013|pp=252\u201353, 258}} When Keeler ended the relationship with Edgecombe in December 1962, Edgecombe turned up at Ward's house in [[Wimpole Mews]] on 14 December, where she was temporarily seeking refuge, and fired five shots at the building.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|p=75}} His arrest and subsequent trial brought Keeler to public attention and provided the impetus from which the scandal known as the \"Profumo affair\" developed.{{sfn|Young|1963|pp=9\u201311}} After initially denying any impropriety with Keeler, Profumo eventually confessed and resigned from the government and parliament, causing great embarrassment to his government colleagues who had previously supported him.{{sfn|Young|1963|pp=18, 24\u201325}} These events, in the summer of 1963, brought Keeler notoriety; ''[[The Economist]]'' gave the headline \"The Prime Minister's Crisis\" alongside a picture of Keeler, with no further explanation.{{sfn|Young|1963|p=36}}\n\n===Morley portrait===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Morley portrait]] -->\n[[File:CKeeler1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Morley]]'s 1963 portrait of Keeler]]\n\nAt the height of the Profumo affair in 1963, Keeler sat for a photographic portrait taken by [[Lewis Morley]]. The photo shoot, at a studio on the first floor of [[Peter Cook]]'s [[Establishment Club]], with Morley was to promote a proposed film, [[The_Christine_Keeler_Story|''The Keeler Affair'']], that was never released in the United Kingdom. Keeler was reluctant to pose in the nude, but the film producers insisted. Morley persuaded Keeler to sit astride a [[plywood]] chair, so that whilst technically she would be nude, the back of the chair would obscure most of her body. Keeler told cartoon historian Tim Benson in 2007 that she was not nude and was, in fact, wearing knickers during the entire photoshoot.<ref name=\"chair\">{{cite web|title= Christine Keeler Photograph: A Modern Icon|url= http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/christine-keeler-photograph-a-modern-icon/|website= vam.ac.uk|access-date= 2 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110105413/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/christine-keeler-photograph-a-modern-icon|archive-date=10 January 2014|url-status=live|date= 15 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/keeler-affair-1963| title=The Keeler Affair (1963)| website=bbfc.co.uk | access-date=19 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206161416/https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/keeler-affair-1963 |archive-date=6 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe photo propelled [[Arne Jacobsen]]'s [[Model 3107 chair]] to prominence, even though the chair used was an imitation of the Model 3107, with a hand-hold aperture crudely cut out of the back to avoid [[copyright]] infringement. The chair used is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref name=\"chair\" /> The differences in the designs of the chairs are readily apparent in a side-by-side photograph.<ref name=\"chair\" />\n\n===Trials===\n[[File:Christine Keeler op weg naar het gerechtsgebouw, Bestanddeelnr 915-5221.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Keeler going to court in September 1963]]\n\nOn 18 April 1963, Keeler was attacked at the home of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and charged. At his trial, which began on 5 June, he maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who, the police told the court, could not be found. On 7 June, principally on the evidence of Keeler, Gordon was found guilty and sentenced to three years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|p=148}} By this time, Ward was facing trial on vice charges, and again Keeler was a main prosecution witness.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|pp=193\u201394}}\n\nWard's trial, which ran 22\u201331 July 1963, has been characterised as \"an act of political revenge\" for the embarrassment caused to the government. He was accused of living off immoral earnings earned through Keeler and [[Mandy Rice-Davies]], on the basis of the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments the two had made to Ward while living with him. Ward's professional earnings as an [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] were a substantial \u00a35,500 a year (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|5500|1962|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}) at the time these small payments were made.{{sfn|Robertson|2013|pp=80\u201381}} After a hostile summing-up from the trial judge, Ward was convicted, but before the jury returned their verdict, he took an overdose of barbiturates and died before sentence could be passed.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=243\u201347}} In the closing days of Ward's trial, Gordon's assault conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal when his missing witnesses were found and testified that the evidence given by Keeler was substantially false.{{sfn|Robertson|2013|pp=92\u201395, 101}} In December 1963, Keeler pleaded guilty to charges of [[perjury]] before [[Edward Anthony Hawke|Sir Anthony Hawke]], the [[Recorder of London]], and she was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, serving four and a half months in prison.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|p=252}}\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Christine Keeler on After Dark.JPG|thumb|alt=A photograph of a woman with shoulder-length brown hair facing the viewer and looking slightly to the right while wearing a white shirt with a floral print|Keeler (aged 46) discussing the Profumo affair on ''[[After Dark (TV programme)|After Dark]]'' in 1988]]\nAfter her release from prison in 1964, Keeler had two brief marriages, to James Levermore in 1965\u201366 and to Anthony Platt in 1971\u201372. There was a child from each union, the eldest being largely raised by Keeler's mother, Julie. Keeler mainly lived alone in the last couple of decades of her life. Most of the considerable amount of money that she made from newspaper stories was dissipated by lawyers. She said that during the 1970s \"I was not living, I was surviving\".{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|p=256}} She published several accounts of her life, in one of which she claimed that she became pregnant as a result of her relationship with Profumo and subsequently had an abortion.{{sfn|Keeler|Thompson|2012|pp=123, 134}} Her portrait, by Ward, was acquired by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1984.{{sfn|Summers|Dorril|1989|p=311}}\n\nIn 1988, Keeler was featured in [[Bryan Ferry]]'s promotional video for the single \"[[Kiss and Tell (Bryan Ferry song)|Kiss and Tell]]\" (originally released on Ferry's seventh solo album, ''[[B\u00eate Noire (album)|B\u00eate Noire]]'', in 1987) with Mandy Rice-Davies; this was meant to draw more attention to the song's theme.<ref>{{SongFacts detail|8268|Kiss And Tell|11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1988, she made an [[After Dark (TV programme)#Harvey Proctor and \"Open To Exposure?\"|extended appearance]] on [[Channel 4]] discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV programme)|After Dark]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Open to Exposure |series=After Dark |series-link=After Dark (TV programme) |network=Channel 4 |date=4 June 1988 |series-no=2}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 5 December 2017, Keeler's son Seymour Platt announced that his mother \"passed away last night at about 11.30&nbsp;pm\" at the [[Princess Royal University Hospital]] in [[Locksbottom]], in [[Bromley]], Greater London.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite news|last= Davies|first= Caroline|title= Christine Keeler, former model at heart of Profumo affair, dies at 75|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/05/christine-keeler-former-model-at-heart-of-profumo-affair-dies|access-date= 5 December 2017|work= The Guardian|date= 5 December 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171216174639/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/05/christine-keeler-former-model-at-heart-of-profumo-affair-dies|archive-date= 16 December 2017|url-status= live}}</ref> She had been ill for some months, suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]],<ref name=\"Davies\" /> and was aged 75.

Her meeting at a dance-club with society [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] [[Stephen Ward]] drew her into fashionable circles. At the height of the [[Cold War]], she became sexually involved with a married government minister, [[John Profumo]], as well as with a Soviet naval attach\u00e9, [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Yevgeny Ivanov]].  A shooting incident between two of her other lovers caused the press to investigate her, revealing that her affairs could be threatening national security. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Profumo denied any improper conduct but later admitted that he had lied. \n\nThis incident discredited the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Harold Macmillan]] in 1963, in what became known as the [[Profumo affair]]. Keeler was alleged to have been a prostitute - which was not a criminal offence. Ward was, however, found guilty of being her [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] &ndash; a trial was instigated after the embarrassment caused to the government. The trial has since been considered a miscarriage of justice; a charade of the establishment to protect itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000dt9j|title=BBC Two - Keeler, Profumo, Ward and Me|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nKeeler was born in [[Uxbridge]], Middlesex. Her father, Colin Keeler (later known as Colin King), abandoned the family in 1945. She was brought up by her mother, Julie Ellen Payne, and stepfather, Edward Huish, in a house made from two converted railway carriages in the [[Berkshire]] village of [[Wraysbury]]. In 1951, at the age of 9, Keeler was sent to a holiday home in [[Littlehampton]] because the school health inspector said that she was suffering from malnutrition.{{sfn|Kynaston|2009|p=28}} She was sexually abused as a teenager both by her stepfather and his friends, for whom she babysat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29213271|title=Obituary: Christine Keeler|date=2017-12-05|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-06|df=dmy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612043214/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29213271|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At the age of 15, she found work as a model at a dress shop in London's [[Soho]]. At age 17, she gave birth to a son after an affair with an African-American [[United States Air Force]] sergeant. The child was born prematurely on 17 April 1959, and survived just six days.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nThat summer, Keeler left Wraysbury, staying briefly in [[Slough]] with a friend before heading for London. She initially worked as a waitress at a restaurant in [[Baker Street]], where she met Maureen O'Connor, who worked at [[Murray's Cabaret Club]] in [[Soho]]. She introduced Keeler to the owner, Percy Murray, who hired her almost immediately as a topless showgirl.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=55\u201357}}\n\nAt Murray's she met [[Stephen Ward]], an English [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] and artist. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made many important friends. Soon the two were living together with the outward appearance of being a couple, but according to her, it was a platonic, non-sexual relationship. In her autobiography, \"Secrets and Lies\", Keeler maintains that Ward was working as a double agent, having contact with both senior members of MI5, and the KGB to whom he was passing UK state secrets.\n\n===Profumo affair===\n{{Main|Profumo affair}}\nOn the weekend of 8\u20139 July 1961, Ward introduced Keeler to [[John Profumo]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], at a pool party at [[Cliveden]], the [[Buckinghamshire]] mansion owned by the [[William Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor|3rd Viscount Astor]]. Profumo began a brief affair with Keeler. The exact length of the affair between Keeler and Profumo is disputed, ending either in August 1961 once Profumo was warned by the security services of the possible dangers of mixing with the Ward circle, or continuing with decreasing fervour until December 1961.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|pp=49\u201353}} Among Ward's other friends, whom Profumo briefly met, was the Soviet naval attach\u00e9 and [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] officer, [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Yevgeny Ivanov]]. According to Keeler, she and Ivanov had a short sexual relationship.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=66\u201370, 86\u201387}}\n\nAfter her relationship with Profumo ended, Keeler was sexually involved with several partners, including jazz singer [[Lucky Gordon]] and jazz promoter [[Johnny Edgecombe]]. There was considerable jealousy between the two men; in one quarrel on 27 October 1962, Edgecombe slashed Gordon's face with a knife.{{sfn|Davenport-Hines|2013|pp=252\u201353, 258}} When Keeler ended the relationship with Edgecombe in December 1962, Edgecombe turned up at Ward's house in [[Wimpole Mews]] on 14 December, where she was temporarily seeking refuge, and fired five shots at the building.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|p=75}} His arrest and subsequent trial brought Keeler to public attention and provided the impetus from which the scandal known as the \"Profumo affair\" developed.{{sfn|Young|1963|pp=9\u201311}} After initially denying any impropriety with Keeler, Profumo eventually confessed and resigned from the government and parliament, causing great embarrassment to his government colleagues who had previously supported him.{{sfn|Young|1963|pp=18, 24\u201325}} These events, in the summer of 1963, brought Keeler notoriety; ''[[The Economist]]'' gave the headline \"The Prime Minister's Crisis\" alongside a picture of Keeler, with no further explanation.{{sfn|Young|1963|p=36}}\n\n===Morley portrait===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Morley portrait]] -->\n[[File:CKeeler1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Morley]]'s 1963 portrait of Keeler]]\n\nAt the height of the Profumo affair in 1963, Keeler sat for a photographic portrait taken by [[Lewis Morley]]. The photo shoot, at a studio on the first floor of [[Peter Cook]]'s [[Establishment Club]], with Morley was to promote a proposed film, [[The_Christine_Keeler_Story|''The Keeler Affair'']], that was never released in the United Kingdom. Keeler was reluctant to pose in the nude, but the film producers insisted. Morley persuaded Keeler to sit astride a [[plywood]] chair, so that whilst technically she would be nude, the back of the chair would obscure most of her body. Keeler told cartoon historian Tim Benson in 2007 that she was not nude and was, in fact, wearing knickers during the entire photoshoot.<ref name=\"chair\">{{cite web|title= Christine Keeler Photograph: A Modern Icon|url= http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/christine-keeler-photograph-a-modern-icon/|website= vam.ac.uk|access-date= 2 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110105413/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/christine-keeler-photograph-a-modern-icon|archive-date=10 January 2014|url-status=live|date= 15 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/keeler-affair-1963| title=The Keeler Affair (1963)| website=bbfc.co.uk | access-date=19 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206161416/https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/keeler-affair-1963 |archive-date=6 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe photo propelled [[Arne Jacobsen]]'s [[Model 3107 chair]] to prominence, even though the chair used was an imitation of the Model 3107, with a hand-hold aperture crudely cut out of the back to avoid [[copyright]] infringement. The chair used is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref name=\"chair\" /> The differences in the designs of the chairs are readily apparent in a side-by-side photograph.<ref name=\"chair\" />\n\n===Trials===\n[[File:Christine Keeler op weg naar het gerechtsgebouw, Bestanddeelnr 915-5221.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Keeler going to court in September 1963]]\n\nOn 18 April 1963, Keeler was attacked at the home of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and charged. At his trial, which began on 5 June, he maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who, the police told the court, could not be found. On 7 June, principally on the evidence of Keeler, Gordon was found guilty and sentenced to three years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|p=148}} By this time, Ward was facing trial on vice charges, and again Keeler was a main prosecution witness.{{sfn|Irving et al.|1963|pp=193\u201394}}\n\nWard's trial, which ran 22\u201331 July 1963, has been characterised as \"an act of political revenge\" for the embarrassment caused to the government. He was accused of living off immoral earnings earned through Keeler and [[Mandy Rice-Davies]], on the basis of the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments the two had made to Ward while living with him. Ward's professional earnings as an [[Osteopathy|osteopath]] were a substantial \u00a35,500 a year (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|5500|1962|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}) at the time these small payments were made.{{sfn|Robertson|2013|pp=80\u201381}} After a hostile summing-up from the trial judge, Ward was convicted, but before the jury returned their verdict, he took an overdose of barbiturates and died before sentence could be passed.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|pp=243\u201347}} In the closing days of Ward's trial, Gordon's assault conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal when his missing witnesses were found and testified that the evidence given by Keeler was substantially false.{{sfn|Robertson|2013|pp=92\u201395, 101}} In December 1963, Keeler pleaded guilty to charges of [[perjury]] before [[Edward Anthony Hawke|Sir Anthony Hawke]], the [[Recorder of London]], and she was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, serving four and a half months in prison.{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|p=252}}\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Christine Keeler on After Dark.JPG|thumb|alt=A photograph of a woman with shoulder-length brown hair facing the viewer and looking slightly to the right while wearing a white shirt with a floral print|Keeler (aged 46) discussing the Profumo affair on ''[[After Dark (TV programme)|After Dark]]'' in 1988]]\nAfter her release from prison in 1964, Keeler had two brief marriages, to James Levermore in 1965\u201366 and to Anthony Platt in 1971\u201372. There was a child from each union, the eldest being largely raised by Keeler's mother, Julie. Keeler mainly lived alone in the last couple of decades of her life. Most of the considerable amount of money that she made from newspaper stories was dissipated by lawyers. She said that during the 1970s \"I was not living, I was surviving\".{{sfn|Knightley|Kennedy|1987|p=256}} She published several accounts of her life, in one of which she claimed that she became pregnant as a result of her relationship with Profumo and subsequently had an abortion.{{sfn|Keeler|Thompson|2012|pp=123, 134}} Her portrait, by Ward, was acquired by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1984.{{sfn|Summers|Dorril|1989|p=311}}\n\nIn 1988, Keeler was featured in [[Bryan Ferry]]'s promotional video for the single \"[[Kiss and Tell (Bryan Ferry song)|Kiss and Tell]]\" (originally released on Ferry's seventh solo album, ''[[B\u00eate Noire (album)|B\u00eate Noire]]'', in 1987) with Mandy Rice-Davies; this was meant to draw more attention to the song's theme.<ref>{{SongFacts detail|8268|Kiss And Tell|11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1988, she made an [[After Dark (TV programme)#Harvey Proctor and \"Open To Exposure?\"|extended appearance]] on [[Channel 4]] discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV programme)|After Dark]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Open to Exposure |series=After Dark |series-link=After Dark (TV programme) |network=Channel 4 |date=4 June 1988 |series-no=2}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn 5 December 2017, Keeler's son Seymour Platt announced that his mother \"passed away last night at about 11.30&nbsp;pm\" at the [[Princess Royal University Hospital]] in [[Locksbottom]], in [[Bromley]], Greater London.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite news|last= Davies|first= Caroline|title= Christine Keeler, former model at heart of Profumo affair, dies at 75|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/05/christine-keeler-former-model-at-heart-of-profumo-affair-dies|access-date= 5 December 2017|work= The Guardian|date= 5 December 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171216174639/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/05/christine-keeler-former-model-at-heart-of-profumo-affair-dies|archive-date= 16 December 2017|url-status= live}}</ref> She had been ill for some months, suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]],<ref name=\"Davies\" /> and was aged 75.

I decided that I would try to rectify this and add to the visual narrative around her. And so the project was born. It\u2019s also a very personal project.

Black takes a leave of absence from his journalism career, with the intention of writing a [[Great American Novel]] using \"the \u201cOutsiders\u201d, perhaps \u201coccult Outsiders\u201d\u2014whom he is on the trail of across New England\u2014as a metaphor for social outsiders\".<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/04/23/alan-moore-writes-a-gay-jewish-protagonist-for-providence-to-address-lovecrafts-prejudices/ |title=Alan Moore Writes A Gay, Jewish Protagonist For Providence To Address Lovecraft\u2019s Prejudices |publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]] |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=22 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n===I: The Yellow Sign===\nGay, Jewish [[New York Herald|''Herald'']] reporter and aspiring novelist, Robert Black, is sent by his editor, Mr Posey, to '[[Yellow journalism|scare up]]' a story about an infamous book called [[The King In Yellow|''Sous Le Monde'']], which is rumoured to drive its readers insane. He goes to visit one Doctor Alvarez who once wrote an essay on the subject. Arriving at Alvarez's tenement, the door is answered by the man's landlady and lover, Mrs Ortega, who shows him upstairs. In Alvarez's [[Cool Air|heavily air-conditioned apartment]], Robert learns that the book mentions 'an early Arab alchemical text' known as ''Kitab Al-Hikmah Al-Najmiyya'' (\"The Book of Starry Wisdom\"), which describes methods of [[Immortality|prolonging life]]. He also learns that Alvaraz was provided with a transcript by a man called [[The Horror at Red Hook|Suydam]]. Feeling inspired and intrigued by this story, Robert returns to his office where he learns that his jilted lover, Jonathan, has committed suicide in one of New York's [[The Repairer of Reputations|Lethal Chambers]].\n\n===II: The Hook===\nInspired to write his [[Great American Novel|novel]], Robert goes on sabbatical from the ''Herald'' and heads to [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] in search of Suydam. Mr Posey puts him in touch with Detective Tom Malone, who shows him the [[Church (building)|church]] where Suydam lectures on [[Occult|occult philosophy]]. They stake out the churchyard where Suydam often walks, and Malone makes it clear that he's attracted to Robert. Suydam appears, cutting their conversation short, and Robert introduces himself as an occult scholar. Suydam invites Robert to his home to sell him some of his [[pamphlet]]s and tells him more about the ''Kitab'', a copy of which is held by his suppliers in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]]. He is then called away, and Robert sneaks into his basement where he finds a vast [[sea cave]] containing a golden [[totem]] and human remains. He is attacked by a [[Lilith|glowing female monster]] and flees, only to lose consciousness. He wakes up to find Suydam standing over him, and he tells him that he must have passed out due to a gas leak. Robert goes on his way, determined to investigate further.\n\n===III: A Lurking Fear===\nRobert checks in at the [[The Shadow Over Innsmouth|Hillman hotel]], [[Innsmouth|Salem]], to locate Tobit Boggs, the man mentioned by Suydam. He walks to the Boggs Refinery where he meets Boggs, who tells him about the occult group ''[[Cthulhu Mythos cults#Church of Starry Wisdom|Stella Sapiente]]'' and that he obtained his transcript of the ''Kitab'' from one [[The Dunwich Horror|Garland Wheatley]]. He shows him a 'rum run' tunnel [[Neonomicon|leading to a chamber connected to the sea]] where Bogg's grandfather brought in [[Deep One|fish people]] to Salem. That night at his hotel, Robert has a terrible nightmare involving his dead lover Jonathan, Tom Malone, [[swastikas]], [[gas chamber]]s and [[fish people]]. He checks out the next day, and leaves town by bus, noting that the other passengers all look like [[The Shadow over Innsmouth|fish-human hybrids]].\n\n===IV: White Ape===\nRobert gets his hair cut in [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]], and learns from his barber about local '[[medicine man]]', [[The Dunwich Horror|Garland 'Warlock' Wheatley]]. Robert walks to the Wheatleys' farm and meets Wheatley himself, who informs him that he parted ways with the ''Stella Sapiente'' sect, but that there's a copy of the ''Kitab'' in the library at [[Miskatonic University|Saint Anselm College]]. He introduces Robert to his [[albino]] daughter, Leticia, and [[Demigod|semi-human]] grandson, [[The Dunwich Horror|Willard]]. Willard takes an instant dislike to Robert, having perceived that Robert is \"[[Metatextuality|aht uv a diff'run' story awlduhgethuh]]\". He leaves Robert in his shed and, unbenknowst to Robert, intends to feed him to his [[The Dunwich Horror|invisible, monster brother]]. Aware of Robert's danger, Garland Wheatley sees him off the property and warns him not to cut across the fields on his way back to town.\n\n===V: In The Walls===\nRobert gets a ride with a Mr Jenkins to [[Arkham|Manchester, New Hampshire]], where to intends to visit Saint Anselm College to read its copy of the ''Kitab''. He's shown around the college by Father Walter Race who tells him there are government agents in the area investigating a [[The Color Out of Space|fallen meteorite]]. He also meets an assistant from the medical department, [[Herbert West|Hector North]], who invites him to stay with him and his [[LGBT slang|'friend']], James Montague, if he fails to find lodgings in Goffs Falls. On the way to find lodgings he meets [[The Thing on the Doorstep#Asenath Waite Derby|precociously intelligent thirteen-year-old, Elspeth]], who suggests he tries [[The Dreams in the Witch House|Mrs Macey's boarding house]]. Robert rents a room then visits Agent Frank Stubbs and his men who are investigating where the meteorite came down. Going to bed that night, Robert experiences terrifying [[false awakening]] nightmares involving Mrs Macey and a [[Familiar spirit|rat-like version]] of Mr Jenkins. He packs his bags and goes to Hector North's house, [[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator|unaware of his new danger.]]\n\n===VI: Out Of Time===\nRobert wakes from bad dreams, and James cooks breakfast for him and Hector. James and Hector argue over Hector's desire to [[Resurrection|kill Robert and reanimate him]], but Robert [[Double entendre|mistakes their bickering for James being sexually jealous]]. Elspeth delivers a message from the college to their front door, which alarms James and Hector enough that they pack and leave town immediately. Elspeth walks Robert back to Saint Anselm College, and suggests they meet again later. Father Race takes Robert to meet [[The Dunwich Horror|Dr Henry Wantage]], who guides him to the library and shows him a photograph of the members of ''Stella Sapiente'', which includes the late Edgar Wade, Elspeth's father. Robert reads the ''Kitab'', and his perception of time becomes distorted. He parts company with Wantage and finds Elspeth waiting for him. She takes him back to her lodgings and [[The Thing on the Doorstep|the Being that possesses Elspeth]] swaps bodies with Robert and rapes him in Elspeth's body. Afterwards, the Being swaps bodies back again and 'Elspeth' sends a traumatized Robert on his way. Running through the rain, a car passes him in which he can see [[Time loop|Mr Jenkins driving him into Manchester for the first time]].\n\n===VII: The Picture===\nRobert finds himself in the middle of a riot during the [[Boston Police Strike]]. An off-duty policeman, Eamon O'Brien, shows him to the home of artist and photographer, [[Pickman's Model|Ronald Underwood Pitman]], who took the photograph of the members of ''Stella Sapiente'' at Saint Anselm College. O'Brien stays for a drink and Pitman puts up Robert for the night. The next day, Pitman reveals some of the identities of the people in the photograph to Robert. Robert catches a glimpse of one of Pitman's horrific paintings of [[ghoul]]s attacking commuters on a subway, and Pitman offers to show him his 'technique' in the hope it will make Robert better understand his perilous situation. He takes him down to his basement and introduces him to a ghoul called King George. Afterwards, Robert convinces himself that Pitman has merely demonstrated the same form of [[Suggestion|hypnotic suggestion]] which he believes Elspeth must have used on him. Pitman realizes he's failed to make Robert understand the truth, and suggests he visit local author, [[Randolph Carter|Randall Carver]], whom he hopes might do a better job. Robert bids him a fond farewell and heads on his way. Pitman goes into his [[dark room]] and develops a photograph of three ghouls posing with the dead body of Eamon O'Brien.\n\n===VIII: The Key===\nRobert has spent several weeks staying with Randall Carver discussing the relationship between [[dreams]] and [[art]]. He has also discovered, in an amateur publication called ''Pine Cones'', a writer of [[weird fiction]] he particularly admires named [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Carver demonstrates to Robert the power of dreams by taking him into [[Dream Cycle|the Dreamlands]] where they meet a group of [[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath|cats who carry them up towards the moon]] before they are snatched and dropped by a flock of [[Nightgaunt]]s. On waking, Carver takes Robert into town to a literary event with [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]] as its guest speaker. To Robert's delight, one of the other attendees is none other than [[H. P. Lovecraft|Howard Lovecraft]] himself. The unwitting Robert introduces himself to Lovecraft, and it becomes ominously apparent that their meeting has been [[Destiny|pre-ordained by dark forces]].\n\n===IX: Outsiders===\nRobert arrives in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to meet [[From Beyond (short story)|Henry Annesley, a scientist who has developed a pair of spectacles through which he can see the extra-dimensional organisms which overlap our plane of reality]]. Annesley, a member of ''Stella Sapiente'', tells Robert some of the group's history, and introduces him to [[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward|Howard Charles, a young genealogist]]. Annesley observes that Robert and Howard are sexually attracted to each other, and suggests Howard show Robert some of the local landmarks associated with the 'Stell Saps'. Howard takes Robert to St. John's Church [[The Haunter of the Dark|where occult meetings were once held in the steeple]]. They go inside and discover a [[The Haunter of the Dark|shining trapezohedron]] in a box, in fact the very same [[The Color out of Space|meteorite that fell to earth in Manchester]]. Howard seduces Robert, and they have sex while looking into the alien stone. Afterwards, Robert calls on H. P. Lovecraft at his home. Lovecraft helps Robert find lodgings, and then Robert accompanies him to visit his mother in the mental hospital. Robert waits while Lovecraft sees his mother and pretends not to overhear their exchange. Lovecraft rejoins him and they depart. Lovecraft's mother looks on after them, and sees the same weird creatures in the air that Annesley does through his spectacles.\n\n===X: The Haunted Palace===\nRobert and Lovecraft discuss how [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] and [[Lord Dunsany|Dunsany]] influenced Lovecraft's early work, and Lovecraft admits that reading about Robert's strange experiences in his [[commonplace book]] has inspired him further. Robert's liking for Lovecraft evaporates when he expresses both his [[homophobia]] and [[antisemitism]], and he soon comes to realize that the unwitting Lovecraft's father, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, and maternal grandfather, Whipple Van Buren Phillips, were both members of ''Stella Sapiente''. Believing that Lovecraft has been ordained by the occult group to be their 'Redeemer', Robert panics and returns to his lodgings. He writes a letter to Tom Malone in which he warns him about everything he has discovered on his travels, unaware that the steeple window of St. John's Church appears to be getting nearer and nearer his own. Suddenly, [[Neonomicon|Johnny Carcosa]] (an [[avatar]] of [[Nyarlathotep]]) appears in the room and confirms that Robert has helped to fulfill a [[prophecy]] in which H. P. Lovecraft's stories will bring about the [[apocalypse]]. In gratitude, Carcosa kneels before Robert and [[Fellatio|fellates]] him.\n\n===XI: The Unnameable===\nRobert takes the train back to New York and mails the letter to Malone before going to commit suicide in the same [[gas chamber|Lethal Chamber]] as his former lover, Jonathan. H.P. Lovecraft's career gains momentum and all his stories merge with reality: Tom Malone goes mad after the events of ''[[The Horror at Red Hook]]''; Lovecraft marries; the events of ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'', ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'', ''[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]'' and ''[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]'' play out; Lovecraft makes the acquaintance of [[August Derleth]]; [[Robert E. Howard]] shoots himself; Lovecraft dies and Derleth becomes his [[executor]] rather than [[R. H. Barlow|Robert Barlow]]; in the 1970s, [[hippies]] discover Lovecraft's work; the ''Kitab'' is marketed as the 'real' ''Necronomicon''; belief in the [[occult]] power of the ''Necronomicon'' spreads; [[Cthulhu]] [[plushies]] go on sale. Then the events of ''[[Alan Moore's The Courtyard|The Courtyard]]'' and ''[[Neonomicon]]'' come to pass... and then the [[Cthulhu|Cthulian apocalypse]] begins.\n\n===XII: The Book===\nAt the FBI, [[Alan Moore's The Courtyard|Carl Perlman]] concludes that all Lovecraft's fiction, its [[Literary criticism|criticism]] and Robert Black's testament have acted as the conduit through which an outside force has taken purchase on humanity's [[collective unconscious]] to a point where it can change reality. Word has reached the FBI that a pregnant-looking [[Neonomicon|Merril Brears]] has sprung [[Alan Moore's The Courtyard|Aldo Sax]] from his asylum, and Perlman wonders if they might find them at St Anselm College. He drives to Manchester but instead finds himself in '[[Lovecraft Country]]'. At [[Miskatonic University]], he learns that Brears and Sax have been and gone, and taken the ''[[Necronomicon|Kitab]]'' with them. Continuing on foot to [[Arkham]], he finds a delegation waiting which includes Brears, Sax, some [[Mi-Go]], a woman 'housing' a member of the [[Great Race of Yith]], and Lovecraftian scholar [[S. T. Joshi]]. In the sky above them floats [[Azathoth]]. Johnny Carcosa appears, and Brears goes into [[Childbirth|labour]], giving birth to the infant [[Cthulhu]]. Carcosa sets the babe into the river as Brears, Perlman and Joshi look on from the bridge.

Black takes a leave of absence from his journalism career, with the intention of writing a [[Great American Novel]] using \"the \u201cOutsiders\u201d, perhaps \u201coccult Outsiders\u201d\u2014whom he is on the trail of across New England\u2014as a metaphor for social outsiders\".<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/04/23/alan-moore-writes-a-gay-jewish-protagonist-for-providence-to-address-lovecrafts-prejudices/ |title=Alan Moore Writes A Gay, Jewish Protagonist For Providence To Address Lovecraft\u2019s Prejudices |publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]] |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=22 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n===I: The Yellow Sign===\nGay, Jewish [[New York Herald|''Herald'']] reporter and aspiring novelist, Robert Black, is sent by his editor, Mr Posey, to '[[Yellow journalism|scare up]]' a story about an infamous book called [[The King In Yellow|''Sous Le Monde'']], which is rumoured to drive its readers insane. He goes to visit one Doctor Alvarez who once wrote an essay on the subject. Arriving at Alvarez's tenement, the door is answered by the man's landlady and lover, Mrs Ortega, who shows him upstairs. In Alvarez's [[Cool Air|heavily air-conditioned apartment]], Robert learns that the book mentions 'an early Arab alchemical text' known as ''Kitab Al-Hikmah Al-Najmiyya'' (\"The Book of Starry Wisdom\"), which describes methods of [[Immortality|prolonging life]]. He also learns that Alvaraz was provided with a transcript by a man called [[The Horror at Red Hook|Suydam]]. Feeling inspired and intrigued by this story, Robert returns to his office where he learns that his jilted lover, Jonathan, has committed suicide in one of New York's [[The Repairer of Reputations|Lethal Chambers]].\n\n===II: The Hook===\nInspired to write his [[Great American Novel|novel]], Robert goes on sabbatical from the ''Herald'' and heads to [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] in search of Suydam. Mr Posey puts him in touch with Detective Tom Malone, who shows him the [[Church (building)|church]] where Suydam lectures on [[Occult|occult philosophy]]. They stake out the churchyard where Suydam often walks, and Malone makes it clear that he's attracted to Robert. Suydam appears, cutting their conversation short, and Robert introduces himself as an occult scholar. Suydam invites Robert to his home to sell him some of his [[pamphlet]]s and tells him more about the ''Kitab'', a copy of which is held by his suppliers in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]]. He is then called away, and Robert sneaks into his basement where he finds a vast [[sea cave]] containing a golden [[totem]] and human remains. He is attacked by a [[Lilith|glowing female monster]] and flees, only to lose consciousness. He wakes up to find Suydam standing over him, and he tells him that he must have passed out due to a gas leak. Robert goes on his way, determined to investigate further.\n\n===III: A Lurking Fear===\nRobert checks in at the [[The Shadow Over Innsmouth|Hillman hotel]], [[Innsmouth|Salem]], to locate Tobit Boggs, the man mentioned by Suydam. He walks to the Boggs Refinery where he meets Boggs, who tells him about the occult group ''[[Cthulhu Mythos cults#Church of Starry Wisdom|Stella Sapiente]]'' and that he obtained his transcript of the ''Kitab'' from one [[The Dunwich Horror|Garland Wheatley]]. He shows him a 'rum run' tunnel [[Neonomicon|leading to a chamber connected to the sea]] where Bogg's grandfather brought in [[Deep One|fish people]] to Salem. That night at his hotel, Robert has a terrible nightmare involving his dead lover Jonathan, Tom Malone, [[swastikas]], [[gas chamber]]s and [[fish people]]. He checks out the next day, and leaves town by bus, noting that the other passengers all look like [[The Shadow over Innsmouth|fish-human hybrids]].\n\n===IV: White Ape===\nRobert gets his hair cut in [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]], and learns from his barber about local '[[medicine man]]', [[The Dunwich Horror|Garland 'Warlock' Wheatley]]. Robert walks to the Wheatleys' farm and meets Wheatley himself, who informs him that he parted ways with the ''Stella Sapiente'' sect, but that there's a copy of the ''Kitab'' in the library at [[Miskatonic University|Saint Anselm College]]. He introduces Robert to his [[albino]] daughter, Leticia, and [[Demigod|semi-human]] grandson, [[The Dunwich Horror|Willard]]. Willard takes an instant dislike to Robert, having perceived that Robert is \"[[Metatextuality|aht uv a diff'run' story awlduhgethuh]]\". He leaves Robert in his shed and, unbenknowst to Robert, intends to feed him to his [[The Dunwich Horror|invisible, monster brother]]. Aware of Robert's danger, Garland Wheatley sees him off the property and warns him not to cut across the fields on his way back to town.\n\n===V: In The Walls===\nRobert gets a ride with a Mr Jenkins to [[Arkham|Manchester, New Hampshire]], where to intends to visit Saint Anselm College to read its copy of the ''Kitab''. He's shown around the college by Father Walter Race who tells him there are government agents in the area investigating a [[The Color Out of Space|fallen meteorite]]. He also meets an assistant from the medical department, [[Herbert West|Hector North]], who invites him to stay with him and his [[LGBT slang|'friend']], James Montague, if he fails to find lodgings in Goffs Falls. On the way to find lodgings he meets [[The Thing on the Doorstep#Asenath Waite Derby|precociously intelligent thirteen-year-old, Elspeth]], who suggests he tries [[The Dreams in the Witch House|Mrs Macey's boarding house]]. Robert rents a room then visits Agent Frank Stubbs and his men who are investigating where the meteorite came down. Going to bed that night, Robert experiences terrifying [[false awakening]] nightmares involving Mrs Macey and a [[Familiar spirit|rat-like version]] of Mr Jenkins. He packs his bags and goes to Hector North's house, [[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator|unaware of his new danger.]]\n\n===VI: Out Of Time===\nRobert wakes from bad dreams, and James cooks breakfast for him and Hector. James and Hector argue over Hector's desire to [[Resurrection|kill Robert and reanimate him]], but Robert [[Double entendre|mistakes their bickering for James being sexually jealous]]. Elspeth delivers a message from the college to their front door, which alarms James and Hector enough that they pack and leave town immediately. Elspeth walks Robert back to Saint Anselm College, and suggests they meet again later. Father Race takes Robert to meet [[The Dunwich Horror|Dr Henry Wantage]], who guides him to the library and shows him a photograph of the members of ''Stella Sapiente'', which includes the late Edgar Wade, Elspeth's father. Robert reads the ''Kitab'', and his perception of time becomes distorted. He parts company with Wantage and finds Elspeth waiting for him. She takes him back to her lodgings and [[The Thing on the Doorstep|the Being that possesses Elspeth]] swaps bodies with Robert and rapes him in Elspeth's body. Afterwards, the Being swaps bodies back again and 'Elspeth' sends a traumatized Robert on his way. Running through the rain, a car passes him in which he can see [[Time loop|Mr Jenkins driving him into Manchester for the first time]].\n\n===VII: The Picture===\nRobert finds himself in the middle of a riot during the [[Boston Police Strike]]. An off-duty policeman, Eamon O'Brien, shows him to the home of artist and photographer, [[Pickman's Model|Ronald Underwood Pitman]], who took the photograph of the members of ''Stella Sapiente'' at Saint Anselm College. O'Brien stays for a drink and Pitman puts up Robert for the night. The next day, Pitman reveals some of the identities of the people in the photograph to Robert. Robert catches a glimpse of one of Pitman's horrific paintings of [[ghoul]]s attacking commuters on a subway, and Pitman offers to show him his 'technique' in the hope it will make Robert better understand his perilous situation. He takes him down to his basement and introduces him to a ghoul called King George. Afterwards, Robert convinces himself that Pitman has merely demonstrated the same form of [[Suggestion|hypnotic suggestion]] which he believes Elspeth must have used on him. Pitman realizes he's failed to make Robert understand the truth, and suggests he visit local author, [[Randolph Carter|Randall Carver]], whom he hopes might do a better job. Robert bids him a fond farewell and heads on his way. Pitman goes into his [[dark room]] and develops a photograph of three ghouls posing with the dead body of Eamon O'Brien.\n\n===VIII: The Key===\nRobert has spent several weeks staying with Randall Carver discussing the relationship between [[dreams]] and [[art]]. He has also discovered, in an amateur publication called ''Pine Cones'', a writer of [[weird fiction]] he particularly admires named [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Carver demonstrates to Robert the power of dreams by taking him into [[Dream Cycle|the Dreamlands]] where they meet a group of [[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath|cats who carry them up towards the moon]] before they are snatched and dropped by a flock of [[Nightgaunt]]s. On waking, Carver takes Robert into town to a literary event with [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]] as its guest speaker. To Robert's delight, one of the other attendees is none other than [[H. P. Lovecraft|Howard Lovecraft]] himself. The unwitting Robert introduces himself to Lovecraft, and it becomes ominously apparent that their meeting has been [[Destiny|pre-ordained by dark forces]].\n\n===IX: Outsiders===\nRobert arrives in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to meet [[From Beyond (short story)|Henry Annesley, a scientist who has developed a pair of spectacles through which he can see the extra-dimensional organisms which overlap our plane of reality]]. Annesley, a member of ''Stella Sapiente'', tells Robert some of the group's history, and introduces him to [[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward|Howard Charles, a young genealogist]]. Annesley observes that Robert and Howard are sexually attracted to each other, and suggests Howard show Robert some of the local landmarks associated with the 'Stell Saps'. Howard takes Robert to St. John's Church [[The Haunter of the Dark|where occult meetings were once held in the steeple]]. They go inside and discover a [[The Haunter of the Dark|shining trapezohedron]] in a box, in fact the very same [[The Color out of Space|meteorite that fell to earth in Manchester]]. Howard seduces Robert, and they have sex while looking into the alien stone. Afterwards, Robert calls on H. P. Lovecraft at his home. Lovecraft helps Robert find lodgings, and then Robert accompanies him to visit his mother in the mental hospital. Robert waits while Lovecraft sees his mother and pretends not to overhear their exchange. Lovecraft rejoins him and they depart. Lovecraft's mother looks on after them, and sees the same weird creatures in the air that Annesley does through his spectacles.\n\n===X: The Haunted Palace===\nRobert and Lovecraft discuss how [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] and [[Lord Dunsany|Dunsany]] influenced Lovecraft's early work, and Lovecraft admits that reading about Robert's strange experiences in his [[commonplace book]] has inspired him further. Robert's liking for Lovecraft evaporates when he expresses both his [[homophobia]] and [[antisemitism]], and he soon comes to realize that the unwitting Lovecraft's father, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, and maternal grandfather, Whipple Van Buren Phillips, were both members of ''Stella Sapiente''. Believing that Lovecraft has been ordained by the occult group to be their 'Redeemer', Robert panics and returns to his lodgings. He writes a letter to Tom Malone in which he warns him about everything he has discovered on his travels, unaware that the steeple window of St. John's Church appears to be getting nearer and nearer his own. Suddenly, [[Neonomicon|Johnny Carcosa]] (an [[avatar]] of [[Nyarlathotep]]) appears in the room and confirms that Robert has helped to fulfill a [[prophecy]] in which H. P. Lovecraft's stories will bring about the [[apocalypse]]. In gratitude, Carcosa kneels before Robert and [[Fellatio|fellates]] him.\n\n===XI: The Unnameable===\nRobert takes the train back to New York and mails the letter to Malone before going to commit suicide in the same [[gas chamber|Lethal Chamber]] as his former lover, Jonathan. H.P. Lovecraft's career gains momentum and all his stories merge with reality: Tom Malone goes mad after the events of ''[[The Horror at Red Hook]]''; Lovecraft marries; the events of ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'', ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'', ''[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]'' and ''[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]'' play out; Lovecraft makes the acquaintance of [[August Derleth]]; [[Robert E. Howard]] shoots himself; Lovecraft dies and Derleth becomes his [[executor]] rather than [[R. H. Barlow|Robert Barlow]]; in the 1970s, [[hippies]] discover Lovecraft's work; the ''Kitab'' is marketed as the 'real' ''Necronomicon''; belief in the [[occult]] power of the ''Necronomicon'' spreads; [[Cthulhu]] [[plushies]] go on sale. Then the events of ''[[Alan Moore's The Courtyard|The Courtyard]]'' and ''[[Neonomicon]]'' come to pass... and then the [[Cthulhu|Cthulian apocalypse]] begins.\n\n===XII: The Book===\nAt the FBI, [[Alan Moore's The Courtyard|Carl Perlman]] concludes that all Lovecraft's fiction, its [[Literary criticism|criticism]] and Robert Black's testament have acted as the conduit through which an outside force has taken purchase on humanity's [[collective unconscious]] to a point where it can change reality. Word has reached the FBI that a pregnant-looking [[Neonomicon|Merril Brears]] has sprung [[Alan Moore's The Courtyard|Aldo Sax]] from his asylum, and Perlman wonders if they might find them at St Anselm College. He drives to Manchester but instead finds himself in '[[Lovecraft Country]]'. At [[Miskatonic University]], he learns that Brears and Sax have been and gone, and taken the ''[[Necronomicon|Kitab]]'' with them. Continuing on foot to [[Arkham]], he finds a delegation waiting which includes Brears, Sax, some [[Mi-Go]], a woman 'housing' a member of the [[Great Race of Yith]], and Lovecraftian scholar [[S. T. Joshi]]. In the sky above them floats [[Azathoth]]. Johnny Carcosa appears, and Brears goes into [[Childbirth|labour]], giving birth to the infant [[Cthulhu]]. Carcosa sets the babe into the river as Brears, Perlman and Joshi look on from the bridge. Perlman wonders if there's anything in Black's commonplace book that might help them reverse the situation, but Brears and Joshi are skeptical. As [[Shub-Niggurath]] glides slowly towards the place where they're standing, Perlman rips the book in half and scatters its pages into the water.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=April 2016}}\nAlan Moore heavily researched the series \u2013 in a six-month period he acquired \"nearly every book of [Lovecraft] criticism that\u2019s been written\".<ref name=\"beat\" />\n\n{{cquote|But what ''Providence'' is, is an attempt to write \u2013 at least, my attempt to write what I would consider to be a piece of ultimate Lovecraft fiction, in that it will be fiction, it will be a continuation of ''Neonomicon'', it will in a sense be a prequel to that book, but it will also \u2013 slightly \u2013 be a sequel as well.

She also served as [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] from 1997 to 2002 and a [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]] for the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] from 1969 to 1989. She first rose to prominence as an academic, [[barrister]] and campaigner. She defeated [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]'s [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Fine Gael]]'s [[Austin Currie]] in the [[1990 Irish presidential election|1990 presidential election]], becoming the first Independent candidate nominated by the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] and Independent Senators. She was the first elected President in the office's history not to have had the support of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]].<ref name=\"EIpresE\"/>\n\nShe is widely regarded as a transformative figure for Ireland, and for the Irish presidency, revitalising and liberalising a previously conservative, low-profile political office. She resigned the presidency two months ahead of the end of her term of office to take up her post in the United Nations. During her UN tenure she visited [[Tibet]] (1998), the first High Commissioner to do so; she criticised Ireland's immigrant policy; and criticised the use of [[capital punishment in the United States]]. She extended her intended single four-year term by a year to preside over the [[World Conference against Racism 2001]] in [[Durban]], South Africa; the conference proved controversial. Under continuing pressure from the United States, Robinson resigned her post in September 2002.\n\nAfter leaving the United Nations in 2002, Robinson formed Realizing Rights: the Ethical Globalization Initiative,<ref name=\"real1\"/> which came to a planned end at the end of 2010. Its core activities were 1) fostering equitable trade and [[decent work]], 2) promoting the [[right to health]] and more humane migration policies, and 3) working to strengthen women's leadership and encourage [[corporate social responsibility]]. The organisation also supported capacity building and [[good governance]] in developing countries. Robinson returned to live in Ireland at the end of 2010, and has set up The Mary Robinson Foundation \u2013 Climate Justice,<ref name=\"mrfcj\"/> which aims to be 'a centre for thought leadership, education and advocacy on the struggle to secure [[global justice]] for those many victims of climate change who are usually forgotten \u2013 the poor, the disempowered and the marginalised across the world.'\n\nRobinson is Chairman of the Institute for Human Rights and Business<ref name=\"ihrbo\"/> and served as [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Dublin]] from 1998 until 2019. Since 2004, she has also been Professor of Practice in [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|International Affairs at Columbia University]], where she teaches [[international human rights law|international human rights]]. Robinson also visits other colleges and universities where she lectures on human rights. Robinson sits on the board of the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]], an organisation which supports good governance and great leadership in Africa, and is a member of the Foundation's [[Ibrahim Prize]] Committee. Robinson is also a [[The B Team|B Team]] Leader, alongside [[Richard Branson]], [[Jochen Zeitz]] and a group of leaders from business and civil society as part of [[The B Team]].<ref name=\"mrfcj2\" /> Robinson is an Extraordinary Professor in the [[Centre for Human Rights]] and the Centre for Sexualities, AIDS and Gender at the [[University of Pretoria]].<ref name=\"fires\"/> Robinson served as Oxfam's honorary president from 2002 until she stepped down in 2012 and is honorary president of the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation [[European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation|EIUC]] since 2005. She is Chair of the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED) and is also a founding member and chair of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]]. Robinson was a member of the European members of the [[Trilateral Commission]].\n\nIn 2004, she received [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]] for her work in promoting human rights.\n\n== Background ==\nBorn '''Mary Therese Winifred Bourke''' in [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]], County Mayo, in 1944, she is the daughter of two medical doctors.<ref name=\"brita\"/> Her father was Dr. Aubrey Bourke, of Ballina, while her mother was Dr. Tessa Bourke (''n\u00e9e'' O'Donnell), of [[Carndonagh]], [[Inishowen]], County Donegal. The [[Hiberno-Norman]] Bourkes have lived in Mayo since the thirteenth century. Her family had links with many diverse political strands in Ireland. One ancestor was a leading activist in the [[Irish National Land League]] of Mayo and the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]; an uncle, Sir Paget John Bourke, was knighted by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], after a career as a judge in the [[Colonial Service]]; while another relative was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] nun. Some branches of the family were members of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] while others were Catholics. More distant relatives included [[William Liath de Burgh]], [[Tiob\u00f3id mac Walter Ciotach Bourke]], and [[Charles Bourke]]. Robinson was therefore born into a family that was a historical mix of rebels against and servants of the [[British Crown]].\n\nMary Bourke attended [[Mount Anville Secondary School]] in Dublin<ref name=\"dubli\"/> and studied law at [[Trinity College Dublin]] (where she was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a scholar]] in 1965, the same year as [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]]) graduating in 1967 with first class honours,<ref name=\"tdcli\"/> [[King's Inns]] and [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=\"tcdbio\"/> She was called to the [[Bar Council of Ireland|Irish Bar]] in 1967 and while still in her twenties, she was called to the Inner Bar as [[Senior Counsel]], and was appointed Reid Professor of Law in the college.<ref name=\"bbc00\"/> A subsequent holder of that title was her successor as Irish President, [[Mary McAleese]]. An outspoken critic of some Catholic church teachings, she gave an acceptance speech in 1969, for a law-review position, in which she advocated removing the prohibition of divorce in the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]], eliminating the ban on the use of contraceptives, decriminalising homosexuality and suicide.<ref name=\"vanfr\"/>\n\nIn 1970, she married [[Nicholas Robinson (historian)|Nicholas Robinson]], with whom she had a relationship since they were fellow law students and who was then practising as a solicitor.<ref name=\"horgan_33\"/> Despite the fact that her family had close links to the [[Church of Ireland]], her marriage to a [[Protestant]] caused a rift with her parents, who did not attend her wedding. The rift was eventually overcome in subsequent months.<ref name=\"horgan_33\"/> Together they have three children. Her son Aubrey, a photographer and film-maker who is \"committed to social justice\", received media attention in 2011, when he participated in [[Occupy Dame Street]].<ref name=\"inde9\"/>\n\n==Career in Seanad \u00c9ireann==\nRobinson's early political career included election to [[Dublin City Council]] in 1979, where she served until 1983. However, she first hit national headlines as one of [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]]'s three members of [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] to which she was first elected, as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] Senator, in 1969.<ref name=\"oireachtas_db\" /> From this body she campaigned on a wide range of liberal issues, including the right of women to sit on juries, the then requirement that all women, upon marriage, resign from the civil service, and the right to the legal availability of [[Birth control|contraception]]. This latter campaign won her many enemies. She was denounced from the [[pulpit]] of [[St Muredach's Cathedral, Ballina|Ballina Cathedral]] for her campaigning for family planning rights for women in Ireland, causing distress to her parents.<ref name=\"heral\"/> Condoms and other items were regularly sent in the post to the Senator by conservative critics, and a false rumour was spread that the Hayes, Conyngham & Robinson chain of pharmacies was owned by her family (and so therefore that her promotion of contraception was an attempt to benefit members of her family). So unpopular was her campaign among fellow politicians that when she introduced the first bill proposing to liberalise the law on contraception into the Seanad, although two other members 'seconded' the initiative, political leaders did not put it on the agenda for discussion. As a Senator she served on the following parliamentary committees:\n\n*Joint Committee on EC Secondary Legislation (1973\u20131989)\n**Chairman of its Social Affairs Sub-Committee (1977\u201387)\n**Chairman of its Legal Affairs Committee (1987\u201389)\n*Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown (1983\u20131985)\n\n[[File:Civic Offices on Wood Quay in Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the Civic Offices (nicknamed the 'Bunkers').<br /> [[Dublin Corporation]] controversially built them on what had been one of the world's best preserved Viking sites, at [[Wood Quay]]. Robinson gave legal support to the leaders of the unsuccessful campaign to save the site.]]\nFor many years Robinson also worked as legal advisor for the [[Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform]], with future Trinity College Senator [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]]. Coincidentally, just as [[Mary McAleese]] replaced Mary Robinson as Reid Professor of Law in Trinity, and would succeed her to the Irish presidency, so Robinson replaced McAleese in the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform.\n\nRobinson initially served in the Irish upper house as an Independent Senator, but in the mid-1970s, she joined the Labour Party. Subsequently, ran for election to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the lower house) but her efforts were unsuccessful, as were her efforts to be elected to [[Dublin Corporation]].<ref name=\"elecs_irl\" /> Robinson, along with hundreds of thousands of other Irish people, clashed with Dublin Corporation when it planned to build its new administrative headquarters on [[Wood Quay]], one of Europe's best preserved Viking sites. Though Robinson and people who in the past might not have espoused her causes, fought a determined battle, Wood Quay was ultimately bulldozed and concreted over, to build the controversial Civic Offices.\n\nIn 1982, the Labour Party entered into a coalition government with [[Fine Gael]]. When [[Peter Sutherland]] was appointed Ireland's [[European Commissioner]], Labour demanded the choice of the next [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]]. Many expected Robinson to be the choice, but the party leader instead picked senior counsel [[John Rogers (Irish lawyer)|John Rogers]]. Rogers was a very close friend of the then leader of the Labour Party, Dick Spring. Rogers and Spring had shared rooms when they had been undergraduates at Trinity College Dublin. Shortly afterward, Robinson resigned from the party in protest at the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] that the coalition led by [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] had signed with the British Government of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Robinson argued that unionist politicians in [[Northern Ireland]] should have been consulted as part of the deal, despite their reluctance to share power.\n\nRobinson remained in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point many of the issues she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised (although heavily restricted), women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, she decided not to seek re-election to the Seanad in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her about running for President in that year's election. She thought she was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader [[Dick Spring]] was proposing. However, as she read the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.\n\n==Presidential candidacy==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Beating Noel Browne to the nomination===\n[[File:Trinity College Dublin 2.jpg|thumb|Trinity College Dublin<br />Robinson served as Reid Professor of Law in the University, as well as being one of its three elected senators in Seanad \u00c9ireann for twenty years.]]\nFew, even in the Labour Party, gave Robinson much chance of winning the presidency, not least because of an internal party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]], and a hero to the left, [[Noel Browne]]. Browne was a household name for having done more than anybody else in Ireland in tackling [[tuberculosis]] during the 1950s. However, Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short-lived [[Socialist Labour Party (Ireland)|Socialist Labour Party]] in 1977, after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left-wing members within Labour such as [[Michael D. Higgins]], he had little or no contact with [[Dick Spring]], and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for the candidacy in an election which Labour had never previously contested now acted as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not feel that he would be able to control Browne for the duration of the election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that he had had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances, the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However, she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.\n\n===Candidates from other parties===\nRobinson's campaign was boosted by a lack of organisation in Fine Gael, the official opposition party. Fine Gael had previously gambled that former [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] would run as its candidate, even though he had insisted for two years that he would not run for office. When it was apparent that FitzGerald would not budge from his refusal, Fine Gael approached another senior figure, [[Peter Barry]], who had previously been willing to run but had run out of patience and was no longer interested. The party ultimately nominated the former [[civil rights]] campaigner [[Austin Currie]], a respected new [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] and former Minister in [[Brian Faulkner]]'s power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland from 1973 to 1974. Currie had little experience in the politics of the Republic and was widely seen as the party's last choice, nominated only when no-one else was available. [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] chose [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]] [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]]. In three decades in politics, Lenihan had become very popular, and was widely seen as humorous and intelligent. Like Robinson he had himself delivered liberal policy reform (abolished censorship in the 1960s, for example).\n\nWhen the campaign began, Lenihan was seen as a near certainty to win the presidency. The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as the campaign proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach [[Charles Haughey]] and the rising popularity of the Labour Party leader [[Dick Spring]]. Notwithstanding, Fianna F\u00e1il knew they could count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.\n\n==Election campaign==\nThe head start that Robinson attained in the nomination process, and the fact that the Fine Gael candidate was from [[Northern Ireland]], resulted in Robinson attaining second place in the polls. Given that Fine Gael normally received 25% of the election result, and were reduced to third place this was an achievement in itself. She also obtained the backing of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland]] which was strong in [[Dublin]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and was considered crucial to getting working class votes. Robinson had proved superior media skills to both alternative candidates, and only now had to compete with the Fianna F\u00e1il party election machine.\n\nAt this point, a transfer pact was decided upon between Fine Gael and Labour, as both parties were normally preferred partners for each other in general elections. However, the Fine Gael candidate felt shortchanged by this deal as the media was more interested in the Robinson campaign, and privately he did not like Robinson. Currie later remarked that Lenihan was his personal friend, and that he felt personally sick at being asked to endorse somebody he did not like, for the sake of beating Lenihan. The possibility of transfers increased Robinson's chances if only Lenihan could be further weakened.\n\nIt emerged during the campaign that what Lenihan had told friends and insiders in private flatly contradicted his public statements on a controversial effort in 1982, by the then opposition Fianna F\u00e1il to pressure [[Patrick Hillery|President Hillery]], into refusing a parliamentary dissolution to Garret FitzGerald, the Taoiseach at the time; Hillery had resolutely rejected the pressure.\n\nLenihan denied he had pressured the President but then a tape was produced of an 'on the record' interview he had given to a postgraduate student the previous May, in which he frankly discussed attempting to apply pressure. Lenihan claimed that \"on mature recollection\" he hadn't pressured the President and had been confused in his interview with the student. However, the issue nearly brought down the government.\n\nUnder pressure from the junior coalition partner, the [[Progressive Democrats]], Haughey sacked the \"unbeatable candidate\" as [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Defense (Ireland)|Minister for Defense]]. Lenihan's integrity for the highest office in the land was seriously questioned. Lenihan's role in the event in 1982 seemed to imply that he could be instructed by Haughey in his duties, and that electing Lenihan was in effect empowering the controversial Haughey. In a pointless effort to weaken Robinson a government minister and Haughey ally, [[P\u00e1draig Flynn]] launched a controversial personal attack on Mary Robinson \"as a wife and mother\" and \"having a new-found interest in her family\".<ref name=\"itim22\"/> Flynn, even more controversially, also joked privately that Robinson would \"turn the \u00c1ras into the Red Cow Inn\".{{clarify|date=December 2013}} Flynn's tirade was itself attacked in response as \"disgraceful\" on live radio by [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]], a senior member of the Progressive Democrats and up to that point supporting Lenihan's campaign.<ref name=\"quote1\"/> When Robinson met McDowell later in a restaurant, she quipped, \"with enemies like McDowell<!--the quote is about McDowell. Technically he was an enemy as he was part of the government.-->, who needs friends?\" Flynn's attack was a fatal blow to Lenihan's campaign, causing many female supporters of Lenihan to vote for Robinson in a gesture of support.\n\nLenihan's support evaporated, and Haughey concluded that the election was as good as lost. Haughey distanced himself from Lenihan and sacked him from the cabinet, as he did not want any share in the blame. This had unintended consequences, as disquiet with the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation concerning Haughey's leadership increased dramatically. An episode of an [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] current affairs television programme featured Fianna F\u00e1il members in [[Roscommon]] openly attacking Haughey's leadership and character. Many canvassers now restarted the campaign to get Lenihan elected. However, Lenihan's personal confidence was shattered and although he recovered somewhat in the polls towards the end of the campaign, it was insufficient. Lenihan won the first count with 44% of the first-preference votes&nbsp;\u2014 Robinson attaining 39%.<ref name=\"elei42\"/> However, transfers from Currie proved critical and the majority of these went as expected against Fianna F\u00e1il. Lenihan became the first Fianna F\u00e1il presidential candidate in the history of the office to lose a presidential election. Robinson now became President, the first woman to hold the office, and the first candidate to be second on first preference votes to win the presidency.\n\nRobinson became the first Labour Party candidate, the first woman and the first non-Fianna-F\u00e1il candidate in the history of contested presidential elections to win the presidency. Famously, [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] broadcast her victory speech live rather than [[The Angelus (television programme)|The Angelus]]. Her first television interview as President-elect was on the RT\u00c9 children's television show The Den with [[Ray D'Arcy]], [[Zig and Zag (puppets)|Zig and Zag]] and [[Dustin the Turkey]].<ref name=\"zigzag\"/>\n\n==Presidency==\nRobinson was inaugurated as the seventh President of Ireland on 3 December 1990. She proved a remarkably popular President, earning the praise of Brian Lenihan himself who, before his death five years later, said that she was a better President than he ever could have been.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians and breathed new life into the role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect and political experience. She reached out to the [[Irish diaspora]] (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of [[Anglo-Irish relations]], when she was the first serving Irish President to visit the United Kingdom and meet [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], at [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name=\"irtim77\"/> She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], to her official residence, [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]].\n\nHer political profile changed also. [[Charles Haughey]], [[Taoiseach]] when she was elected (and who had had to dismiss her rival, [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] when the [[Progressive Democrats]], the smaller party in government, threatened to leave the government unless he was sacked) had a diffident relationship with her{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, at one stage preventing her from delivering the prestigious [[BBC]] [[Dimbleby Lecture]].\n\nIn the previous 52 years, only one address to the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) had taken place, by President [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] in 1966, on the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]]. Robinson delivered two such addresses. She was also invited to chair a committee to review the workings of the United Nations, but declined{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} when asked to by the [[Government of Ireland]], who feared that her involvement might make it difficult for it to oppose the proposals that would result. Controversially, on one trip to [[Belfast]], she met with [[Gerry Adams]], the MP for [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] and [[President of Sinn F\u00e9in]].\n\nForeign Minister Dick Spring, who was leader of the Labour Party, advised her not to meet Adams, whose party was linked with the [[Provisional IRA]]. However, the Government refused to formally advise her not to meet with him. She felt it would be wrong, in the absence of such formal advice, for her as head of state not to meet the local Member of Parliament, during her visit, and was photographed publicly shaking his hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues, including [[David Trimble]] of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[John Hume]] of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]].\n\nTo the surprise of her critics, who had seen her as embodying liberalism that the Catholic Church disapproved of, she had a close working relationship with the Church. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad regularly, and became the first President to host an \u00c1ras reception for the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]]. When on a working trip to Rome, she requested, and was granted, an audience with [[Pope John Paul II]]. The outfit she wore was condemned by a controversial young priest, Fr. [[David O'Hanlon (priest)|David O'Hanlon]], in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' for supposedly breaking Vatican dress codes on her visit; the Vatican denied that she had&nbsp;\u2013 the Vatican dress codes had been changed early in John Paul's pontificate&nbsp;\u2013 an analysis echoed by Ireland's Roman Catholic Bishops who distanced themselves from Fr. O' Hanlon's comments.<ref name=\"quote2\"/>\n\nIn one of her roles as President, the signing into law of Bills passed by the Oireachtas, she was called upon to sign two very significant Bills that she had fought for throughout her political career: a Bill to fully liberalise the law on the availability of [[contraceptives]]; and a Bill fully decriminalising homosexuality, and which unlike legislation in much of the world at the time, provided for a fully equal [[age of consent]], treating heterosexuals and [[LGBT]] people alike.<ref name=\"stanford\"/>\n\n===Popularity===\nShe invited groups not normally invited to presidential residences to visit her in \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in; from the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]], a large religious order who ran schools throughout Ireland, but had never had its leaders invited to the \u00c1ras, to G.L.E.N., the [[Gay and Lesbian Equality Network]]. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad, Irish famine relief charities, attended international sports events, met the Pope and, against pressure from the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, not to do so, was the only head of state to meet the [[14th Dalai Lama]] during his tour of Europe.<ref name=\"mylif\"/> She put a special symbolic light in her kitchen window in \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in which was visible to the public as it overlooked the principal public view of the building, as a sign of remembering Irish emigrants around the world (placing a light in a darkened window to guide the way of strangers was an old Irish [[folk custom]]). Robinson's symbolic light became an acclaimed symbol of an Ireland thinking about its sons and daughters around the world. She visited [[Rwanda]] where she brought world attention to the suffering in that state in the aftermath of its civil war. After her visit, she spoke at a press conference, where she became visibly emotional. As a lawyer trained to be rational, she was furious at her emotion, but it moved many who saw it. One media critic who had slated her presidential ideas in 1990, journalist and ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' editor [[Vincent Browne]], passed her a note at the end of the press conference saying simply \"you were magnificent.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nBrowne's comments matched the attitudes of Irish people on Robinson's achievements as President, between 1990 and 1997. By halfway through her term of office her popularity rating reached an unprecedented 93 per cent.<ref name=\"newsr\"/>\n\n===Resignation as President===\nOn 24 July 1997, Robinson announced her intention to resign as President of Ireland. The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] stated that her announcement \"was not unexpected\" and wished her \"every success\".<ref name=\"taos3\"/> She resigned by addressing a message to the [[Ceann Comhairle]] of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] and her resignation took effect from 1 p.m. on Friday, 12 September 1997.<ref name=\"oire49\"/> She resigned to take up appointment as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.<ref name=\"presi85\"/> Upon her resignation as President, the role of President of Ireland was transferred to the [[Presidential Commission (Ireland)|Presidential Commission]] (which comprised the [[Chief Justice of Ireland]], the [[Ceann Comhairle]] of [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] and the [[Cathaoirleach]] of [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]]) from 12 September to 11 November 1997, when the new President [[Mary McAleese]] was sworn in.\n\n==High Commissioner for Human Rights==\nRobinson became the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] on 12 September 1997, resigning the presidency a few weeks early to take up the post. Media reports suggested that she had been head-hunted for the post by [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]], to assume an advocacy as opposed to an administrative role, in other words to become a public campaigner outlining principles rather than the previous implementational and consensus-building model. The belief was that the post had ceased to be seen as the voice of general principles and had become largely bureaucratic. Robinson's role was to set the human rights agenda within the organisation and internationally, refocusing its appeal.\n[[File:Mary Robinson in Somalia.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Robinson in [[Somalia]], 2011]]\nIn November 1997, still new to her post, Robinson delivered the [[Romanes Lecture]] in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] on the topic of \"Realizing Human Rights\"; she spoke of the \"daunting challenge\" ahead of her, and how she intended to set about her task.  She concluded the lecture with words from ''[[The Golden Bough]]'': \"If fate has called you, the bough will come easily, and of its own accord. Otherwise, no matter how much strength you muster, you never will manage to quell it or cut it down with the toughest of blades.\"\n\nRobinson was the first High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit [[Tibet]], making her trip in 1998. During her tenure, she criticised the Irish system of permits for non-EU immigrants as similar to \"bonded labour\" and criticised the United States' use of capital punishment.\n\nIn 2001, Robinson chaired the Asia Regional Preparatory Meeting for the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and related intolerances, which was held in [[Tehran]], Iran.<ref name=\"irane\"/> At this meeting, the representatives of neither the [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]], a Jewish group, nor the [[Baha'i International Community]] were permitted to attend.<ref name=\"un126\"/> Robinson wore a headscarf at the meeting, because the Iranians enforced an edict that all women attending the conference must wear a headscarf. Women who did not wear the headscarf were criticised, and Robinson said that it \"played into the hands of religious conservatives.\"<ref name=\"belief\"/><ref name=\"bahai\"/>\n\nThough she had initially announced her intention to serve a single four-year period, she extended the term by a year following an appeal from Annan, allowing her to preside over the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|2001 World Conference against Racism]] in [[Durban]], South Africa, as Secretary-General. The conference drew widespread criticism, as did Robinson. Former [[US Congressman]] [[Tom Lantos]] said, \"To many of us present at the events at Durban, it is clear that much of the responsibility for the debacle rests on the shoulders of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who, in her role as secretary-general of the conference, failed to provide the leadership needed to keep the conference on track.\"<ref name=\"lantos\"/>\n\nRobinson's period as High Commissioner ended in 2002, after sustained pressure from the United States led her to declare she was no longer able to continue her work.<ref name=\"guard\"/> Robinson had criticised the US for violating human rights in its [[war on terrorism]] and the World Conference against Racism was widely condemned in the US for its perceived [[anti-semitism]]. [[Michael Rubin]] even went so far as to suggest in a tongue-in-cheek article that she be tried for war crimes for presiding over \"an intellectual pogrom against Jews and Israel.\"<ref name=\"natre\"/> On 9 November 2006, in [[Yogyakarta]], she attended the International Conference, then she became one of 29 signators of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], adopted for protection of rights by [[International Human Rights Law]].\n\n==The Elders==\n{{Main|The Elders (organization)}}\nOn 18 July 2007, in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Gra\u00e7a Machel]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. Mandela announced the formation of this new group, [[The Elders (organization)|The Elders]], in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday.\n\n\"This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken,\" Mandela commented. \"Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair.\"\n\nMary Robinson has been active in The Elders' work, participating in a broad range of the group's initiatives. She has travelled with Elders delegations to [[Cote d'Ivoire]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], [[South Sudan]] and the Middle East.<ref name=\"theel\"/> In August 2014, she was joined by fellow Elder [[Jimmy Carter]] during the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]], to pen an article in [[Foreign Policy (magazine)|''Foreign Policy'']], pressing for the inclusion of recognition of Hamas as a legitimate political actor, noting the recent unity deal between Hamas and Fatah when the former agreed with the Palestinian Authority to denounce violence, recognise Israel and adhere to past agreements. Robinson and Carter called on the UN Security Council to act on what they described as the inhumane conditions in Gaza, and mandate an end to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|siege]].<ref name=\"CarterRobinson\"/>\n \nOn 16 October 2014, Mary Robinson attended the [[One Young World]] Summit in Dublin. During a session with fellow Elder [[Kofi Annan]], Mary Robinson encouraged 1,300 young leaders from 191 countries to lead on intergenerational issues such as [[Global warming|climate change]] and the need for action to take place now, not tomorrow.<ref name=\"theel2\"/><ref name=\"yout\"/><ref name=\"inde25\"/> Mary Robinson was also the key note speaker at the One Young World Opening Ceremony where she highlighted the need to empower young people to participate in decision-making processes that shape their future.<ref name=\"mrfcj32\"/><ref name=\"oneyo\"/>\n\nIt was announced on 1 November 2018 that Robinson had been appointed as the Chair of The Elders, succeeding [[Kofi Annan]] who had died earlier in the year.<ref name=\"theel88\"/>\n\n==University of Dublin==\nRobinson is the twenty fourth, and first female, [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[University of Dublin]] (i.e. Trinity College). She represented the University in the Seanad, for over twenty years and held the Reid Chair in Law.\n\n==Post president period==\n[[File:Mary Robinson World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|thumb|Robinson during the [[World Economic Forum]] 2013]]\n\n===Memoirs===\nIn September 2012, Robinson's memoir ''Everybody Matters'' was published with [[Hodder & Stoughton]].<ref name=\"irpub09\"/>\n\n===Archive and Tax Avoidance Controversy===\nIn October 2016, it was revealed in the media that Robinson was planning to donate her archive to [[Mayo County Council]], as part of the development of The Mary Robinson Centre, and had applied to have the archive designated under the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, potentially resulting in a personal tax credit to her worth over \u20ac2m, arising from the donation of her personal papers. The house proposed to be used for the centre was to be purchased from the brother of Mary Robinson for \u20ac665,000.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\nThe website of the Mary Robinson Centre lists the contents of the proposed archive (valued at \u20ac2.5m) as including:\n\"2,000 books on law and Human Rights 3,800 periodicals; A Master File of the President's engagements from December 1990 to September 1997; The symbolic light in the window of \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in from her Presidency; Robinson's personal diaries from 1967 to 1990 and from 1998 to 2001; 325 Archive Cartons..Scrap Books, Cassette Tapes.\" These papers relate to Robinson's almost 50-year career, spanning her time as a senator and barrister in the 1970s and 80s, her personal papers relating to the presidency and significant papers from the post-presidential period of her career, most notably her time with the United Nations as High Commissioner for Human Rights.<ref name=\"robcen\"/>\n\nThe project as a whole was condemned as an \"expensive vanity project\" by historian Diarmuid Ferriter.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/> A member of the fund raising committee for the Centre argued that \"Ballina is the same distance to Dublin as Dublin is to Ballina.\"<ref name=\"irit63\"/> Chief Executive of Mayo County Council, Peter Hynes (who is also on the board of the Mary Robinson Centre) stated that Robinson had a \"legacy as a politician\" and that the centre is designed to bring significant academic, tourism, education and economic opportunities to Ballina and the West. Hynes also commented that \"The west coast town (of Ballina) has considerable pride in her outstanding career and on-going global leadership and sees the proposed centre as a living institution which will focus global attention and, working in collaboration with the [[NUI Galway|National University of Ireland, Galway]], will continue the conversation on topics of fundamental importance.\"<ref name=\"robce35\"/>\n\nThe size of the potential tax windfall available to Robinson, was particularly controversial given her avowed socialist political stance and that she was the Presidential candidate and a member of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], which describes itself as \".. a democratic socialist party and, through its membership of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and [[Socialist International]], is part of the international socialist movement working for equality and to empower citizens, consumers and workers in a world increasingly dominated by big business, greed and selfishness.\"<ref name=\"labie\"/>\n\nFollowing the reporting of the potential \u20ac2m windfall, Robinson announced she would abandon the plan to \"gift\" the archive to Ballina and instead she said the papers would be \"gifted to NUIG, with Mayo County Council having full access to any part of the collection which is required to support the mission of the centre in Ballina\".<ref name=\"irit17\"/> In addition she stated that she would now not avail of the tax credit for the donation.\n\n===Activities in non-governmental organisations===\n* [[Club de Madrid]], member and former president<ref name=\"clubm\"/>\n* [[Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity|Aurora Prize]], member of the selection committee (since 2015)<ref name=\"auror\"/>\n* [[Arab Democracy Foundation]], founding member of the board of trustees (since 2007)\n* [[Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves|Clean Cooking Alliance]], Member of the Leadership Council<ref name=\"cleanc\"/>\n* [[European Climate Foundation]], board member<ref name=\"euclim\"/>\n* [[International Commission of Jurists]], head (since 2009)<ref name=\"rte97\"/>\n* Scaling Up Nutrition Movement, Member of the Lead Group (since 2016, appointed by [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]])<ref name=\"un433\"/>\n* [[World Justice Project]], Honorary Co-Chairwoman\n* Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa ([[AWEPA]]), member of the Eminent Advisory Board<ref name=\"awepa\"/><ref name=\"prusa\"/><ref name=\"allaf\"/>\n\n===Roles in international organisations===\nIn March 2013, Robinson was chosen to oversee the implementation of a peace deal to stabilise the troubled central African country of Congo. Appointed by UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], Robinson was expected to play a key role in supporting implementation of the U.N.-drafted peace deal signed by 11 African countries in late February 2013.<ref name=\"edmon\"/>\n\nIn July 2014, Ban Ki-moon made Robinson his special envoy for Climate Change to interact with global leaders ahead of the 2014 [[2014 UN Climate Summit|Climate Summit]], in New York, at which the secretary-general said he hoped to forge political commitment to finalising an agreement in 2015.<ref name=\"ClimateChange\"/> In March 2015, she voiced support for [[fossil fuel divestment]] commenting \"it is almost a due diligence requirement to consider ending investment in dirty energy companies\".<ref name=\"UN climate envoy backs fossil fuel divestment movement\"/>\n\nIn early 2016, Robinson was appointed by [[Erik Solheim]], the Chairman of the [[Development Assistance Committee]], to head a high-level panel on the future of the Development Assistance Committee.<ref name=\"oecd4\"/>\n\nIn May 2016, Ban Ki-moon appointed Robinson and [[Macharia Kamau]], as special envoys of the Secretary-General on El Ni\u00f1o and Climate, tasking them with calling attention to the people around the world affected by severe El Ni\u00f1o-linked drought and climate impacts, and mobilising an integrated response that takes preparedness for future climatic events into account.<ref name=\"secg\"/>\n\nIn September 2016, Robinson was appointed by Ban Ki-moon to serve as member of the lead group of the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement.<ref name=\"un433\" />\n\nIn December 2018, Robinson was criticised by human rights organisations, [[Detained in Dubai]] and Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, for her statements regarding Dubai's [[Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum (II)|Sheikha Latifa]]'s disappearance and escape attempt. After meeting Princess Latifa at a family lunch on invitation of Dubai's royal family, Robinson described Latifa to the BBC as a \"troubled young woman\" who regretted an earlier video in which she alleged being confined and tortured in Dubai. Detained in Dubai head [[Radha Stirling]] expressed astonishment at the former UN commissioner for repeatedly reciting a single statement from Dubai's official version of the events, \"loving care of her family\", and for dismissing Latifa's alleged attempt to escape from Dubai in February 2018.<ref name=\"bbc99\" />\n\n==Recognition==\nOver the course of her career, Robinson has been awarded with numerous honours, including the following:\n\n* 1993 \u2013 [[New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal]].<ref name=\"dpmc4\"/>\n* 1997 \u2013 [[North-South Prize]].<ref name=\"coeint\" />\n* 1998 \u2013 [[Four Freedoms Award#Freedom Medal|Freedom Medal]]\n* 1999 \u2013 [[Erasmus Prize]]\n* 2000 \u2013 [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize]] by [[UNESCO]]\n* 2002 \u2013 [[Sydney Peace Prize]]\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Otto Hahn Peace Medal]] in Gold of the United Nations Association of Germany\n* 2005 \u2013 Jack P.

As a former Head of State and in recognition of her significant contribution towards human rights she was awarded the honour of Dame Grand Cross of Merit.\n\n===Honorary degrees===\nIn 1991 and in 2001, Robinson was awarded honorary doctorates by [[Brown University]], [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa|Lisbon Nova University]]. On 22 January 2000, she received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Law at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden.<ref name=\"uuse\"/> In 2004, she was awarded an Honorary Degree by [[McGill University]].<ref name=\"mcgill\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Robinson was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the [[University of Bath]], at the 1100th anniversary celebration of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, where she gave a lecture entitled \"Realising rights: the role of religion in human rights in the future\".<ref name=\"bathac\"/>\n\n===U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom===\n{{Section too long|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Mary Robinson, Barack Obama 2009.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Robinson receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from [[Barack Obama]]]]\nIn July 2009, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian honour awarded by the United States.<ref name=\"whitgo\"/><ref name=\"irit45\"/> In presenting the award to Robinson, U.S. President Barack Obama said \"Mary Robinson learned early on what it takes to make sure all voices are heard. As a crusader for women and those without a voice in Ireland, Mary Robinson was the first woman elected President of Ireland, before being appointed U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. When she traveled abroad as President, she would place a light in her window that would draw people of Irish descent to pass by below. Today, as an advocate for the hungry and the hunted, the forgotten and the ignored, Mary Robinson has not only shone a light on human suffering, but illuminated a better future for our world.\"<ref name=\"whitgo3\"/>\n\nAmnesty International congratulated Mary Robinson on being named as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \"Mary Robinson has long defended the rights of the underdog and has never shirked from speaking truth to power,\" said Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International. \"As an outspoken, passionate and forceful advocate for human rights and human dignity in all regions of the world, Mary Robinson has helped countless individuals from Sierra Leone to Rwanda to the Balkans to Somalia and to the Middle East,\" she continued.<ref name=\"amnes\"/> Nelson Mandela<ref name=\"RR\" /> and Graca Machel<ref name=\"RR\" /> also congratulated Robinson on her acceptance of the award.\n\nThe award was criticised by some American and European Jewish groups, while other groups offered support for the award. Parties opposed to the award included [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee|AIPAC]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the European Jewish Congress, and [[John R. Bolton]].<ref name=\"JPRob\" /> John R. Bolton, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that those in the administration who recommended her either ignored her anti-Israel history, or missed it entirely.<ref name=\"wsjco\"/> On the other hand, a group of Israeli human rights organisations including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'Tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, Physicians for Human Rights and Yesh Din, stated \"as leaders of a sector within Israeli civil society that monitors and often criticizes government and military policy for violating human rights, we do not see such actions as plausible reason for denying Mrs. Robinson the award.\"<ref name=\"JPRob\" /> In response to the protests by some Jewish groups and commentators, Robinson said she was \"surprised and dismayed\" and that \"this is old, recycled, untrue stuff,\" \"I have been very critical of the Palestinian side. My conduct continues to be on the side of tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination,\" Robinson said.<ref name=\"nyt56\"/> \"There's a lot of bullying by certain elements of the Jewish community. They bully people who try to address the severe situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Archbishop Desmond Tutu gets the same criticism,\" Robinson also said.<ref name=\"Bt554\"/> In an open letter to Robinson, [[Hillel Neuer]], executive director of [[UN Watch]], rejected Robinson's claim at being misunderstood or bullied by those who criticise her role in Durban. He said that she failed to confront purveyors of anti-Israel rhetoric. \"You may not have been the chief culprit of the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|Durban]] debacle, but you will always be its preeminent symbol\", he added.<ref name=\"JPRob\" /> When asked about the opposition to the award by AIPAC and other Jewish groups, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs replied \"Mary Robinson was the first female President of Ireland, and she is somebody whom we are honoring as a prominent crusader of women's rights in Ireland and throughout the world.\"<ref name=\"witgo7\"/>\n\nUnited States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,<ref name=\"speak\"/> United States Senate Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin,<ref name=\"durbin\"/> and some other legislators<ref name=\"mcmah\"/> welcomed the presenting of the award to Robinson.\"<ref name=\"scribd\"/> Forty-five Republican Congressmen sent a letter to President Obama raised issue with the presentation citing \"her failed, biased record as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\".<ref name=\"JPRob\" />\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, [[Nancy Rubin]], a former [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council|American ambassador to the UN Human Rights Commission]], welcomed the award and praised Robinson as a \"dedicated crusader for human rights for all people\".<ref name=\"reali\"/> [[Oxfam]] confederation also expressed its strong support for Robinson.<ref name=\"jtaor\"/><ref name=\"oxfam0\"/> The Council of Women World Leaders,<ref name=\"cwwl2\"/> the Champalimaud Foundation,<ref name=\"champ\"/> and the [[ImagineNations Group]]<ref name=\"busi5\"/> welcomed the presentation of the Medal of Freedom to Robinson.\n\nThe [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]] congratulated Robinson, saying she \"helped advance recognition of the human rights of LGBT people in her capacity as President of Ireland and as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

The PDs threatened to quit the government after the revelations about Lenihan. They gave Haughey an ultimatum: either hold an inquiry into the pressure placed on President Hillery, or dismiss Lenihan. Through professing loyalty to his \"friend of thirty years\" Haughey chose the latter option and dismissed Lenihan.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"elei42\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1990P&cons=194 |title=1990 Presidential \u2013 Ireland First Preference Votes |publisher=ElectionsIreland.org |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"zigzag\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1319592/|title=Zig and Zag: Best Bitz from Back Den|date=27 October 2008|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"irtim77\">[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/president-s-state-visit-to-uk-opens-up-limitless-opportunities-1.1598833 President\u2019s State visit to UK opens up \u2018limitless opportunities\u2019] ''The Irish Times'', 18 November 2013.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"quote2\">O'Hanlon also criticised Robinson for not making a [[state visit]] to the Vatican.

28 July 2013.flac|title=Mary Robinson's voice|type=speech|description=From the BBC programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', 28 July 2013<ref name=\"DID\"/>}}\n\n'''Mary Therese Winifred Robinson''' ({{lang-ga|M\u00e1ire Bean Mhic R\u00f3ib\u00edn}};<ref name=\"pres.ie12\"/> {{nee|Bourke}}; born 21 May 1944) is an Irish [[Independent politician|Independent]] politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of Ireland|seventh President of Ireland]] from December 1990 to September 1997, becoming the first woman to hold this office. She also served as [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] from 1997 to 2002 and a [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]] for the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] from 1969 to 1989. She first rose to prominence as an academic, [[barrister]] and campaigner. She defeated [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]'s [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Fine Gael]]'s [[Austin Currie]] in the [[1990 Irish presidential election|1990 presidential election]], becoming the first Independent candidate nominated by the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] and Independent Senators. She was the first elected President in the office's history not to have had the support of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]].<ref name=\"EIpresE\"/>\n\nShe is widely regarded as a transformative figure for Ireland, and for the Irish presidency, revitalising and liberalising a previously conservative, low-profile political office. She resigned the presidency two months ahead of the end of her term of office to take up her post in the United Nations. During her UN tenure she visited [[Tibet]] (1998), the first High Commissioner to do so; she criticised Ireland's immigrant policy; and criticised the use of [[capital punishment in the United States]]. She extended her intended single four-year term by a year to preside over the [[World Conference against Racism 2001]] in [[Durban]], South Africa; the conference proved controversial. Under continuing pressure from the United States, Robinson resigned her post in September 2002.\n\nAfter leaving the United Nations in 2002, Robinson formed Realizing Rights: the Ethical Globalization Initiative,<ref name=\"real1\"/> which came to a planned end at the end of 2010. Its core activities were 1) fostering equitable trade and [[decent work]], 2) promoting the [[right to health]] and more humane migration policies, and 3) working to strengthen women's leadership and encourage [[corporate social responsibility]]. The organisation also supported capacity building and [[good governance]] in developing countries. Robinson returned to live in Ireland at the end of 2010, and has set up The Mary Robinson Foundation \u2013 Climate Justice,<ref name=\"mrfcj\"/> which aims to be 'a centre for thought leadership, education and advocacy on the struggle to secure [[global justice]] for those many victims of climate change who are usually forgotten \u2013 the poor, the disempowered and the marginalised across the world.'\n\nRobinson is Chairman of the Institute for Human Rights and Business<ref name=\"ihrbo\"/> and served as [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Dublin]] from 1998 until 2019. Since 2004, she has also been Professor of Practice in [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|International Affairs at Columbia University]], where she teaches [[international human rights law|international human rights]]. Robinson also visits other colleges and universities where she lectures on human rights. Robinson sits on the board of the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]], an organisation which supports good governance and great leadership in Africa, and is a member of the Foundation's [[Ibrahim Prize]] Committee. Robinson is also a [[The B Team|B Team]] Leader, alongside [[Richard Branson]], [[Jochen Zeitz]] and a group of leaders from business and civil society as part of [[The B Team]].<ref name=\"mrfcj2\" /> Robinson is an Extraordinary Professor in the [[Centre for Human Rights]] and the Centre for Sexualities, AIDS and Gender at the [[University of Pretoria]].<ref name=\"fires\"/> Robinson served as Oxfam's honorary president from 2002 until she stepped down in 2012 and is honorary president of the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation [[European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation|EIUC]] since 2005. She is Chair of the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED) and is also a founding member and chair of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]]. Robinson was a member of the European members of the [[Trilateral Commission]].\n\nIn 2004, she received [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]] for her work in promoting human rights.\n\n== Background ==\nBorn '''Mary Therese Winifred Bourke''' in [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]], County Mayo, in 1944, she is the daughter of two medical doctors.<ref name=\"brita\"/> Her father was Dr. Aubrey Bourke, of Ballina, while her mother was Dr. Tessa Bourke (''n\u00e9e'' O'Donnell), of [[Carndonagh]], [[Inishowen]], County Donegal. The [[Hiberno-Norman]] Bourkes have lived in Mayo since the thirteenth century. Her family had links with many diverse political strands in Ireland. One ancestor was a leading activist in the [[Irish National Land League]] of Mayo and the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]; an uncle, Sir Paget John Bourke, was knighted by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], after a career as a judge in the [[Colonial Service]]; while another relative was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] nun. Some branches of the family were members of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]] while others were Catholics. More distant relatives included [[William Liath de Burgh]], [[Tiob\u00f3id mac Walter Ciotach Bourke]], and [[Charles Bourke]]. Robinson was therefore born into a family that was a historical mix of rebels against and servants of the [[British Crown]].\n\nMary Bourke attended [[Mount Anville Secondary School]] in Dublin<ref name=\"dubli\"/> and studied law at [[Trinity College Dublin]] (where she was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a scholar]] in 1965, the same year as [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]]) graduating in 1967 with first class honours,<ref name=\"tdcli\"/> [[King's Inns]] and [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=\"tcdbio\"/> She was called to the [[Bar Council of Ireland|Irish Bar]] in 1967 and while still in her twenties, she was called to the Inner Bar as [[Senior Counsel]], and was appointed Reid Professor of Law in the college.<ref name=\"bbc00\"/> A subsequent holder of that title was her successor as Irish President, [[Mary McAleese]]. An outspoken critic of some Catholic church teachings, she gave an acceptance speech in 1969, for a law-review position, in which she advocated removing the prohibition of divorce in the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]], eliminating the ban on the use of contraceptives, decriminalising homosexuality and suicide.<ref name=\"vanfr\"/>\n\nIn 1970, she married [[Nicholas Robinson (historian)|Nicholas Robinson]], with whom she had a relationship since they were fellow law students and who was then practising as a solicitor.<ref name=\"horgan_33\"/> Despite the fact that her family had close links to the [[Church of Ireland]], her marriage to a [[Protestant]] caused a rift with her parents, who did not attend her wedding. The rift was eventually overcome in subsequent months.<ref name=\"horgan_33\"/> Together they have three children. Her son Aubrey, a photographer and film-maker who is \"committed to social justice\", received media attention in 2011, when he participated in [[Occupy Dame Street]].<ref name=\"inde9\"/>\n\n==Career in Seanad \u00c9ireann==\nRobinson's early political career included election to [[Dublin City Council]] in 1979, where she served until 1983. However, she first hit national headlines as one of [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]]'s three members of [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] to which she was first elected, as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] Senator, in 1969.<ref name=\"oireachtas_db\" /> From this body she campaigned on a wide range of liberal issues, including the right of women to sit on juries, the then requirement that all women, upon marriage, resign from the civil service, and the right to the legal availability of [[Birth control|contraception]]. This latter campaign won her many enemies. She was denounced from the [[pulpit]] of [[St Muredach's Cathedral, Ballina|Ballina Cathedral]] for her campaigning for family planning rights for women in Ireland, causing distress to her parents.<ref name=\"heral\"/> Condoms and other items were regularly sent in the post to the Senator by conservative critics, and a false rumour was spread that the Hayes, Conyngham & Robinson chain of pharmacies was owned by her family (and so therefore that her promotion of contraception was an attempt to benefit members of her family). So unpopular was her campaign among fellow politicians that when she introduced the first bill proposing to liberalise the law on contraception into the Seanad, although two other members 'seconded' the initiative, political leaders did not put it on the agenda for discussion. As a Senator she served on the following parliamentary committees:\n\n*Joint Committee on EC Secondary Legislation (1973\u20131989)\n**Chairman of its Social Affairs Sub-Committee (1977\u201387)\n**Chairman of its Legal Affairs Committee (1987\u201389)\n*Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown (1983\u20131985)\n\n[[File:Civic Offices on Wood Quay in Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the Civic Offices (nicknamed the 'Bunkers').<br /> [[Dublin Corporation]] controversially built them on what had been one of the world's best preserved Viking sites, at [[Wood Quay]]. Robinson gave legal support to the leaders of the unsuccessful campaign to save the site.]]\nFor many years Robinson also worked as legal advisor for the [[Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform]], with future Trinity College Senator [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]]. Coincidentally, just as [[Mary McAleese]] replaced Mary Robinson as Reid Professor of Law in Trinity, and would succeed her to the Irish presidency, so Robinson replaced McAleese in the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform.\n\nRobinson initially served in the Irish upper house as an Independent Senator, but in the mid-1970s, she joined the Labour Party. Subsequently, ran for election to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the lower house) but her efforts were unsuccessful, as were her efforts to be elected to [[Dublin Corporation]].<ref name=\"elecs_irl\" /> Robinson, along with hundreds of thousands of other Irish people, clashed with Dublin Corporation when it planned to build its new administrative headquarters on [[Wood Quay]], one of Europe's best preserved Viking sites. Though Robinson and people who in the past might not have espoused her causes, fought a determined battle, Wood Quay was ultimately bulldozed and concreted over, to build the controversial Civic Offices.\n\nIn 1982, the Labour Party entered into a coalition government with [[Fine Gael]]. When [[Peter Sutherland]] was appointed Ireland's [[European Commissioner]], Labour demanded the choice of the next [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]]. Many expected Robinson to be the choice, but the party leader instead picked senior counsel [[John Rogers (Irish lawyer)|John Rogers]]. Rogers was a very close friend of the then leader of the Labour Party, Dick Spring. Rogers and Spring had shared rooms when they had been undergraduates at Trinity College Dublin. Shortly afterward, Robinson resigned from the party in protest at the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] that the coalition led by [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] had signed with the British Government of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Robinson argued that unionist politicians in [[Northern Ireland]] should have been consulted as part of the deal, despite their reluctance to share power.\n\nRobinson remained in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point many of the issues she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised (although heavily restricted), women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, she decided not to seek re-election to the Seanad in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her about running for President in that year's election. She thought she was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader [[Dick Spring]] was proposing. However, as she read the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.\n\n==Presidential candidacy==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Beating Noel Browne to the nomination===\n[[File:Trinity College Dublin 2.jpg|thumb|Trinity College Dublin<br />Robinson served as Reid Professor of Law in the University, as well as being one of its three elected senators in Seanad \u00c9ireann for twenty years.]]\nFew, even in the Labour Party, gave Robinson much chance of winning the presidency, not least because of an internal party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]], and a hero to the left, [[Noel Browne]]. Browne was a household name for having done more than anybody else in Ireland in tackling [[tuberculosis]] during the 1950s. However, Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short-lived [[Socialist Labour Party (Ireland)|Socialist Labour Party]] in 1977, after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left-wing members within Labour such as [[Michael D. Higgins]], he had little or no contact with [[Dick Spring]], and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for the candidacy in an election which Labour had never previously contested now acted as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not feel that he would be able to control Browne for the duration of the election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that he had had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances, the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However, she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.\n\n===Candidates from other parties===\nRobinson's campaign was boosted by a lack of organisation in Fine Gael, the official opposition party. Fine Gael had previously gambled that former [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]] would run as its candidate, even though he had insisted for two years that he would not run for office. When it was apparent that FitzGerald would not budge from his refusal, Fine Gael approached another senior figure, [[Peter Barry]], who had previously been willing to run but had run out of patience and was no longer interested. The party ultimately nominated the former [[civil rights]] campaigner [[Austin Currie]], a respected new [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] and former Minister in [[Brian Faulkner]]'s power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland from 1973 to 1974. Currie had little experience in the politics of the Republic and was widely seen as the party's last choice, nominated only when no-one else was available. [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] chose [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister for Defence]] [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]]. In three decades in politics, Lenihan had become very popular, and was widely seen as humorous and intelligent. Like Robinson he had himself delivered liberal policy reform (abolished censorship in the 1960s, for example).\n\nWhen the campaign began, Lenihan was seen as a near certainty to win the presidency. The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as the campaign proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach [[Charles Haughey]] and the rising popularity of the Labour Party leader [[Dick Spring]]. Notwithstanding, Fianna F\u00e1il knew they could count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.\n\n==Election campaign==\nThe head start that Robinson attained in the nomination process, and the fact that the Fine Gael candidate was from [[Northern Ireland]], resulted in Robinson attaining second place in the polls. Given that Fine Gael normally received 25% of the election result, and were reduced to third place this was an achievement in itself. She also obtained the backing of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland]] which was strong in [[Dublin]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and was considered crucial to getting working class votes. Robinson had proved superior media skills to both alternative candidates, and only now had to compete with the Fianna F\u00e1il party election machine.\n\nAt this point, a transfer pact was decided upon between Fine Gael and Labour, as both parties were normally preferred partners for each other in general elections. However, the Fine Gael candidate felt shortchanged by this deal as the media was more interested in the Robinson campaign, and privately he did not like Robinson. Currie later remarked that Lenihan was his personal friend, and that he felt personally sick at being asked to endorse somebody he did not like, for the sake of beating Lenihan. The possibility of transfers increased Robinson's chances if only Lenihan could be further weakened.\n\nIt emerged during the campaign that what Lenihan had told friends and insiders in private flatly contradicted his public statements on a controversial effort in 1982, by the then opposition Fianna F\u00e1il to pressure [[Patrick Hillery|President Hillery]], into refusing a parliamentary dissolution to Garret FitzGerald, the Taoiseach at the time; Hillery had resolutely rejected the pressure.\n\nLenihan denied he had pressured the President but then a tape was produced of an 'on the record' interview he had given to a postgraduate student the previous May, in which he frankly discussed attempting to apply pressure. Lenihan claimed that \"on mature recollection\" he hadn't pressured the President and had been confused in his interview with the student. However, the issue nearly brought down the government.\n\nUnder pressure from the junior coalition partner, the [[Progressive Democrats]], Haughey sacked the \"unbeatable candidate\" as [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Defense (Ireland)|Minister for Defense]]. Lenihan's integrity for the highest office in the land was seriously questioned. Lenihan's role in the event in 1982 seemed to imply that he could be instructed by Haughey in his duties, and that electing Lenihan was in effect empowering the controversial Haughey. In a pointless effort to weaken Robinson a government minister and Haughey ally, [[P\u00e1draig Flynn]] launched a controversial personal attack on Mary Robinson \"as a wife and mother\" and \"having a new-found interest in her family\".<ref name=\"itim22\"/> Flynn, even more controversially, also joked privately that Robinson would \"turn the \u00c1ras into the Red Cow Inn\".{{clarify|date=December 2013}} Flynn's tirade was itself attacked in response as \"disgraceful\" on live radio by [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]], a senior member of the Progressive Democrats and up to that point supporting Lenihan's campaign.<ref name=\"quote1\"/> When Robinson met McDowell later in a restaurant, she quipped, \"with enemies like McDowell<!--the quote is about McDowell. Technically he was an enemy as he was part of the government.-->, who needs friends?\" Flynn's attack was a fatal blow to Lenihan's campaign, causing many female supporters of Lenihan to vote for Robinson in a gesture of support.\n\nLenihan's support evaporated, and Haughey concluded that the election was as good as lost. Haughey distanced himself from Lenihan and sacked him from the cabinet, as he did not want any share in the blame. This had unintended consequences, as disquiet with the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation concerning Haughey's leadership increased dramatically. An episode of an [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] current affairs television programme featured Fianna F\u00e1il members in [[Roscommon]] openly attacking Haughey's leadership and character. Many canvassers now restarted the campaign to get Lenihan elected. However, Lenihan's personal confidence was shattered and although he recovered somewhat in the polls towards the end of the campaign, it was insufficient. Lenihan won the first count with 44% of the first-preference votes&nbsp;\u2014 Robinson attaining 39%.<ref name=\"elei42\"/> However, transfers from Currie proved critical and the majority of these went as expected against Fianna F\u00e1il. Lenihan became the first Fianna F\u00e1il presidential candidate in the history of the office to lose a presidential election. Robinson now became President, the first woman to hold the office, and the first candidate to be second on first preference votes to win the presidency.\n\nRobinson became the first Labour Party candidate, the first woman and the first non-Fianna-F\u00e1il candidate in the history of contested presidential elections to win the presidency. Famously, [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] broadcast her victory speech live rather than [[The Angelus (television programme)|The Angelus]]. Her first television interview as President-elect was on the RT\u00c9 children's television show The Den with [[Ray D'Arcy]], [[Zig and Zag (puppets)|Zig and Zag]] and [[Dustin the Turkey]].<ref name=\"zigzag\"/>\n\n==Presidency==\nRobinson was inaugurated as the seventh President of Ireland on 3 December 1990. She proved a remarkably popular President, earning the praise of Brian Lenihan himself who, before his death five years later, said that she was a better President than he ever could have been.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians and breathed new life into the role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect and political experience. She reached out to the [[Irish diaspora]] (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of [[Anglo-Irish relations]], when she was the first serving Irish President to visit the United Kingdom and meet [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], at [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name=\"irtim77\"/> She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], to her official residence, [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]].\n\nHer political profile changed also. [[Charles Haughey]], [[Taoiseach]] when she was elected (and who had had to dismiss her rival, [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] when the [[Progressive Democrats]], the smaller party in government, threatened to leave the government unless he was sacked) had a diffident relationship with her{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, at one stage preventing her from delivering the prestigious [[BBC]] [[Dimbleby Lecture]].\n\nIn the previous 52 years, only one address to the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) had taken place, by President [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] in 1966, on the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]]. Robinson delivered two such addresses. She was also invited to chair a committee to review the workings of the United Nations, but declined{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} when asked to by the [[Government of Ireland]], who feared that her involvement might make it difficult for it to oppose the proposals that would result. Controversially, on one trip to [[Belfast]], she met with [[Gerry Adams]], the MP for [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] and [[President of Sinn F\u00e9in]].\n\nForeign Minister Dick Spring, who was leader of the Labour Party, advised her not to meet Adams, whose party was linked with the [[Provisional IRA]]. However, the Government refused to formally advise her not to meet with him. She felt it would be wrong, in the absence of such formal advice, for her as head of state not to meet the local Member of Parliament, during her visit, and was photographed publicly shaking his hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues, including [[David Trimble]] of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[John Hume]] of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]].\n\nTo the surprise of her critics, who had seen her as embodying liberalism that the Catholic Church disapproved of, she had a close working relationship with the Church. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad regularly, and became the first President to host an \u00c1ras reception for the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]]. When on a working trip to Rome, she requested, and was granted, an audience with [[Pope John Paul II]]. The outfit she wore was condemned by a controversial young priest, Fr. [[David O'Hanlon (priest)|David O'Hanlon]], in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' for supposedly breaking Vatican dress codes on her visit; the Vatican denied that she had&nbsp;\u2013 the Vatican dress codes had been changed early in John Paul's pontificate&nbsp;\u2013 an analysis echoed by Ireland's Roman Catholic Bishops who distanced themselves from Fr. O' Hanlon's comments.<ref name=\"quote2\"/>\n\nIn one of her roles as President, the signing into law of Bills passed by the Oireachtas, she was called upon to sign two very significant Bills that she had fought for throughout her political career: a Bill to fully liberalise the law on the availability of [[contraceptives]]; and a Bill fully decriminalising homosexuality, and which unlike legislation in much of the world at the time, provided for a fully equal [[age of consent]], treating heterosexuals and [[LGBT]] people alike.<ref name=\"stanford\"/>\n\n===Popularity===\nShe invited groups not normally invited to presidential residences to visit her in \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in; from the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]], a large religious order who ran schools throughout Ireland, but had never had its leaders invited to the \u00c1ras, to G.L.E.N., the [[Gay and Lesbian Equality Network]]. She visited Irish nuns and priests abroad, Irish famine relief charities, attended international sports events, met the Pope and, against pressure from the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, not to do so, was the only head of state to meet the [[14th Dalai Lama]] during his tour of Europe.<ref name=\"mylif\"/> She put a special symbolic light in her kitchen window in \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in which was visible to the public as it overlooked the principal public view of the building, as a sign of remembering Irish emigrants around the world (placing a light in a darkened window to guide the way of strangers was an old Irish [[folk custom]]). Robinson's symbolic light became an acclaimed symbol of an Ireland thinking about its sons and daughters around the world. She visited [[Rwanda]] where she brought world attention to the suffering in that state in the aftermath of its civil war. After her visit, she spoke at a press conference, where she became visibly emotional. As a lawyer trained to be rational, she was furious at her emotion, but it moved many who saw it. One media critic who had slated her presidential ideas in 1990, journalist and ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' editor [[Vincent Browne]], passed her a note at the end of the press conference saying simply \"you were magnificent.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nBrowne's comments matched the attitudes of Irish people on Robinson's achievements as President, between 1990 and 1997. By halfway through her term of office her popularity rating reached an unprecedented 93 per cent.<ref name=\"newsr\"/>\n\n===Resignation as President===\nOn 24 July 1997, Robinson announced her intention to resign as President of Ireland. The [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] stated that her announcement \"was not unexpected\" and wished her \"every success\".<ref name=\"taos3\"/> She resigned by addressing a message to the [[Ceann Comhairle]] of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] and her resignation took effect from 1 p.m. on Friday, 12 September 1997.<ref name=\"oire49\"/> She resigned to take up appointment as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.<ref name=\"presi85\"/> Upon her resignation as President, the role of President of Ireland was transferred to the [[Presidential Commission (Ireland)|Presidential Commission]] (which comprised the [[Chief Justice of Ireland]], the [[Ceann Comhairle]] of [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] and the [[Cathaoirleach]] of [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]]) from 12 September to 11 November 1997, when the new President [[Mary McAleese]] was sworn in.\n\n==High Commissioner for Human Rights==\nRobinson became the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] on 12 September 1997, resigning the presidency a few weeks early to take up the post. Media reports suggested that she had been head-hunted for the post by [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]], to assume an advocacy as opposed to an administrative role, in other words to become a public campaigner outlining principles rather than the previous implementational and consensus-building model. The belief was that the post had ceased to be seen as the voice of general principles and had become largely bureaucratic. Robinson's role was to set the human rights agenda within the organisation and internationally, refocusing its appeal.\n[[File:Mary Robinson in Somalia.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Robinson in [[Somalia]], 2011]]\nIn November 1997, still new to her post, Robinson delivered the [[Romanes Lecture]] in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] on the topic of \"Realizing Human Rights\"; she spoke of the \"daunting challenge\" ahead of her, and how she intended to set about her task.  She concluded the lecture with words from ''[[The Golden Bough]]'': \"If fate has called you, the bough will come easily, and of its own accord. Otherwise, no matter how much strength you muster, you never will manage to quell it or cut it down with the toughest of blades.\"\n\nRobinson was the first High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit [[Tibet]], making her trip in 1998. During her tenure, she criticised the Irish system of permits for non-EU immigrants as similar to \"bonded labour\" and criticised the United States' use of capital punishment.\n\nIn 2001, Robinson chaired the Asia Regional Preparatory Meeting for the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and related intolerances, which was held in [[Tehran]], Iran.<ref name=\"irane\"/> At this meeting, the representatives of neither the [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]], a Jewish group, nor the [[Baha'i International Community]] were permitted to attend.<ref name=\"un126\"/> Robinson wore a headscarf at the meeting, because the Iranians enforced an edict that all women attending the conference must wear a headscarf. Women who did not wear the headscarf were criticised, and Robinson said that it \"played into the hands of religious conservatives.\"<ref name=\"belief\"/><ref name=\"bahai\"/>\n\nThough she had initially announced her intention to serve a single four-year period, she extended the term by a year following an appeal from Annan, allowing her to preside over the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|2001 World Conference against Racism]] in [[Durban]], South Africa, as Secretary-General. The conference drew widespread criticism, as did Robinson. Former [[US Congressman]] [[Tom Lantos]] said, \"To many of us present at the events at Durban, it is clear that much of the responsibility for the debacle rests on the shoulders of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who, in her role as secretary-general of the conference, failed to provide the leadership needed to keep the conference on track.\"<ref name=\"lantos\"/>\n\nRobinson's period as High Commissioner ended in 2002, after sustained pressure from the United States led her to declare she was no longer able to continue her work.<ref name=\"guard\"/> Robinson had criticised the US for violating human rights in its [[war on terrorism]] and the World Conference against Racism was widely condemned in the US for its perceived [[anti-semitism]]. [[Michael Rubin]] even went so far as to suggest in a tongue-in-cheek article that she be tried for war crimes for presiding over \"an intellectual pogrom against Jews and Israel.\"<ref name=\"natre\"/> On 9 November 2006, in [[Yogyakarta]], she attended the International Conference, then she became one of 29 signators of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], adopted for protection of rights by [[International Human Rights Law]].\n\n==The Elders==\n{{Main|The Elders (organization)}}\nOn 18 July 2007, in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Gra\u00e7a Machel]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. Mandela announced the formation of this new group, [[The Elders (organization)|The Elders]], in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday.\n\n\"This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken,\" Mandela commented. \"Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair.\"\n\nMary Robinson has been active in The Elders' work, participating in a broad range of the group's initiatives. She has travelled with Elders delegations to [[Cote d'Ivoire]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], [[South Sudan]] and the Middle East.<ref name=\"theel\"/> In August 2014, she was joined by fellow Elder [[Jimmy Carter]] during the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]], to pen an article in [[Foreign Policy (magazine)|''Foreign Policy'']], pressing for the inclusion of recognition of Hamas as a legitimate political actor, noting the recent unity deal between Hamas and Fatah when the former agreed with the Palestinian Authority to denounce violence, recognise Israel and adhere to past agreements. Robinson and Carter called on the UN Security Council to act on what they described as the inhumane conditions in Gaza, and mandate an end to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|siege]].<ref name=\"CarterRobinson\"/>\n \nOn 16 October 2014, Mary Robinson attended the [[One Young World]] Summit in Dublin. During a session with fellow Elder [[Kofi Annan]], Mary Robinson encouraged 1,300 young leaders from 191 countries to lead on intergenerational issues such as [[Global warming|climate change]] and the need for action to take place now, not tomorrow.<ref name=\"theel2\"/><ref name=\"yout\"/><ref name=\"inde25\"/> Mary Robinson was also the key note speaker at the One Young World Opening Ceremony where she highlighted the need to empower young people to participate in decision-making processes that shape their future.<ref name=\"mrfcj32\"/><ref name=\"oneyo\"/>\n\nIt was announced on 1 November 2018 that Robinson had been appointed as the Chair of The Elders, succeeding [[Kofi Annan]] who had died earlier in the year.<ref name=\"theel88\"/>\n\n==University of Dublin==\nRobinson is the twenty fourth, and first female, [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[University of Dublin]] (i.e. Trinity College). She represented the University in the Seanad, for over twenty years and held the Reid Chair in Law.\n\n==Post president period==\n[[File:Mary Robinson World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|thumb|Robinson during the [[World Economic Forum]] 2013]]\n\n===Memoirs===\nIn September 2012, Robinson's memoir ''Everybody Matters'' was published with [[Hodder & Stoughton]].<ref name=\"irpub09\"/>\n\n===Archive and Tax Avoidance Controversy===\nIn October 2016, it was revealed in the media that Robinson was planning to donate her archive to [[Mayo County Council]], as part of the development of The Mary Robinson Centre, and had applied to have the archive designated under the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, potentially resulting in a personal tax credit to her worth over \u20ac2m, arising from the donation of her personal papers. The house proposed to be used for the centre was to be purchased from the brother of Mary Robinson for \u20ac665,000.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\nThe website of the Mary Robinson Centre lists the contents of the proposed archive (valued at \u20ac2.5m) as including:\n\"2,000 books on law and Human Rights 3,800 periodicals; A Master File of the President's engagements from December 1990 to September 1997; The symbolic light in the window of \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in from her Presidency; Robinson's personal diaries from 1967 to 1990 and from 1998 to 2001; 325 Archive Cartons..Scrap Books, Cassette Tapes.\" These papers relate to Robinson's almost 50-year career, spanning her time as a senator and barrister in the 1970s and 80s, her personal papers relating to the presidency and significant papers from the post-presidential period of her career, most notably her time with the United Nations as High Commissioner for Human Rights.<ref name=\"robcen\"/>\n\nThe project as a whole was condemned as an \"expensive vanity project\" by historian Diarmuid Ferriter.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/> A member of the fund raising committee for the Centre argued that \"Ballina is the same distance to Dublin as Dublin is to Ballina.\"<ref name=\"irit63\"/> Chief Executive of Mayo County Council, Peter Hynes (who is also on the board of the Mary Robinson Centre) stated that Robinson had a \"legacy as a politician\" and that the centre is designed to bring significant academic, tourism, education and economic opportunities to Ballina and the West. Hynes also commented that \"The west coast town (of Ballina) has considerable pride in her outstanding career and on-going global leadership and sees the proposed centre as a living institution which will focus global attention and, working in collaboration with the [[NUI Galway|National University of Ireland, Galway]], will continue the conversation on topics of fundamental importance.\"<ref name=\"robce35\"/>\n\nThe size of the potential tax windfall available to Robinson, was particularly controversial given her avowed socialist political stance and that she was the Presidential candidate and a member of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], which describes itself as \".. a democratic socialist party and, through its membership of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and [[Socialist International]], is part of the international socialist movement working for equality and to empower citizens, consumers and workers in a world increasingly dominated by big business, greed and selfishness.\"<ref name=\"labie\"/>\n\nFollowing the reporting of the potential \u20ac2m windfall, Robinson announced she would abandon the plan to \"gift\" the archive to Ballina and instead she said the papers would be \"gifted to NUIG, with Mayo County Council having full access to any part of the collection which is required to support the mission of the centre in Ballina\".<ref name=\"irit17\"/> In addition she stated that she would now not avail of the tax credit for the donation.\n\n===Activities in non-governmental organisations===\n* [[Club de Madrid]], member and former president<ref name=\"clubm\"/>\n* [[Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity|Aurora Prize]], member of the selection committee (since 2015)<ref name=\"auror\"/>\n* [[Arab Democracy Foundation]], founding member of the board of trustees (since 2007)\n* [[Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves|Clean Cooking Alliance]], Member of the Leadership Council<ref name=\"cleanc\"/>\n* [[European Climate Foundation]], board member<ref name=\"euclim\"/>\n* [[International Commission of Jurists]], head (since 2009)<ref name=\"rte97\"/>\n* Scaling Up Nutrition Movement, Member of the Lead Group (since 2016, appointed by [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]])<ref name=\"un433\"/>\n* [[World Justice Project]], Honorary Co-Chairwoman\n* Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa ([[AWEPA]]), member of the Eminent Advisory Board<ref name=\"awepa\"/><ref name=\"prusa\"/><ref name=\"allaf\"/>\n\n===Roles in international organisations===\nIn March 2013, Robinson was chosen to oversee the implementation of a peace deal to stabilise the troubled central African country of Congo. Appointed by UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], Robinson was expected to play a key role in supporting implementation of the U.N.-drafted peace deal signed by 11 African countries in late February 2013.<ref name=\"edmon\"/>\n\nIn July 2014, Ban Ki-moon made Robinson his special envoy for Climate Change to interact with global leaders ahead of the 2014 [[2014 UN Climate Summit|Climate Summit]], in New York, at which the secretary-general said he hoped to forge political commitment to finalising an agreement in 2015.<ref name=\"ClimateChange\"/> In March 2015, she voiced support for [[fossil fuel divestment]] commenting \"it is almost a due diligence requirement to consider ending investment in dirty energy companies\".<ref name=\"UN climate envoy backs fossil fuel divestment movement\"/>\n\nIn early 2016, Robinson was appointed by [[Erik Solheim]], the Chairman of the [[Development Assistance Committee]], to head a high-level panel on the future of the Development Assistance Committee.<ref name=\"oecd4\"/>\n\nIn May 2016, Ban Ki-moon appointed Robinson and [[Macharia Kamau]], as special envoys of the Secretary-General on El Ni\u00f1o and Climate, tasking them with calling attention to the people around the world affected by severe El Ni\u00f1o-linked drought and climate impacts, and mobilising an integrated response that takes preparedness for future climatic events into account.<ref name=\"secg\"/>\n\nIn September 2016, Robinson was appointed by Ban Ki-moon to serve as member of the lead group of the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement.<ref name=\"un433\" />\n\nIn December 2018, Robinson was criticised by human rights organisations, [[Detained in Dubai]] and Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, for her statements regarding Dubai's [[Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum (II)|Sheikha Latifa]]'s disappearance and escape attempt. After meeting Princess Latifa at a family lunch on invitation of Dubai's royal family, Robinson described Latifa to the BBC as a \"troubled young woman\" who regretted an earlier video in which she alleged being confined and tortured in Dubai. Detained in Dubai head [[Radha Stirling]] expressed astonishment at the former UN commissioner for repeatedly reciting a single statement from Dubai's official version of the events, \"loving care of her family\", and for dismissing Latifa's alleged attempt to escape from Dubai in February 2018.<ref name=\"bbc99\" />\n\n==Recognition==\nOver the course of her career, Robinson has been awarded with numerous honours, including the following:\n\n* 1993 \u2013 [[New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal]].<ref name=\"dpmc4\"/>\n* 1997 \u2013 [[North-South Prize]].<ref name=\"coeint\" />\n* 1998 \u2013 [[Four Freedoms Award#Freedom Medal|Freedom Medal]]\n* 1999 \u2013 [[Erasmus Prize]]\n* 2000 \u2013 [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize]] by [[UNESCO]]\n* 2002 \u2013 [[Sydney Peace Prize]]\n* 2003 \u2013 [[Otto Hahn Peace Medal]] in Gold of the United Nations Association of Germany\n* 2005 \u2013 Jack P.

As a former Head of State and in recognition of her significant contribution towards human rights she was awarded the honour of Dame Grand Cross of Merit.\n\n===Honorary degrees===\nIn 1991 and in 2001, Robinson was awarded honorary doctorates by [[Brown University]], [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa|Lisbon Nova University]]. On 22 January 2000, she received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Law at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden.<ref name=\"uuse\"/> In 2004, she was awarded an Honorary Degree by [[McGill University]].<ref name=\"mcgill\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Robinson was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the [[University of Bath]], at the 1100th anniversary celebration of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, where she gave a lecture entitled \"Realising rights: the role of religion in human rights in the future\".<ref name=\"bathac\"/>\n\n===U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom===\n{{Section too long|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Mary Robinson, Barack Obama 2009.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Robinson receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from [[Barack Obama]]]]\nIn July 2009, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian honour awarded by the United States.<ref name=\"whitgo\"/><ref name=\"irit45\"/> In presenting the award to Robinson, U.S. President Barack Obama said \"Mary Robinson learned early on what it takes to make sure all voices are heard. As a crusader for women and those without a voice in Ireland, Mary Robinson was the first woman elected President of Ireland, before being appointed U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. When she traveled abroad as President, she would place a light in her window that would draw people of Irish descent to pass by below. Today, as an advocate for the hungry and the hunted, the forgotten and the ignored, Mary Robinson has not only shone a light on human suffering, but illuminated a better future for our world.\"<ref name=\"whitgo3\"/>\n\nAmnesty International congratulated Mary Robinson on being named as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \"Mary Robinson has long defended the rights of the underdog and has never shirked from speaking truth to power,\" said Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International. \"As an outspoken, passionate and forceful advocate for human rights and human dignity in all regions of the world, Mary Robinson has helped countless individuals from Sierra Leone to Rwanda to the Balkans to Somalia and to the Middle East,\" she continued.<ref name=\"amnes\"/> Nelson Mandela<ref name=\"RR\" /> and Graca Machel<ref name=\"RR\" /> also congratulated Robinson on her acceptance of the award.\n\nThe award was criticised by some American and European Jewish groups, while other groups offered support for the award. Parties opposed to the award included [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee|AIPAC]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the European Jewish Congress, and [[John R. Bolton]].<ref name=\"JPRob\" /> John R. Bolton, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that those in the administration who recommended her either ignored her anti-Israel history, or missed it entirely.<ref name=\"wsjco\"/> On the other hand, a group of Israeli human rights organisations including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Bimkom, B'Tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, Physicians for Human Rights and Yesh Din, stated \"as leaders of a sector within Israeli civil society that monitors and often criticizes government and military policy for violating human rights, we do not see such actions as plausible reason for denying Mrs. Robinson the award.\"<ref name=\"JPRob\" /> In response to the protests by some Jewish groups and commentators, Robinson said she was \"surprised and dismayed\" and that \"this is old, recycled, untrue stuff,\" \"I have been very critical of the Palestinian side. My conduct continues to be on the side of tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination,\" Robinson said.<ref name=\"nyt56\"/> \"There's a lot of bullying by certain elements of the Jewish community. They bully people who try to address the severe situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Archbishop Desmond Tutu gets the same criticism,\" Robinson also said.<ref name=\"Bt554\"/> In an open letter to Robinson, [[Hillel Neuer]], executive director of [[UN Watch]], rejected Robinson's claim at being misunderstood or bullied by those who criticise her role in Durban. He said that she failed to confront purveyors of anti-Israel rhetoric. \"You may not have been the chief culprit of the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|Durban]] debacle, but you will always be its preeminent symbol\", he added.<ref name=\"JPRob\" /> When asked about the opposition to the award by AIPAC and other Jewish groups, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs replied \"Mary Robinson was the first female President of Ireland, and she is somebody whom we are honoring as a prominent crusader of women's rights in Ireland and throughout the world.\"<ref name=\"witgo7\"/>\n\nUnited States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,<ref name=\"speak\"/> United States Senate Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin,<ref name=\"durbin\"/> and some other legislators<ref name=\"mcmah\"/> welcomed the presenting of the award to Robinson.\"<ref name=\"scribd\"/> Forty-five Republican Congressmen sent a letter to President Obama raised issue with the presentation citing \"her failed, biased record as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\".<ref name=\"JPRob\" />\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, [[Nancy Rubin]], a former [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council|American ambassador to the UN Human Rights Commission]], welcomed the award and praised Robinson as a \"dedicated crusader for human rights for all people\".<ref name=\"reali\"/> [[Oxfam]] confederation also expressed its strong support for Robinson.<ref name=\"jtaor\"/><ref name=\"oxfam0\"/> The Council of Women World Leaders,<ref name=\"cwwl2\"/> the Champalimaud Foundation,<ref name=\"champ\"/> and the [[ImagineNations Group]]<ref name=\"busi5\"/> welcomed the presentation of the Medal of Freedom to Robinson.\n\nThe [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]] congratulated Robinson, saying she \"helped advance recognition of the human rights of LGBT people in her capacity as President of Ireland and as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. She has been unwavering in her passionate call to end torture, persecution, and discrimination against LGBT people globally.\"<ref name=\"iglhrc\"/>\n\n==References==\n'''General'''\n\nMedia coverage in ''[[The Irish Times]]'', ''[[Irish Independent|The Irish Independent]]'', ''The Examiner'' (now renamed the ''[[Irish Examiner]]''), ''[[Irish Daily Star|The Star]]'', ''[[Irish Daily Mirror|The Irish Mirror]]'', ''[[The Irish Sun]]'', ''[[The Sunday Tribune]]'', ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|The Sunday Independent]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.
