It is a [[licensed production|licence-built]] version of the [[Brazil]]ian [[Embraer EMB-312 Tucano]].\n\nOn 14 February 1986, the prototype conducted its [[maiden flight]] in Brazil before being delivered to Shorts to be used as a pattern aircraft and modified to meet [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) requirements and used for trials and demonstrations. The first Short-assembled aircraft flew on 30 December 1986; deliveries to the RAF commenced during June 1988. The final example of the type was completed in 1995. Maintenance and support of the RAF's Tucano fleet was typically [[outsource]]d to several private companies.\n\nThe RAF was the Tucano's primary operator, although export sales have been achieved with the nations of [[Kenya]] and [[Kuwait]]. A handful have also been purchased and piloted by private individuals. The potential arming of RAF Tucanos to facilitate combat missions and be deployed overseas during [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] was at one point mooted. On 25 October 2019, the Tucano was withdrawn from RAF service. It has been replaced by the winner of the [[UK Military Flying Training System]] (UKMFTS) programme, under which civilian-registered [[Beechcraft T-6 Texan II|Beechcraft T-6C]]s have taken on its training duties.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Origins===\nDevelopment of the Short Tucano commenced in May 1984, following an agreement between [[Brazil]]ian aircraft manufacturer [[Embraer]] and [[Northern Ireland]] aviation firm [[Short Brothers]] to collaborate on a response to an outstanding [[United Kingdom|British]] requirement, which sought a replacement for the aging [[BAC Jet Provost]] basic trainer for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).<ref name = Fri87 /> For this purpose, the RAF had issued [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff Target 412]], defining the performance criteria it desire for a new high-performance [[turboprop]]-powered basic trainer. A [[short list]] was compiled of various aircraft that had been submitted in response; other than the Tucano, the types considered were the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Pilatus PC-9]], the British [[NDN Firecracker|NDN-1T Turbo-Firecracker]] and the [[AAC Wamira|Australian Aircraft Consortium]]'s (AAC) [[AAC Wamira|A.20 Wamira II]].<ref name = Fri87 />\n\nDuring 1984, Embraer dispatched the seventh EMB-312 airframe off the production line to Shorts, where it received numerous modifications in order to meet the AST-412 requirements.<ref name=Fri87/> During September 1984, this same aircraft was displayed at the [[Farnborough Airshow]]; by this point, it had been equipped with an uprated PT6A-25C2 engine and a ventral [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brake]], which reportedly enabled the Tucano to achieve the required stall speed of 60 kn.<ref name=Fri87/> However, tests undertaken at [[MOD Boscombe Down]] later on that year indicated the need to re-engine the aircraft in order to satisfy the RAF's requirement for time to height; accordingly, the [[Garrett TPE331]] was selected.<ref name=Fri87 />\n\nOn 21 March 1985, the Short Tucano proposal was declared the winner of the AST.412, receiving a contract worth \u00a3126 million for the provision of 130 aircraft, along with an option for a further 15;<ref name=Fri87/> this option was never taken up. The first flight of the prototype EMB-312G2, which was furnished with a four-bladed [[Hartzell Propeller|Hartzell]] propeller and the Garrett TPE331-10 engine, took place in Brazil on 14 February of the following year. Shortly afterwards, this aircraft was disassembled and [[airlift]]ed to Short's [[Belfast]] facility on 29 March 1986, where it was reassembled and returned to the skies just ten days later.<ref name=sturt87>{{harvp|Sturtivant|1987|pp=243\u2013244}}</ref> During June of that year, the TPE331-10 engine was replaced by the improved TPE331-12B, a major difference being the integration of an [[FADEC|Electronic Engine Controller]] (EEC) system.<ref name=Fri87/><ref name = sturt87 />\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Shorts Tucano, Newtownards Air Show, June 1991 (01).jpg|thumb|Short-operated prototype, 1991]]\n\nOn 30 December 1986, the first standard production model Tucano T.Mk 1 was flown; its official rollout took place on 20 January 1987.<ref>{{harvp|Fricker|1987|p=238}}</ref> On 10 March 1987, the second aircraft made its first flight, and, by April, a third Tucano had joined the test fleet for clearance and final testing, which was largely undertaken at MOD Boscombe Down.<ref>{{harvp|Sturtivant|1987|p=244}}</ref> The fourth aircraft to be built was the first delivered to the RAF on 16 June 1988 at the [[Central Flying School]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Aircraft-Upgrades/Shorts-S312-Tucano-United-Kingdom.html |title=Shorts S312 Tucano (United Kingdom) |date= 11 June  2012 |publisher=Jane's Information |accessdate= 19 October 2012}}</ref> Deliveries would continue to the RAF for another five years, the final aircraft arriving on 25 January 1993.<ref name=ukserials>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukserials.com/prodlists.php?type=1107 |title=Short Tucano |publisher=UK Serial Resource Centre |accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the sizable order for the RAF, multiple export customers emerged for the Shorts-produced Tucanos. The [[Kenyan Air Force]] ordered a total of 12 units while a further 16 Tucanos were exported to Kuwait. Those Tucanos delivered to the [[Kuwait Air Force]] were suitable furnished to be combat-capable, it was armed for the purposes of both weapons training and light attack duties; such aircraft are fitted with four [[hard point]]s, each capable of mounting various [[rocket pod]]s, [[cannon]]s, [[bomb]]s, and [[external fuel tank]]s.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%200397.html \"Kuwait orders Shorts Tucano trainers.\"] ''Flight International'', 18 February 1989. p. 3.</ref>\n\nDue to its Garrett engine, the Short Tucano is more responsive to thrust changes and is somewhat noisier than the original Tucano.<ref>Wagstaff, Patty.

Two [[Martin-Baker]] MB 8LC [[ejection seat]]s are used and the canopy was modified to meet the RAF's [[bird strike]] requirements.

It is a [[licensed production|licence-built]] version of the [[Brazil]]ian [[Embraer EMB-312 Tucano]].\n\nOn 14 February 1986, the prototype conducted its [[maiden flight]] in Brazil before being delivered to Shorts to be used as a pattern aircraft and modified to meet [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) requirements and used for trials and demonstrations. The first Short-assembled aircraft flew on 30 December 1986; deliveries to the RAF commenced during June 1988. The final example of the type was completed in 1995. Maintenance and support of the RAF's Tucano fleet was typically [[outsource]]d to several private companies.\n\nThe RAF was the Tucano's primary operator, although export sales have been achieved with the nations of [[Kenya]] and [[Kuwait]]. A handful have also been purchased and piloted by private individuals. The potential arming of RAF Tucanos to facilitate combat missions and be deployed overseas during [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] was at one point mooted. On 25 October 2019, the Tucano was withdrawn from RAF service. It has been replaced by the winner of the [[UK Military Flying Training System]] (UKMFTS) programme, under which civilian-registered [[Beechcraft T-6 Texan II|Beechcraft T-6C]]s have taken on its training duties.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Origins===\nDevelopment of the Short Tucano commenced in May 1984, following an agreement between [[Brazil]]ian aircraft manufacturer [[Embraer]] and [[Northern Ireland]] aviation firm [[Short Brothers]] to collaborate on a response to an outstanding [[United Kingdom|British]] requirement, which sought a replacement for the aging [[BAC Jet Provost]] basic trainer for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).<ref name = Fri87 /> For this purpose, the RAF had issued [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff Target 412]], defining the performance criteria it desire for a new high-performance [[turboprop]]-powered basic trainer. A [[short list]] was compiled of various aircraft that had been submitted in response; other than the Tucano, the types considered were the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Pilatus PC-9]], the British [[NDN Firecracker|NDN-1T Turbo-Firecracker]] and the [[AAC Wamira|Australian Aircraft Consortium]]'s (AAC) [[AAC Wamira|A.20 Wamira II]].<ref name = Fri87 />\n\nDuring 1984, Embraer dispatched the seventh EMB-312 airframe off the production line to Shorts, where it received numerous modifications in order to meet the AST-412 requirements.<ref name=Fri87/> During September 1984, this same aircraft was displayed at the [[Farnborough Airshow]]; by this point, it had been equipped with an uprated PT6A-25C2 engine and a ventral [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brake]], which reportedly enabled the Tucano to achieve the required stall speed of 60 kn.<ref name=Fri87/> However, tests undertaken at [[MOD Boscombe Down]] later on that year indicated the need to re-engine the aircraft in order to satisfy the RAF's requirement for time to height; accordingly, the [[Garrett TPE331]] was selected.<ref name=Fri87 />\n\nOn 21 March 1985, the Short Tucano proposal was declared the winner of the AST.412, receiving a contract worth \u00a3126 million for the provision of 130 aircraft, along with an option for a further 15;<ref name=Fri87/> this option was never taken up. The first flight of the prototype EMB-312G2, which was furnished with a four-bladed [[Hartzell Propeller|Hartzell]] propeller and the Garrett TPE331-10 engine, took place in Brazil on 14 February of the following year. Shortly afterwards, this aircraft was disassembled and [[airlift]]ed to Short's [[Belfast]] facility on 29 March 1986, where it was reassembled and returned to the skies just ten days later.<ref name=sturt87>{{harvp|Sturtivant|1987|pp=243\u2013244}}</ref> During June of that year, the TPE331-10 engine was replaced by the improved TPE331-12B, a major difference being the integration of an [[FADEC|Electronic Engine Controller]] (EEC) system.<ref name=Fri87/><ref name = sturt87 />\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Shorts Tucano, Newtownards Air Show, June 1991 (01).jpg|thumb|Short-operated prototype, 1991]]\n\nOn 30 December 1986, the first standard production model Tucano T.Mk 1 was flown; its official rollout took place on 20 January 1987.<ref>{{harvp|Fricker|1987|p=238}}</ref> On 10 March 1987, the second aircraft made its first flight, and, by April, a third Tucano had joined the test fleet for clearance and final testing, which was largely undertaken at MOD Boscombe Down.<ref>{{harvp|Sturtivant|1987|p=244}}</ref> The fourth aircraft to be built was the first delivered to the RAF on 16 June 1988 at the [[Central Flying School]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Aircraft-Upgrades/Shorts-S312-Tucano-United-Kingdom.html |title=Shorts S312 Tucano (United Kingdom) |date= 11 June  2012 |publisher=Jane's Information |accessdate= 19 October 2012}}</ref> Deliveries would continue to the RAF for another five years, the final aircraft arriving on 25 January 1993.<ref name=ukserials>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukserials.com/prodlists.php?type=1107 |title=Short Tucano |publisher=UK Serial Resource Centre |accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the sizable order for the RAF, multiple export customers emerged for the Shorts-produced Tucanos. The [[Kenyan Air Force]] ordered a total of 12 units while a further 16 Tucanos were exported to Kuwait. Those Tucanos delivered to the [[Kuwait Air Force]] were suitable furnished to be combat-capable, it was armed for the purposes of both weapons training and light attack duties; such aircraft are fitted with four [[hard point]]s, each capable of mounting various [[rocket pod]]s, [[cannon]]s, [[bomb]]s, and [[external fuel tank]]s.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%200397.html \"Kuwait orders Shorts Tucano trainers.\"] ''Flight International'', 18 February 1989. p. 3.</ref>\n\nDue to its Garrett engine, the Short Tucano is more responsive to thrust changes and is somewhat noisier than the original Tucano.<ref>Wagstaff, Patty.

Two [[Martin-Baker]] MB 8LC [[ejection seat]]s are used and the canopy was modified to meet the RAF's [[bird strike]] requirements.

The film stars the voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], Candace Hutson, [[Judith Barsi]] and [[Will Ryan]] with narration provided by [[Pat Hingle]].\n\nProduced by the American companies [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Lucasfilm]], and the American-Irish [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Ltd.]], it features [[dinosaur]]s living in the prehistoric times. The plot concerns a young \"Longneck\" (''[[Apatosaurus]]'') named Littlefoot, who is orphaned<ref name=\"Lenburg2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |edition=Third|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> when his mother is killed by a vicious carnivore. Littlefoot flees [[famine]] and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera the \"Threehorn\" (''[[Triceratops]]''), Ducky the \"Bigmouth\" (''[[Saurolophus]]''), Petrie the \"Flyer\" (''[[Pteranodon]]''), and Spike the \"Spiketail\" (''[[Stegosaurus]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time |title=The Land Before Time |publisher=Universal Pictures Entertainment |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot's mother and forced to deal with a \"Sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''). This is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which [[Dom DeLuise]] did not participate (instead, he starred in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' that same year), and the only film in ''The Land Before Time'' series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide.\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]] on November 18, 1988, the first film spawned [[The Land Before Time (franchise)|a franchise]] with thirteen [[direct-to-video]] sequels and [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|a television series]] and merchandise, none of which had Bluth, Spielberg or Lucas' involvement.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING! Per WP:FILMPLOT, feature film plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words only! -->\nDuring the [[Mesozoic|age of the dinosaurs]], a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an [[oasis]] known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished \"longneck\" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a \"three-horn\", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: \"three-horns\", \"spike-tails\", \"swimmers\", and \"flyers\". That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"[[Triadobatrachus|hopper]]\", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"[[Tyrannosaurus|Sharptooth]]\" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old \"[[Scolosaurus|clubtail]]\" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"[[volcano|Mountains that Burn]]\".\n\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\" named Ducky and a \"flyer\" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching \"spiketail\", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\n\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a [[tar pit]], and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'') who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. He, along with Ducky, Petrie and Spike, pose as a tar monster, scaring Cera out of her wits. When she realizes who it really is, she storms off in a huff. It is not long, however, until she gives in to her guilt, being that her stubbornness put others in danger for her own selfish desires, and the imagined shame she would receive from her father. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\n\nThe plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Land Before Time characters}}\n* [[Gabriel Damon]] as Littlefoot\n* Candace Hutson as Cera\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Ducky\n* [[Will Ryan]] as Petrie\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Littlefoot's mother\n* [[Burke Byrnes]] as Cera's father\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Littlefoot's grandfather\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Narrator and Rooter\n\n== Production ==\nDuring production of ''[[An American Tail]]'', talk began of the next feature with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to ''[[Bambi]]'', but with only dinosaurs. George Lucas was also brought in on the project. An early working title for the film was ''The Land Before Time Began''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |location= |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=354 }}</ref> Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.<ref name=\"AFDB\">{{cite book |title= The Animated Films of Don Bluth |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html |author=Cawley, Jon |date=October 1991 |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\nThroughout production, ''The Land Before Time'' underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the movie would appear too dark and intense for young children. Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, \"It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don't want that.\" About 10 minutes of footage, comprising a total of 19 fully animated scenes, were cut from the final film, to attain a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]] instead of a PG rating. Much of the cut footage consisted of the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attack sequence and sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. Examples can be seen in the storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of Sharptooth's snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/04/don-bluth-storyboards-2-land-before.html Part 1 \u2013 Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/06/part-2-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref><ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/10/part-3-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations.<ref name=\"AFDB\" />\n\n=== Music and soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 21, 1988<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5Q |title=James Horner, Diana Ross \u2013 The Land Before Time |accessdate=October 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 57:49\n| label      = [[MCA Records]] (1988)<br />[[Geffen Records]] (2013)\n| producer   = [[James Horner]]\n| chronology = Don Bluth Music of Films\n| prev_title = [[An American Tail]]\n| prev_year  = 1986\n| next_title = [[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]\n| next_year  = 1989\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[If We Hold on Together]]\n | single1date = January 21, 1989\n}}\n}}\nThe music for ''The Land Before Time'' was composed by [[James Horner]], who had previously provided the soundtrack for ''An American Tail'', and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]].

The film stars the voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], Candace Hutson, [[Judith Barsi]] and [[Will Ryan]] with narration provided by [[Pat Hingle]].\n\nProduced by the American companies [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Lucasfilm]], and the American-Irish [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Ltd.]], it features [[dinosaur]]s living in the prehistoric times. The plot concerns a young \"Longneck\" (''[[Apatosaurus]]'') named Littlefoot, who is orphaned<ref name=\"Lenburg2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |edition=Third|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> when his mother is killed by a vicious carnivore. Littlefoot flees [[famine]] and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera the \"Threehorn\" (''[[Triceratops]]''), Ducky the \"Bigmouth\" (''[[Saurolophus]]''), Petrie the \"Flyer\" (''[[Pteranodon]]''), and Spike the \"Spiketail\" (''[[Stegosaurus]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time |title=The Land Before Time |publisher=Universal Pictures Entertainment |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot's mother and forced to deal with a \"Sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''). This is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which [[Dom DeLuise]] did not participate (instead, he starred in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' that same year), and the only film in ''The Land Before Time'' series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide.\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]] on November 18, 1988, the first film spawned [[The Land Before Time (franchise)|a franchise]] with thirteen [[direct-to-video]] sequels and [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|a television series]] and merchandise, none of which had Bluth, Spielberg or Lucas' involvement.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING! Per WP:FILMPLOT, feature film plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words only! -->\nDuring the [[Mesozoic|age of the dinosaurs]], a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an [[oasis]] known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished \"longneck\" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a \"three-horn\", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: \"three-horns\", \"spike-tails\", \"swimmers\", and \"flyers\". That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"[[Triadobatrachus|hopper]]\", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"[[Tyrannosaurus|Sharptooth]]\" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old \"[[Scolosaurus|clubtail]]\" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"[[volcano|Mountains that Burn]]\".\n\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\" named Ducky and a \"flyer\" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching \"spiketail\", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\n\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a [[tar pit]], and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'') who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. He, along with Ducky, Petrie and Spike, pose as a tar monster, scaring Cera out of her wits. When she realizes who it really is, she storms off in a huff. It is not long, however, until she gives in to her guilt, being that her stubbornness put others in danger for her own selfish desires, and the imagined shame she would receive from her father. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\n\nThe plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Land Before Time characters}}\n* [[Gabriel Damon]] as Littlefoot\n* Candace Hutson as Cera\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Ducky\n* [[Will Ryan]] as Petrie\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Littlefoot's mother\n* [[Burke Byrnes]] as Cera's father\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Littlefoot's grandfather\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Narrator and Rooter\n\n== Production ==\nDuring production of ''[[An American Tail]]'', talk began of the next feature with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to ''[[Bambi]]'', but with only dinosaurs. George Lucas was also brought in on the project. An early working title for the film was ''The Land Before Time Began''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |location= |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=354 }}</ref> Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.<ref name=\"AFDB\">{{cite book |title= The Animated Films of Don Bluth |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html |author=Cawley, Jon |date=October 1991 |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\nThroughout production, ''The Land Before Time'' underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the movie would appear too dark and intense for young children. Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, \"It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don't want that.\" About 10 minutes of footage, comprising a total of 19 fully animated scenes, were cut from the final film, to attain a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]] instead of a PG rating. Much of the cut footage consisted of the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attack sequence and sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. Examples can be seen in the storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of Sharptooth's snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/04/don-bluth-storyboards-2-land-before.html Part 1 \u2013 Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/06/part-2-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref><ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/10/part-3-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations.<ref name=\"AFDB\" />\n\n=== Music and soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 21, 1988<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5Q |title=James Horner, Diana Ross \u2013 The Land Before Time |accessdate=October 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 57:49\n| label      = [[MCA Records]] (1988)<br />[[Geffen Records]] (2013)\n| producer   = [[James Horner]]\n| chronology = Don Bluth Music of Films\n| prev_title = [[An American Tail]]\n| prev_year  = 1986\n| next_title = [[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]\n| next_year  = 1989\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[If We Hold on Together]]\n | single1date = January 21, 1989\n}}\n}}\nThe music for ''The Land Before Time'' was composed by [[James Horner]], who had previously provided the soundtrack for ''An American Tail'', and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]].

Born and raised in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], she rose to fame in late 2002 upon winning a place in [[Girls Aloud]], a [[girl group]] created through [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Popstars: The Rivals]]''. While still in the group, she began a solo career in April 2009, and between then and 2014, she released four studio albums \u2013 ''[[3 Words]]'' (2009), ''[[Messy Little Raindrops]]'' (2010), ''[[A Million Lights]]'' (2012) and ''[[Only Human (Cheryl album)|Only Human]]'' (2014). Collectively, the albums included ten [[Cheryl discography#As lead artist|singles]], five of which \u2013 \"[[Fight for This Love]], \"[[Promise This]]\", \"[[Call My Name (Cheryl Cole song)|Call My Name]]\", \"[[Crazy Stupid Love (song)|Crazy Stupid Love]]\" and \"[[I Don't Care (Cheryl Cole song)|I Don't Care]]\" \u2013 reached the [[Lists of UK Singles Chart number ones|top position]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Cheryl was the first British female solo artist to have five number-one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until [[Jess Glynne]] overtook her in 2018.\n\nCheryl became a judge on the [[The X Factor (UK TV series)|UK version]] of ''[[The X Factor]]'' in 2008.

With the opportunity to enact proposals that had circulated since the mid-1980s, the city council voted unanimously to demolish 4,500 units of traditional public housing. In just over a decade\u2014from 1996 to 2007\u2014the city managed to close 85% of the city's public housing, adopting a system of \"mixed-income\" projects and vouchers instead.

In 2005, around 1,500,000 people from Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were forced to leave their homes die to Hurricane Katrina. Around 40% of evacuees, mostly people from Louisiana, were not able to return home. 25% of evacuees relocated within 10-miles of their previous county. 25% of evacuees relocated at least 450-miles away. 10& of evacuees relocated  at least 830-miles away.<ref name=\"when you cant go home\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2015/08/18/119511/when-you-cant-go-home/|title=When You Can\u2019t Go Home|last=Baussan|first=Danielle|website=Center for American Progress|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> \"Returning home can be an important step for the health and economic stability of low-income, climate-displaced families.

By July 2015, the population was back up to 386,617\u201480% of what it was in 2000. However, not all those who moved to the city were returning residents.<ref name=\"datacenterresearch.org\"/> After Hurricane Katrina the privatization push gained momentum. With the opportunity to enact proposals that had circulated since the mid-1980s, the city council voted unanimously to demolish 4,500 units of traditional public housing. In just over a decade\u2014from 1996 to 2007\u2014the city managed to close 85% of the city's public housing, adopting a system of \"mixed-income\" projects and vouchers instead. While liberals touted it as \"deconcentration,\" the removal project effectively (and efficiently) displaced low-income residents from areas ripe for profit-making. As a result, 16,000 families remain on the waitlist for subsidized housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/katrina-new-orleans-arne-duncan-charters/|title=Gentrification\u2019s Ground Zero|publisher=}}</ref><ref>Katrina and Rita IDPs are not of concern to, and therefore not counted by, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] ({{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/statistics/STATISTICS/4486ceb12.pdf|title=2005 Global Refugee Trends }}, UNHCR, Table 14, p. 94).

Being larger than preceding commercial flying boats, as well as the novel use of jet engines for such a vehicle, Saunders-Roe promoted the Duchess as representing the next generation of flying boats to various civilian [[airline]]s. Durng the early 1950s, it was also promoted for military applications such as [[aerial reconnaissance]] and military transport duties, as had been the Princess. An even larger flying boat, the [[Saunders-Roe Queen]], was also proposed around the same time. Unlike the Princess, however, no examples of the Duchess never flew; attempts to garner interest in the concept never resulted in any orders being placed for the type, thus it never left the drawing board.\n\n==Development==\nPrior to the [[World War II|Second World War]], British airline [[Imperial Airways]] had successfully used large long-range passenger [[flying boat]]s, aircraft that could land and take off from the water, such as the [[Short Empire]] and [[Short S.26]] to build up a network of long distance routes.<ref name = \"Kaplan 196\">Kaplan 2005, p. 196.</ref> These flying boats had not only pioneered new aerial routes across the [[British Empire]] which had previously not been served at all, passengers were transported within an unprecedented level of comfort, being provided with luxurious first class accommodation, including a [[promenade]], sizable [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], separate bathrooms for men and women, and individual cabins for passengers. However, operations of these flying boats had been disrupted by wartime, during which Imperial Airways had also merged with [[British Airways Ltd]] to form [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) in 1940.<ref name = \"Kaplan 196 197\">Kaplan 2005, pp. 196\u2013197.</ref> Even prior to the war's end, the British [[Air Ministry]] was enthusiastic on the prospects for reviving the shuttered flying boat routes.<ref name = \"Kaplan 200\">Kaplan 2005, p. 200.</ref>\n\nDuring this same era, the British aircraft manufacturer [[Saunders-Roe]] had established itself as a prominent specialist in the field of flying boats in both civil and military contexts. The company foresaw a need of increasingly larger flying boats in the [[postwar]] era. Accordingly, the firm opted to design such an aircraft, which it named the [[Saunders-Roe Princess|Princess]], a large [[turboprop]]-powered flying boat.<ref name = \"airspace princess\"/> While several prototypes were constructed during the early 1950s, no buyers would emerge for the Princess as [[airline]]s opted to pursue the increasingly capable ground-based airliners instead, such as the newly-developed [[de Havilland Comet]], the world's first [[jet propulsion|jet-propelled]] passenger aircraft.

Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick & Moody, 2003).\n\nAlmost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as \"senescence\".

Additionally, the advent of life-sustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint, have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition.\n\nOne of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref> Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life.\n\nIt is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.<ref>{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. This type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death (DCDD). Proponents of the DCDD believe that this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=2018|title=Conceptual Issues in DCDD Donor Death Determination|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=48|issue=S4|pages=S26\u2013S28|doi=10.1002/hast.948|pmid=30584853|issn=1552-146X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent, it does not mean the situation is not irreversible, because if CPR was applied, the person could be revived.<ref name=\":4\"/> Thus, the arguments for and against the DCDD boil down to a matter of defining the actual words \"permanent\" and \"irreversible,\" which further complicates the challenge of defining death. Furthermore, events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.\n\nThe category of \"brain death\" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: \"By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant \"brain-dead\" women).\"<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616\u2013620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nWhile \"brain death\" is viewed as problematic by some scholars, there are certainly proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death. The reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Magnus|first=David C.|last2=Wilfond|first2=Benjamin S.|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur L.|date=2014-03-06|title=Accepting Brain Death|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=10|pages=891\u2013894|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1400930|issn=0028-4793|pmid=24499177}}</ref> Also, the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings. The distinction should be made that \"brain death\" cannot be equated with one who is in a vegetative state or coma, in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThose people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&nbsp;\u2013 irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&nbsp;\u2013 has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nEven by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.\n\nIn the past, adoption of this whole-brain definition was a conclusion of the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1980.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Ariane|last2=Cahn-Fuller|first2=Katherine|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur|date=March 2017|title=Shouldn't Dead Be Dead?: The Search for a Uniform Definition of Death|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=112\u2013128|doi=10.1177/1073110517703105|pmid=28661278|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> They concluded that this approach to defining death sufficed in reaching a uniform definition nationwide. A multitude of reasons were presented to support this definition including: uniformity of standards in law for establishing death; consumption of a family's fiscal resources for artificial life support; and legal establishment for equating brain death with death in order to proceed with organ donation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sarbey|first=Ben|date=2016-12-01|title=Definitions of death: brain death and what matters in a person|journal=Journal of Law and the Biosciences|volume=3|issue=3|pages=743\u2013752|doi=10.1093/jlb/lsw054|pmid=28852554|pmc=5570697}}</ref>\n\nAside from the issue of support of or dispute against brain death, there is another inherent problem in this categorical definition: the variability of its application in medical practice. In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), established a set of criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death. At that time, three clinical features had to be satisfied in order to determine \u201cirreversible cessation\u201d of the total brain including: coma with clear etiology, cessation of breathing, and lack of brainstem reflexes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=March 2013|title=Controversies in defining and determining death in critical care|journal=Nature Reviews Neurology|volume=9|issue=3|pages=164\u2013173|doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2013.12|pmid=23419370|issn=1759-4766}}</ref> This set of criteria was then updated again most recently in 2010, but substantial discrepancies still remain across hospitals and medical specialties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe problem of defining death is especially imperative as it pertains to the [[dead donor rule]], which could be understood as one of the following interpretations of the rule: there must be an official declaration of death in a person before starting organ procurement or that organ procurement cannot result in death of the donor.<ref name=\":4\"/> A great deal of controversy has surrounded the definition of death and the dead donor rule. Advocates of the rule believe the rule is legitimate in protecting organ donors while also countering against any moral or legal objection to organ procurement.

From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}</ref> and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death.

It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].\n\nAutopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.\n\nA necropsy, which is not always a medical procedure, was a term previously used to describe an unregulated postmortem examination .

Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.\n\nA United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.\n\nResearchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as \"biomedical [[gerontologist]]s\".

The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top.

Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cart\u00f3rio.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204\u2013220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}</ref>\n\nTalking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures.

[[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.\n\n[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be fully decomposed. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.\n\n=== Natural selection ===\n{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}\n\nContemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.\n\n=== Extinction ===\n{{Main|Extinction}}\n[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies  |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W.

The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappear\" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] \u2013 and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.\n\n=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===\n{{Main|Evolution of ageing}}\n\nInquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.\n\nOrganisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are \"immortal\" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident.

Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|\"deathless\"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment. Therefore, death helps remind oneself that one should not take life for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.<ref name=\"Blum 2004\">{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}</ref>\n\nDeath is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|dependent origination]].<ref name=\"Blum 2004\" />\n\n=== Christianity ===\n{{See also|Soul in the Bible|Second death|Resurrection of the dead#Christianity}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{See also|Islamic view of death}}\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]\n{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}\nDeath is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.

Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick & Moody, 2003).\n\nAlmost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as \"senescence\".

Additionally, the advent of life-sustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint, have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition.\n\nOne of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref> Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life.\n\nIt is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.<ref>{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation.

Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. This type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death (DCDD). Proponents of the DCDD believe that this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=2018|title=Conceptual Issues in DCDD Donor Death Determination|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=48|issue=S4|pages=S26\u2013S28|doi=10.1002/hast.948|pmid=30584853|issn=1552-146X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent, it does not mean the situation is not irreversible, because if CPR was applied, the person could be revived.<ref name=\":4\"/> Thus, the arguments for and against the DCDD boil down to a matter of defining the actual words \"permanent\" and \"irreversible,\" which further complicates the challenge of defining death. Furthermore, events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.\n\nThe category of \"brain death\" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: \"By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant \"brain-dead\" women).\"<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616\u2013620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nWhile \"brain death\" is viewed as problematic by some scholars, there are certainly proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death. The reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Magnus|first=David C.|last2=Wilfond|first2=Benjamin S.|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur L.|date=2014-03-06|title=Accepting Brain Death|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=10|pages=891\u2013894|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1400930|issn=0028-4793|pmid=24499177}}</ref> Also, the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings. The distinction should be made that \"brain death\" cannot be equated with one who is in a vegetative state or coma, in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThose people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&nbsp;\u2013 irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&nbsp;\u2013 has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].\n\nEven by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.\n\nIn the past, adoption of this whole-brain definition was a conclusion of the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1980.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Ariane|last2=Cahn-Fuller|first2=Katherine|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur|date=March 2017|title=Shouldn't Dead Be Dead?: The Search for a Uniform Definition of Death|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=112\u2013128|doi=10.1177/1073110517703105|pmid=28661278|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> They concluded that this approach to defining death sufficed in reaching a uniform definition nationwide. A multitude of reasons were presented to support this definition including: uniformity of standards in law for establishing death; consumption of a family's fiscal resources for artificial life support; and legal establishment for equating brain death with death in order to proceed with organ donation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sarbey|first=Ben|date=2016-12-01|title=Definitions of death: brain death and what matters in a person|journal=Journal of Law and the Biosciences|volume=3|issue=3|pages=743\u2013752|doi=10.1093/jlb/lsw054|pmid=28852554|pmc=5570697}}</ref>\n\nAside from the issue of support of or dispute against brain death, there is another inherent problem in this categorical definition: the variability of its application in medical practice. In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), established a set of criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death. At that time, three clinical features had to be satisfied in order to determine \u201cirreversible cessation\u201d of the total brain including: coma with clear etiology, cessation of breathing, and lack of brainstem reflexes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=March 2013|title=Controversies in defining and determining death in critical care|journal=Nature Reviews Neurology|volume=9|issue=3|pages=164\u2013173|doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2013.12|pmid=23419370|issn=1759-4766}}</ref> This set of criteria was then updated again most recently in 2010, but substantial discrepancies still remain across hospitals and medical specialties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe problem of defining death is especially imperative as it pertains to the [[dead donor rule]], which could be understood as one of the following interpretations of the rule: there must be an official declaration of death in a person before starting organ procurement or that organ procurement cannot result in death of the donor.<ref name=\":4\"/> A great deal of controversy has surrounded the definition of death and the dead donor rule. Advocates of the rule believe the rule is legitimate in protecting organ donors while also countering against any moral or legal objection to organ procurement.

It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].\n\nAutopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.\n\nA necropsy, which is not always a medical procedure, was a term previously used to describe an unregulated postmortem examination .

Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.\n\nA United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.\n\nResearchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as \"biomedical [[gerontologist]]s\".

The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top.

Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cart\u00f3rio.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204\u2013220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}</ref>\n\nTalking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures.

[[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.\n\n[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be fully decomposed. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.\n\n=== Natural selection ===\n{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}\n\nContemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.\n\n=== Extinction ===\n{{Main|Extinction}}\n[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies  |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W.

The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappear\" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] \u2013 and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.\n\n=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===\n{{Main|Evolution of ageing}}\n\nInquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.\n\nOrganisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are \"immortal\" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident.

Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|\"deathless\"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment. Therefore, death helps remind oneself that one should not take life for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.<ref name=\"Blum 2004\">{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}</ref>\n\nDeath is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|dependent origination]].<ref name=\"Blum 2004\" />\n\n=== Christianity ===\n{{See also|Soul in the Bible|Second death|Resurrection of the dead#Christianity}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{See also|Islamic view of death}}\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]\n{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}\nDeath is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.
