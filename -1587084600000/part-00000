He started learning [[karate]] of Uomoto-ry\u016b (\u9b5a\u672c\u6d41) as a child. His parents divorced in 1997 and he lived with his mother, sisters and grandmother.\n\n==Kickboxing career==\nKyotaro moved to [[Tokyo]] and joined Dragon Dojo established by Kensaku Maeda. He debuted on May 17, 2006 against Junichi Hanada.\n\nKyotaro entered the world of K-1 when he fought and won the [[K-1 Tryout 2007 Survival]] tournament in Tokyo by defeating Tatsunori Momose in the semi-final and Takumi Sato in the final, all by decision. This tournament was designed to showcase new talent. He then fought Kyoung Suk Kim during the opening fights at [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2007 in Seoul Final 16]] defeating Kim by 2nd Round Knockout. \n\nHe further proved himself as a top K-1 contender by defeating the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 in Las Vegas II]] and the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2007 in Hawaii]] tournament champion [[Mighty Mo (kickboxer)|Mighty Mo]] at [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Yokohama]]. Kyotaro was then invited to fight in the [[K-1 World GP 2008 in Fukuoka]] in which he became the runner up losing to Brazilian Karateka [[Ewerton Teixeira]].\n\nOn March 28, 2009, Kyotaro won the K-1 Heavyweight (-100&nbsp;kg) Title tournament by knocking out [[Melvin Manhoef]] in semifinals and beating [[Gokhan Saki]] in finals by extra round majority decision.

Kyotaro knocked Aerts down twice at the end of the 1st Round and then knocked him out with his right hook in the 2nd Round.\n\nAt the K-1 Final 16 Kyotaro defeated another legend in [[Jerome Le Banner]]. Kyotaro withstood the Frenchman's early power to give him a severe beating in the 3rd round to earn a draw.  Le Banner was angry at the decision and walked out of the ring, giving Kyotaro the win by DQ.\n\nHis next fight was at the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final]] against 4-time defending champion [[Semmy Schilt]]. He was unable to faze his taller opponent, losing by unanimous decision.\n\nHe then chose to fight the DREAM (MMA) Light-heavyweight champion [[Gegard Mousasi]]. He was knocked down in the second round and again lost by unanimous decision.\n\nIn October 2011, Kyotaro relinquished the K-1 Heavyweight title in order to pursue a career in [[professional boxing]].<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=958:kyotaro-relinquishes-k-1-heavyweight-championship-to-move-into-boxing&catid=36:k-1 Kyotaro Relinquishes K-1 Heavyweight Championship to Move Into Boxing]</ref>\n\n==Boxing career==\nKyotaro debuted as a pro boxer on December 31, 2011 when he took a unanimous decision win over Michael O'Donnell in Osaka, Japan.

He started learning [[karate]] of Uomoto-ry\u016b (\u9b5a\u672c\u6d41) as a child. His parents divorced in 1997 and he lived with his mother, sisters and grandmother.\n\n==Kickboxing career==\nKyotaro moved to [[Tokyo]] and joined Dragon Dojo established by Kensaku Maeda. He debuted on May 17, 2006 against Junichi Hanada.\n\nKyotaro entered the world of K-1 when he fought and won the [[K-1 Tryout 2007 Survival]] tournament in Tokyo by defeating Tatsunori Momose in the semi-final and Takumi Sato in the final, all by decision. This tournament was designed to showcase new talent. He then fought Kyoung Suk Kim during the opening fights at [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2007 in Seoul Final 16]] defeating Kim by 2nd Round Knockout. He further proved himself as a top K-1 contender by defeating the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2004 in Las Vegas II]] and the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2007 in Hawaii]] tournament champion [[Mighty Mo (kickboxer)|Mighty Mo]] at [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Yokohama]]. Kyotaro was then invited to fight in the [[K-1 World GP 2008 in Fukuoka]] in which he became the runner up losing to Brazilian Karateka [[Ewerton Teixeira]].\n\nOn March 28, 2009, Kyotaro won the K-1 Heavyweight (-100&nbsp;kg) Title tournament by knocking out [[Melvin Manhoef]] in semifinals and beating [[Gokhan Saki]] in finals by extra round majority decision. Kyotaro became the second fighter after [[Badr Hari]] to win the title in K-1 Light Heavyweight division.<ref name=\"Maeda Takes K-1 Heavyweight Belt; Bonjasky Beats Overeem\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.k-1.co.jp/k-1gp/dtop.htm\n |title       = Maeda Takes K-1 Heavyweight Belt; Bonjasky Beats Overeem\n |accessdate  = 2009-03-28\n |publisher   = K-1 Grand Prix Website\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011004832/http://www.k-1.co.jp/k-1gp/dtop.htm\n |archivedate = 2007-10-11\n}}</ref>\n\nOn December 5, 2009, he faced [[Tyrone Spong]] at the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 Final]] and lost by unanimous decision.\n\nKyotaro defended his title against 3 time [[List of K-1 champions#K-1 World Grand Prix Champions|K-1 Grand Prix Champion]] [[Peter Aerts]] at [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Yokohama]]. Kyotaro knocked Aerts down twice at the end of the 1st Round and then knocked him out with his right hook in the 2nd Round.\n\nAt the K-1 Final 16 Kyotaro defeated another legend in [[Jerome Le Banner]]. Kyotaro withstood the Frenchman's early power to give him a severe beating in the 3rd round to earn a draw.  Le Banner was angry at the decision and walked out of the ring, giving Kyotaro the win by DQ.\n\nHis next fight was at the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final]] against 4-time defending champion [[Semmy Schilt]]. He was unable to faze his taller opponent, losing by unanimous decision.\n\nHe then chose to fight the DREAM (MMA) Light-heavyweight champion [[Gegard Mousasi]]. He was knocked down in the second round and again lost by unanimous decision.\n\nIn October 2011, Kyotaro relinquished the K-1 Heavyweight title in order to pursue a career in [[professional boxing]].<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=958:kyotaro-relinquishes-k-1-heavyweight-championship-to-move-into-boxing&catid=36:k-1 Kyotaro Relinquishes K-1 Heavyweight Championship to Move Into Boxing]</ref>\n\n==Boxing career==\nKyotaro debuted as a pro boxer on December 31, 2011 when he took a unanimous decision win over Michael O'Donnell in Osaka, Japan.

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize

or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/>

care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |''APOE'' gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref

fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a shorter survival time after diagnosis than in AD. The difference in survival between AD and DLB could be because DLB is harder to diagnose, and may be diagnosed later in the course of the disease.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/> Falls\u2014caused by many factors including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and frailness\u2014increase [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name= Taylor2020/> [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphagia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most common form of neurodegnerative dementia after AD as of 2020.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Walker2015/> DLB itself is one of the three most common types of dementia, along with AD and vascular dementia.<ref name=NINDS2020Book>{{cite web|title=Lewy body dementia: Hope through research |url= https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Hope-Through-Research/Lewy-Body-Dementia-Hope-Through-Research |website= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |publisher = US National Institutes of Health |accessdate= March 18, 2020 |date= January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=Kosakav/>{{efn|name=CommonDem|Kosaka (2017) writes: \"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is now well known to be the second most frequent dementia following Alzheimer disease (AD).

Therapies under study as of 2019 aim to reduce brain levels of alpha-synuclein (with the pharmaceuticals [[ambroxol]], [[NPT200-11]], and [[E2027]]) or to use immunotherapy to reduce widespread neuroinflammation resulting from alpha-synuclein deposits.<ref name= Hershey2019/><ref name=Velayudhan2017/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | veditors = [[Kenji Kosaka (psychiatrist)|Kosaka K]] | title = Dementia with Lewy bodies: clinical and biological aspects | edition= 1st | year = 2017  | publisher = Springer | location = Japan  | doi = 10.1007/978-4-431-55948-1 | isbn = 978-4-431-55948-1 }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=32em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite journal | vauthors= Adams BD |title= Lewy Body Dementia in the Emergency Department |date= January 16, 2013 |journal= Postgraduate Medical Journal | url= http://pmj.bmj.com/content/lewy-body-dementia-emergency-department |accessdate= April 18, 2018 }}\n* {{cite video |url= https://www.alzforum.org/webinars/updated-diagnostic-criteria-and-management-lewy-body-dementia |title= Updated diagnostic criteria and management of Lewy body dementia |publisher= ALZForum co-hosted with [[Lewy Body Dementia Association]] |author= McKeith I|date= October 10, 2017 |accessdate= April 8, 2018 |type=Video}}\n*{{cite web | url= https://www.lbda.org/sites/default/files/emergency_room_treatment_of_psychosis.pdf |title= Emergency room treatment of psychosis | publisher =Lewy Body Dementia Association | accessdate= 27 April 2018}}\n\n{{Medical resources\n | DiseasesDB     = 3800\n | ICD10          = {{ICD10|G|31|8|g|30}}\n | ICD9           = {{ICD9|331.82}}\n | ICDO           =\n | OMIM           = 127750\n | MedlinePlus    =\n | eMedicineSubj  = neuro\n | eMedicineTopic = 91\n | MeshID         = D020961\n}}\n\n{{CNS diseases of the nervous system|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dementia with Lewy bodies}}\n[[Category:Aging-associated diseases]]\n[[Category:Ailments of unknown cause]]\n[[Category:Corticobasal syndrome]]\n[[Category:Geriatrics]]\n[[Category:Lewy body dementia]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric diagnosis]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:RTTNEURO]]\n", "name_user": "SandyGeorgia", "label": "safe", "comment": "eagle-eye typo spotter", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia_with_Lewy_bodies"}
