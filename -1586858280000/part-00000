Borlini, ''Corruption: Economic Analysis and International Law'' (2014), p. 297.</ref>\n\nModern criminal codes in the [[United States]] usually make distinct four degrees of culpability.\n\nLegal definitions of culpability are:\n#A person acts purposely (criminally) with respect to a material element of an offense when:\n##if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result; and\n##if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist.\n#A person acts [[knowingly]] with respect to a material element of an offense when:\n##if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and\n##if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\n#A person acts [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]] with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and intent of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a [[reasonable person]] would observe in the actor's situation.\n#A person acts [[negligence|negligently]] with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.\n\n(The above has been quoted [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] from the [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/18/00.003.002.000..HTM Pennsylvania Crimes Code]. That in turn derives from the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, which is the basis for large portions of the criminal codes in most states. The only difference is that the MPC uses \"purposely\" instead of \"intentionally\".)\n\nIn short:\n* A person  causes a result purposely if the result is his/her goal in doing the action that causes it,\n* A person causes a result knowingly if he/she knows that the result is virtually certain to occur from the action he/she undertakes,\n* A person causes a result recklessly if he/she is aware of and disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk of the result occurring from the action, and\n* A person causes a result negligently if there is a substantial and unjustifiable risk he/she is unaware of but should be aware of.\n\nThe first two types of culpability are each a subset of the following. Thus if someone acts purposely, they also act knowingly. If someone acts knowingly, they also act recklessly.\n\nThe definitions of specific crimes refer to these degrees to establish the [[mens rea]] (mental state) necessary for a person to be guilty of a crime. The stricter the culpability requirements, the harder it is for the prosecution to prove its case.\n\nFor instance, the definition of first degree [[murder]] (again in PA) is \"A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing.\" Thus to be guilty of murder in the first degree, one must have an explicit goal in one's mind to cause the death of another. On the other hand, [[reckless endangerment]] has a much broader requirement: \"A person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree if he recklessly engages in conduct which places or may place another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\" Thus to be guilty of this one only needs to be aware of a substantial risk he is putting others in danger of; it does not have to be one's explicit goal to put people in risk. (But, if one's goal ''is'' to put others in substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, this is, of course, sufficient.)\n\nThere is one more type of culpability, and that is ''strict liability''. In [[strict liability]] crimes, the actor is responsible no matter what his mental state; if the result occurs, the actor is liable. An example is the [[felony murder]] rule: if the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that one commits a qualifying felony (see the article) during which death results, one is held strictly liable for murder and the prosecution does not have to prove any of the normal culpability requirements for murder.\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|culpability|culpable}}\n* [[Blame]]\n* [[Guilt (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Scapegoating]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Social ethics]]\n[[Category:Criminal law legal terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Culpable}}\n{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}\n'''Culpability''', or being '''culpable''', is a measure of the degree to which an agent, such as a person, can be held [[Moral responsibility|morally]] or [[law|legally]] responsible for action and inaction.

Her career of travelling and writing about her travels has spanned 40 years.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nRobyn Davidson was born at Stanley Park, a cattle station in [[Miles, Queensland]], the second of two girls. Her mother died by suicide when Davidson was 11, and she was largely raised by her father's unmarried sister, Gillian. She went to a girls' boarding school in [[Brisbane]].<ref name=\"tracks\">{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Robyn|title=Tracks|date=30 May 1995|publisher=Vintage|isbn=0-679-76287-6|url=https://archive.org/details/trackswomanssolo00davi}}</ref> She received a music scholarship but did not take it up. In Brisbane, Davidson shared a house with biologists and studied zoology. In 1968, aged 18, she went to Sydney and later lived a bohemian life in a [[Sydney Push]] household at [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], while working as a card-dealer at an illegal gambling house.<ref>[[Anna Krien|Krien, Anna]].

For two years she trained camels and learned how to survive in the harsh desert. She was peripherally involved in the [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia|Aboriginal Land Rights]] movement.\n\nFor some years in the 1980s she was in a relationship with [[Salman Rushdie]], to whom she was introduced by their mutual friend [[Bruce Chatwin]].<ref>Bruce Chatwin, letter to Ninette Dutton, 1 November 1984, in ''Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin'', ed.

Having met the photographer [[Rick Smolan]] in Alice Springs, she insisted that he be the photographer for the journey. Smolan, with whom she had an \"on-again off-again\" romantic relationship during the trip, drove out to meet her three times during the nine-month journey. \n\nThe ''National Geographic'' article was published in 1978<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Robyn|date=May 1978|title=Tracks|journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|url= <!-- |accessdate= 12 November 2007 }}</ref> and attracted so much interest that Davidson decided to write a book about the experience.

He denies existed norms and creates his own new rules. People in Korean society, where is very authoritative, get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo because he says what they want to say on behalf of them. Pengsoo always says \"right thing\". Sometimes he says so straight to his boss and even he calls just his boss's name. This could not be imagined in Korean society. Probably, It seems to people get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo. He was chosen as the person of the year (even he is not a person). Also, there is a fun situation in Korea. People who are big fans of Pengsoo promised that \"Pengsoo is Pengsoo.\" That means Pengsoo is just a 10-years-old Penguin from the South Pole. General people can think Pengsoo is a \"penguin doll and there is another person in the doll.\" But there is a kind of promise among the Pengsoo's fans. They just see Pengsoo is Pengsoo, not a doll. If you are not a Pengsoo's fan, it can be heard strange to you, but just think of this a kind of the game.\n\n== Influence ==\nHe was chosen as the person of the year.

He denies existed norms and creates his own new rules. People in Korean society, where is very authoritative, get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo because he says what they want to say on behalf of them. Pengsoo always says \"right thing\". Sometimes he says so straight to his boss and even he calls just his boss's name. This could not be imagined in Korean society. Probably, It seems to people get vicarious satisfaction from Pengsoo.

Interviewees included chess grandmasters [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] and [[Anatoly Karpov|Karpov]], and footballer [[Johnny Rep]]. Soon after, he also started interviewing writers, and he was responsible for renewing the literary section of the newspaper. In 1988, he became an editor for the arts section. In 1996, he was promoted to editor-in-chief of ''[[Het Parool]]''.\n\nIn 2001 he became the editor-in-chief of [[AT5]], the local television channel of Amsterdam. However, in 2002 he transferred to national television when he became the net coordinator of the Dutch public channel [[Nederland 3]]. Out of frustration with the inner workings of the Dutch public broadcasting system (which stood in the way of the changes he envisioned), Van Nieuwkerk quit his job. After six months, he started working in front of the cameras. Ahead of the 2003 elections, he presented the political programme ''Nederland Kiest'' with [[Felix Rottenberg]]. The duo started presenting [[Nova (Dutch TV series)|Nova]], a Dutch programme about politics, but they both quit after a conflict with the editorial staff.\n\nIn 2005 Van Nieuwkerk started his daily talk show ''[[De Wereld Draait Door]]'' (literal translation: ''The World Keeps on Turning''; \"draait door\" is also figurative speech for \"goes crazy\"), a popular show that airs on weekdays. The programme received the 2007 [[Gouden Televizierring]] (the Dutch equivalent of the [[Emmy Awards]]) for best TV programme.\nAnother successful programme of his is ''[[Holland Sport]]'', a Monday night programme in which he and co-presenter Wilfried de Jong discuss sports.\nLeo Blokhuis (a music expert) and Van Nieuwkerk created and still present the annual [[Popquiz]] and Top 2000 \u00e0 Go-Go.\nVan Nieuwkerk was nominated for the [[Zilveren Televizier-ster]] for best show host in 2006 and 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/media/article2006669.ece/Oude_bekenden_genomineerd_voor_Televizier-Ring|title=Oude bekenden genomineerd voor Televizier-Ring|date=2 October 2008|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> but didn't win on either occasion.\n\nOn 12 February 2020 it was announced that Matthijs van Nieuwkerk would stop with his progamme ''De Wereld Draait Door'' after the current series, due to finish on 27 March 2020. At the same time Van Nieuwkerk is reported to have signed up with [[BNNVARA]] (Dutch public broadcaster) for another three years and that he is in the process of setting up a series Saturday evening programmes for them, due to run from January 2021<ref>https://pers.bnnvara.nl/matthijs-van-nieuwkerk-tekent-nieuw-driejarig-contract-bij-bnnvara/</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nVan Nieuwkerk established the football magazine 'Hard Gras' with Henk Spaan and wrote several books for it. He likes football and he plays the 'Buitenveldert' team along with Frits Barend.

Interviewees included chess grandmasters [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] and [[Anatoly Karpov|Karpov]], and footballer [[Johnny Rep]]. Soon after, he also started interviewing writers, and he was responsible for renewing the literary section of the newspaper. In 1988, he became an editor for the arts section. In 1996, he was promoted to editor-in-chief of ''[[Het Parool]]''.\n\nIn 2001 he became the editor-in-chief of [[AT5]], the local television channel of Amsterdam. However, in 2002 he transferred to national television when he became the net coordinator of the Dutch public channel [[Nederland 3]]. Out of frustration with the inner workings of the Dutch public broadcasting system (which stood in the way of the changes he envisioned), Van Nieuwkerk quit his job. After six months, he started working in front of the cameras. Ahead of the 2003 elections, he presented the political programme ''Nederland Kiest'' with [[Felix Rottenberg]]. The duo started presenting [[Nova (Dutch TV series)|Nova]], a Dutch programme about politics, but they both quit after a conflict with the editorial staff.\n\nIn 2005 Van Nieuwkerk started his daily talk show ''[[De Wereld Draait Door]]'' (literal translation: ''The World Keeps on Turning''; \"draait door\" is also figurative speech for \"goes crazy\"), a popular show that airs on weekdays. The programme received the 2007 [[Gouden Televizierring]] (the Dutch equivalent of the [[Emmy Awards]]) for best TV programme.\nAnother successful programme of his is ''[[Holland Sport]]'', a Monday night programme in which he and co-presenter Wilfried de Jong discuss sports.\nLeo Blokhuis (a music expert) and Van Nieuwkerk created and still present the annual [[Popquiz]] and Top 2000 \u00e0 Go-Go.\nVan Nieuwkerk was nominated for the [[Zilveren Televizier-ster]] for best show host in 2006 and 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/media/article2006669.ece/Oude_bekenden_genomineerd_voor_Televizier-Ring|title=Oude bekenden genomineerd voor Televizier-Ring|date=2 October 2008|work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> but didn't win on either occasion.\n\nOn 12 February 2020 it was annouced that Matthijs van Nieuwkerk would stop with his progamme ''De Wereld Draait Door'' after the current series, due to finish on 27 March 2020. At the same time Van Nieuwkerk is reported to have signed up with [[BNNVARA]] (Dutch public broadcaster) for another three years and that he is in the process of setting up a series Saturday evening programmes for them, due to run from January 2021<ref>https://pers.bnnvara.nl/matthijs-van-nieuwkerk-tekent-nieuw-driejarig-contract-bij-bnnvara/</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nVan Nieuwkerk established the football magazine 'Hard Gras' with Henk Spaan and wrote several books for it. He likes football and he plays the 'Buitenveldert' team along with Frits Barend. Van Nieuwkerk also played judo, volleyball, baseball, and cricket.\n\nYouth magazine J/M had Van Nieuwkerk as a writer of columns, and he helped write a book about fathers.\nIn the [[Baantjer]] episode \"De moord op de man die weg wilde\", he played a journalist.\n\n==Family==\nVan Nieuwkerk is married to Karin.

It is the sound of ''ng'' in English ''si'''ng'''''. The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u014b}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>N</code>. The IPA symbol {{angbr IPA|[[\u014b]]}} is similar to {{angbr IPA|\u0273}}, the symbol for the [[retroflex nasal]], which has a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem, and to {{angbr IPA|[[\u0272]]}}, the symbol for the [[palatal nasal]], which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem. Both the IPA symbol and the sound are commonly called '[[Eng (letter)|eng]]' or 'engma'.\n\nAs a [[phoneme]], the velar nasal does not occur in many of the indigenous languages of the Americas or in many European or Middle Eastern or Caucasian languages, but it is extremely common in [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] and is also common in many languages of [[African languages|Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[East Asian languages|East Asia]], [[Southeast Asian languages|Southeast Asia]] and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesia]]. While almost all languages have {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} is rarer.<ref>{{harvp|Ladefoged|2005|p=164}}. The oral counterparts {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are found together in almost all languages</ref> Only half of the 469 languages surveyed in {{harvp|Anderson|2008}} had a velar nasal phoneme; as a further curiosity, a large proportion of them limits its occurrence to the [[syllable coda]]. In many languages that do not have the velar nasal as a phoneme, it occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before velar consonants. An example of it used this way is the [[English language|English]] word ''ingredient'', which can be pronounced as either {{IPA|[\u026an\u02c8\u0261ri\u02d0di\u0259nt]}} or {{IPA|[\u026a\u014b\u02c8\u0261ri\u02d0di\u0259nt]}}.\n\nAn example of a language that lacks a phonemic or allophonic velar nasal is [[Russian language|Russian]], in which {{IPA|/n/}} is pronounced as laminal denti-alveolar {{IPAblink|n\u032a}} even before velar consonants.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=160}}\n\nSome languages have the '''pre-velar nasal''',<ref>Instead of \"pre-velar\", it can be called \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\", \"front-velar\", \"palato-velar\", \"post-palatal\", \"retracted palatal\" or \"backed palatal\".</ref> which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical velar nasal, though not as front as the prototypical [[palatal nasal]] - see that article for more information.\n\nConversely, some languages have the '''post-velar nasal''',<ref>Instead of \"post-velar\", it can be called \"retracted velar\", \"backed velar\", \"pre-uvular\", \"advanced uvular\" or \"fronted uvular\".</ref> which is articulated slightly behind the place of articulation of a prototypical velar nasal, though not as back as the prototypical [[uvular nasal]].\n\n==Features==\nFeatures of the voiced velar nasal:\n\n{{nasal stop}}\n{{velar}}\n{{voiced}}\n{{nasal}}\n{{central articulation}}\n{{pulmonic}}\n\n==Occurrence==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2| Language !!

(vector).svg\n|imagesize=150px\n|x-sampa=N\n|kirshenbaum=N\n|braille=1246\n}}\n\nThe '''voiced velar nasal''', also known as '''agma''', from the Greek word for 'fragment', is a type of [[consonant]]al sound, used in some [[Speech communication|spoken]] [[language]]s. It is the sound of ''ng'' in English ''si'''ng'''''. The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u014b}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>N</code>. The IPA symbol {{angbr IPA|[[\u014b]]}} is similar to {{angbr IPA|\u0273}}, the symbol for the [[retroflex nasal]], which has a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem, and to {{angbr IPA|[[\u0272]]}}, the symbol for the [[palatal nasal]], which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem. Both the IPA symbol and the sound are commonly called '[[Eng (letter)|eng]]' or 'engma'.\n\nAs a [[phoneme]], the velar nasal does not occur in many of the indigenous languages of the Americas or in many European or Middle Eastern or Caucasian languages, but it is extremely common in [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] and is also common in many languages of [[African languages|Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[East Asian languages|East Asia]], [[Southeast Asian languages|Southeast Asia]] and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesia]]. While almost all languages have {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} is rarer.<ref>{{harvp|Ladefoged|2005|p=164}}. The oral counterparts {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are found together in almost all languages</ref> Only half of the 469 languages surveyed in {{harvp|Anderson|2008}} had a velar nasal phoneme; as a further curiosity, a large proportion of them limits its occurrence to the [[syllable coda]]. In many languages that do not have the velar nasal as a phoneme, it occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before velar consonants. An example of it used this way is the [[English language|English]] word ''ingredient'', which can be pronounced as either {{IPA|[\u026an\u02c8\u0261ri\u02d0di\u0259nt]}} or {{IPA|[\u026a\u014b\u02c8\u0261ri\u02d0di\u0259nt]}}.\n\nAn example of a language that lacks a phonemic or allophonic velar nasal is [[Russian language|Russian]], in which {{IPA|/n/}} is pronounced as laminal denti-alveolar {{IPAblink|n\u032a}} even before velar consonants.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=160}}\n\nSome languages have the '''pre-velar nasal''',<ref>Instead of \"pre-velar\", it can be called \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\", \"front-velar\", \"palato-velar\", \"post-palatal\", \"retracted palatal\" or \"backed palatal\".</ref> which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical velar nasal, though not as front as the prototypical [[palatal nasal]] - see that article for more information.\n\nConversely, some languages have the '''post-velar nasal''',<ref>Instead of \"post-velar\", it can be called \"retracted velar\", \"backed velar\", \"pre-uvular\", \"advanced uvular\" or \"fronted uvular\".</ref> which is articulated slightly behind the place of articulation of a prototypical velar nasal, though not as back as the prototypical [[uvular nasal]].\n\n==Features==\nFeatures of the voiced velar nasal:\n\n{{nasal stop}}\n{{velar}}\n{{voiced}}\n{{nasal}}\n{{central articulation}}\n{{pulmonic}}\n\n==Occurrence==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2| Language !!

Aalto received the commission to design the College of Education campus following a competition held in 1951. Aalto played on the idea of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4's image among the town's inhabitants as it being the \"Athens of the North\", and layout of the campus reflects principles of Greek acropolis layouts.
