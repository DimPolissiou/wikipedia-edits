Plunkett at Warwick Electronics Inc./[[Thomas Organ Company]] in November 1966. This pedal is the original [[prototype]] made from a [[transistor]]ized MRB (mid-range boost) [[potentiometer]] [[Breadboard|bread-boarded]] [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] and the housing of a [[Vox Continental]] Organ [[volume pedal]].  The concept, however, was not new. Country guitar virtuoso [[Chet Atkins]] had used a similar, self-designed device on his late 1950s recordings of \"Hot Toddy\" and \"Slinkey\". Jazz guitarist [[Peter Van Wood]] had a modified [[Hammond organ]] expression\npedal; he recorded in 1955 a version of [[George Gershwin]]'s \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" with a \"crying\" tone, and other recordings including humorous \"novelty\" effects. A DeArmond Tone and Volume pedal was used in the early 1960s by [[Big Jim Sullivan]], notably in some [[Krew Cats]] instrumental tracks, and in [[Dave Berry (musician)|Dave Berry]]'s song \"The Crying Game\".\n\nThe creation of the modern wah pedal was an accident which stemmed from the redesign of the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] Super Beatle [[Instrument amplifier|guitar amplifier]] in 1966.  Warwick Electronics Inc. also owned Thomas Organ Company and had earlier entered into an agreement with [[Jennings Musical Instruments]] (JMI) of England for Thomas to distribute the Vox name and products in the United States.  In addition to distributing the British-made Vox amplifiers, the Thomas Organ Company also designed and manufactured much of the Vox equipment sold in the US The more highly regarded British Vox amplifiers were designed by Dick Denney and made by JMI, the parent company of Vox.  Warwick assigned Thomas Organ Company to create a new product line of [[Solid-state electronics|solid state]] Vox amplifiers called Vox Amplifonic Orchestra, which included the Super Beatle amplifier, named to capitalize on the Vox brand name's popularity in association with [[the Beatles]], who used the JMI English Vox amplifiers such as the famous [[Vox AC30]] (although the Beatles did use several American-made Super Beatle units on their 1966 US tour).  The US-made Vox product line development was headed by musician and bandleader [[Bill Page]]. While creating the Vox Amplifonic Orchestra, the Thomas Organ Company decided to create an American-made equivalent of the British Vox amplifier but with [[transistor]]ized (solid state) circuits, rather than [[vacuum tube]]s, which would be less expensive to manufacture. During the re-design of the USA Vox amplifier, Stan Cuttler, head engineer of Thomas Organ Company, assigned Brad Plunkett, a junior electronics engineer, to replace the expensive Jennings 3-position MRB circuit switch with a transistorized solid state MRB circuit.\n\nPlunkett had lifted and bread-boarded a transistorized tone-circuit from the Thomas Organ (an electric solid state transistorized organ) to duplicate the Jennings 3-position circuit. After adjusting and testing the amplifier with an [[electronic oscillator]] and [[oscilloscope]], Plunkett connected the output to the speaker and tested the circuit audibly. At that point, several engineers and technical consultants, including Bill Page and [[Del Casher]], noticed the sound effect caused by the circuit. Page insisted on testing this bread-boarded circuit while he played his saxophone through an amplifier. John Glennon, an assistant junior electronics engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, was summoned to bring a volume control pedal which was used in the Vox Continental Organ so that the transistorized MRB potentiometer bread-boarded circuit could be installed in the pedal's housing. After the installation, Page began playing his saxophone through the pedal and had asked Joe Banaron, CEO of Warwick Electronics Inc./Thomas Organ Company, to listen to the effect. At this point the first electric guitar was plugged into the prototype wah pedal by guitarist Del Casher who suggested to Joe Banaron that this was a guitar effects pedal rather than a wind instrument effects pedal. Banaron, being a fan of the [[big band]] style of music, was interested in marketing the wah pedal for wind instruments as suggested by Page rather than for the electric guitar as suggested by Casher. After a remark by Casher to Banaron regarding the [[Harmon mute]] style of trumpet playing in the famous recording of \"[[Sugar Blues (song)|Sugar Blues]]\" from the 1930s, Banaron decided to market the wah-wah pedal using [[Clyde McCoy]]'s name for endorsement.\n\nAfter the invention of the wah pedal, the prototype was modified by Casher and Plunkett to better accommodate the harmonic qualities of the electric guitar. However, since Vox had no intention of marketing the wah pedal for electric guitar players, the prototype wah-wah pedal was given to Del Casher for performances at Vox press conferences and film scores for [[Universal Pictures]]. The un-modified version of the Vox wah pedal was released to the public in February 1967 with an image of Clyde McCoy on the bottom of the pedal.\n\nWarwick Electronics Inc. assigned Lester L. Kushner, an engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, and Brad Plunkett to write and submit the documentation for the wah-wah pedal patent. The patent application was submitted on 24 February 1967, which included technical diagrams of the pedal being connected to a four-stringed \"guitar\" (as noted from the \"Description of the Preferred Embodiment\"). Warwick Electronics Inc. was granted {{US patent| 3530224}} (\"foot-controlled continuously variable preference circuit for musical instruments\") on 22 September 1970.\n\nEarly versions of the Clyde McCoy featured an image of McCoy on the bottom panel, which soon gave way to only his signature. Thomas Organ then wanted the effect branded as their own for the American market, changing it to Cry Baby which was sold in parallel to the Italian Vox V846. Thomas Organ's failure to trademark the Cry Baby name soon led to the market being flooded with Cry Baby imitations from various parts of the world, including Italy, where all of the original Vox and Cry Babys were made.<ref>[http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/vox-v848-clyde/Apr-07/26876 Guitar Player: The Complete Electric Guitar Package<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Jen, who had been responsible for the manufacture of Thomas Organ and Vox wah pedals, also made rebranded pedals for companies such as [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gretsch]] and under their own Jen brand. When Thomas Organ moved production completely to Sepulveda, California and Chicago, Illinois these Italian models continued to be made and are among the more collectible wah pedals today.\n\n== Cream and Jimi Hendrix ==\n[[File:Pink Floyd Their Mortal Remains - 2017-10-13 - Andy Mabbett - 28 (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|[[David Gilmour]]'s VOX Wah Wah guitar effects pedal, as used on ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'' (1972), displayed at the [[Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains]] exhibition]]\n\nSome of the most famous electric guitarists of the day were keen to adopt the wah-wah pedal soon after its release. Among the first recordings featuring wah-wah pedal were \"[[Tales of Brave Ulysses]]\" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]] with [[Eric Clapton]] on guitar and \"[[Burning of the Midnight Lamp]]\" by the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]],<ref>http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/jh1d-7-10137-04796-9.do</ref> both released in 1967. Hendrix also used wah wah on his famous song Voodoo Child, in intro and in soloing. Clapton, in particular, used the device on many of the [[Cream (band)|Cream]] songs included on their second and third albums, ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' (1967) and ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' (1968) respectively.  Clapton would subsequently employ it again on \"[[Wah-Wah (song)|Wah-Wah]]\", from his good friend [[George Harrison]]'s solo album ''[[All Things Must Pass (album)|All Things Must Pass]]'', upon the dissolution of [[The Beatles]] in 1970. Another prominent use occurred in the recording of \"[[Crimson and Clover]]\" by [[Tommy James and the Shondells]] in late 1968, with the single version eventually reaching number one in early 1969. [[Terry Kath]], lead guitarist for the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], used it on many of their early recordings as well. [[Martin Barre]], lead guitarist for the fledgling [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], also employed it to great effect on their second album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', particularly on \"We Used to Know\" and \"Look into the Sun\".  [[Jimmy Page]] featured the wah-wah pedal on several songs from the final [[Yardbirds]] album ''[[Little Games]]'', as well as the solo on the [[Led Zeppelin]] song \"[[Custard Pie]]\", and throughout \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\", both from ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''. [[Tony Iommi]] used it on the songs \"[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]\", \"[[The Wizard (Black Sabbath song)|The Wizard]]\" and [[Geezer Butler]] (Bass) \"[[N.I.B.]]\" from their self-titled debut album, \"[[Electric Funeral]]\" from ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' album. He also employed it on later recordings, such as \"Shock Wave\" on ''[[Never Say Die!]]'' (1978), \"Lady Evil\" from the first [[Ronnie James Dio]]-era album ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1980), and \"Turn Up the Night\" on the subsequent ''[[Mob Rules (album)|Mob Rules]]'' (1981).\n\nThe wah-wah pedal was revived in the British music industry in the late 1980s by [[John Squire]] of [[The Stone Roses]] whose squelching licks graced most of the Roses songs from 1988 to 1990, particularly \"[[Elephant Stone]]\", \"Waterfall\" and in particular \"[[Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For|Fools Gold]]\". By the late 80s Squire had tired of the overly angular guitar riffs which dominated British music and had bought a wah wah pedal to soften the Roses sound. The wah would also be used by the Roses contemporaries such as the Happy Mondays and The Charlatans [UK], and became one of the defining sounds of British guitar music in the late 80s/early 90s.\n\n== Other functions ==\n\nIn addition to rocking the pedal up and down to crest a spectral glide, another function of the pedal is to use it in a fixed position. A guitarist using the wah in this way selects a position on the wah pedal and leaves the pedal there. Depending on the position of the pedal, this will boost or cut a specific frequency. This can be used for emphasizing the \"sweet spot\" in the tonal spectrum of a particular instrument. One electric guitar player to use the pedal in this way was [[Jimi Hendrix]], who revolutionized its application by combining a [[Fender Stratocaster]] with stacked Marshall Amplifiers (in both static and modulated mode) for lead and rhythm guitar applications unheard of before then. According to Del Casher, Hendrix learned about the pedal from [[Frank Zappa]], another well-known early user.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Frank Zappa companion: four decades of commentary\n | first1= Richard\n | last1= Kostelanetz\n | first2= John M.\n | last2= Rocco\n | publisher= Schirmer Books\n | year= 1997\n | isbn= 0-02-864628-2\n | page= 94\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pCYIAQAAMAAJ\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Wallace\n | first= Amy\n | title= With a Flip of a Knob, He Heard the Future\n | work= [[The New York Times]]\n | date= 6 August 2011\n | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/business/del-casher-and-the-story-of-the-wah-wah-pedal.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\n | accessdate= 12 November 2012\n}}\n</ref>\nMilestones of this signature guitar and amplifier combination include songs such as \"[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)]]\" as well as the \"[[Star Spangled Banner]]\" which was played by Hendrix at [[Woodstock]] in 1969.

This is done by muting strings, holding down a chord and moving the pedal at the same time. This was first heard on the song \"Little Miss Lover\" (1967) by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. One of the most famous uses of this effect is heard on [[Isaac Hayes]]'s \"[[Theme from Shaft]]\" (1971), [[Charles Pitts]] playing the guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Boss Book: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Most Popular Compact Effects for Guitar\n | publisher= Hal Leonard\n | year= 2002\n | page= 89\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7uumqHg4zAC&pg=RA1-PT89\n | isbn= 978-0-634-04480-9\n}}\n</ref>\nThe \"wah-wah\" and \"wacka-wacka\" effects are often associated with the bands on 1970s TV [[variety shows]], like those of [[Sonny and Cher]], [[Flip Wilson]], or [[Donny and Marie Osmond]]; or with the soundtracks of [[pornographic films]], the sound referenced in TV commercials for [[Axe (brand)|Axe]] body spray as \"bow chicka wow wow.\"\n\n[[David Gilmour]] ([[Pink Floyd]]) used the pedal to create the \"whale\" effect during ''[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]''. He discovered this effect as a result of a roadie accidentally plugging his guitar into the output of the pedal and the input being plugged into his amp. The effect was first used during live performances of ''[[Embryo (Pink Floyd song)|The Embryo]]'' during 1970 but was then switched into ''Echoes'' as it was being developed before being released on the ''[[Meddle]]'' album on 31 October 1971.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Riis\n | first= Bj\u00f8rn\n | title= Echoes \"seagull\" effect tutorial\n | website= Gilmourish\n | date= 26 October 2009\n | url= http://www.gilmourish.com/?p=754\n | accessdate= 6 April 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other instruments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\nMany bassists have also used the wah-wah effect, for example [[Michael Henderson]] on [[Miles Davis]]'s album ''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972). Funk band [[Kool & the Gang]], [[B. T. Express]], and [[Jimmy Castor Bunch]] also used a wah-wah pedal. Melvin Ragin, better known by the nickname [[Wah Wah Watson]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wahwah.com/history |title= A brief history of Wah Wah Watson |publisher= Wah Wah Watson Music. |accessdate= 17 December 2019}}</ref>, was a member of the Motown Records studio band, The Funk Brothers, where he recorded with artists such as [[The Temptations]] \"Papa was a Rolling Stone\", Marvin Gaye \"Let's Get It On\", [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]], and [[The Supremes]], Undisputed Truth \"Smilin' Faces\".<ref>http://www.wahwah.com/history</ref> He played on numerous sessions in the 1970s and 1980s for many top [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] acts, including [[Herbie Hancock]]. \n\nHeavy Metal bassist [[Cliff Burton]] of [[Metallica]] used a [[Morley Pedals|Morley]] Wah pedal (along with a [[Big Muff]] Distortion) extensively, including on \"[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]\", which is a bass solo recorded for ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983), and \"The Call of Ktulu\" and \"[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\", both recorded for ''[[Ride the Lightning]]''. [[Geezer Butler]], bassist of [[Black Sabbath]], used it when playing his solo \"Bassically\", along with the bass line in \"[[N.I.B.]]\". [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] used a wah-wah pedal on his solo piece \"[[The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)|The Fish]]\" on the album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]''. While wah pedals are less popular as a bass effect, various companies now offer pedals designed specifically for bass guitars.\n\nMany [[steel guitar]] players use a wah-wah, such as Robert Randolph from the [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]].\n\nKeyboardists have also made use of the wah-wah effect both in the studio and during live performances. [[Garth Hudson]] famously used a wah-wah pedal on a [[clavinet]] in [[The Band]]'s song \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\" to emulate a [[jaw harp]]. [[Richard Wright (musician)|Rick Wright]] of Pink Floyd played a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] through a wah-wah pedal in their song \"[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]\" to give the impression of many consecutive chords being played. [[John Medeski]] of [[Medeski, Martin, and Wood]] uses a wah pedal with his clavinet.\n\nMany [[jazz fusion]] records feature wind and brass instruments with the effect \u2013 Miles Davis's trumpet being a well-known example. Davis first used this technique in 1970 (at concerts documented on ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' and ''[[The Cellar Door Sessions]]'') at a time when he also made his keyboard players ([[Keith Jarrett]] and [[Chick Corea]]) play [[electric piano]]s with a wah-wah pedal. [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] played a saxophone amplified through a wah-wah pedal in the [[Frank Zappa]] movie ''[[The Dub Room Special]]'', as well as on some of Zappa's albums. [[David Sanborn]] can be heard playing an alto saxophone modified by a wah-wah pedal on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]''. Noted saxophonist [[King Curtis]] was also known to use a wah-wah pedal. Dick Sims, the keyboard player with Eric Clapton in the late 1970s, used a Hammond organ in conjunction with a wah-wah pedal.\n\nThe effect is also extensively used with the electric violin. Notable examples are [[Jerry Goodman]] with the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and [[L. Shankar|Shankar]] with [[Frank Zappa]], all usually engaged in long wah-wah violin/guitar duels. [[Boyd Tinsley]] of the [[Dave Matthews Band]] is known to use a wah-wah pedal live.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Talk box]]\n*[[Equalization (audio)|EQ]]\n*[[Auto-wah]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further information==\n* ''Cry Baby: The Pedal that Rocks the World'' (documentary, 2011)\n\n{{Music production}}\n{{Music technology}}\n\n[[Category:Audio engineering]]\n[[Category:Effects units]]\n[[Category:Tone, EQ and filter]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Thomas Organ Crybaby.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Thomas Organ Cry Baby (1970) manufactured by JEN]]\n[[File:Wah-wah + distortion (guitar).ogg|thumb|Wah-wah pedal ([[Dunlop Manufacturing|Dunlop]] Crybaby 535q) on electric guitar with [[Distortion (music)|distortion]].]]\n\nA '''wah-wah pedal''' (or simply '''wah pedal''') is a type of electric guitar [[effects unit|effects pedal]] that alters the tone and frequencies of the guitar signal to create a distinctive sound, mimicking the [[human voice]] saying the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] name \"wah-wah\".

Another prominent use occurred in the recording of \"[[Crimson and Clover]]\" by [[Tommy James and the Shondells]] in late 1968, with the single version eventually reaching number one in early 1969. [[Terry Kath]], lead guitarist for the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], used it on many of their early recordings as well. [[Martin Barre]], lead guitarist for the fledgling [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], also employed it to great effect on their second album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', particularly on \"We Used to Know\" and \"Look into the Sun\".  [[Jimmy Page]] featured the wah-wah pedal on several songs from the final [[Yardbirds]] album ''[[Little Games]]'', as well as the solo on the [[Led Zeppelin]] song \"[[Custard Pie]]\", and throughout \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\", both from ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''. [[Tony Iommi]] used it on the songs \"[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]\", \"[[The Wizard (Black Sabbath song)|The Wizard]]\" and [[Geezer Butler]] (Bass) \"[[N.I.B.]]\" from their self-titled debut album, \"[[Electric Funeral]]\" from ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' album. He also employed it on later recordings, such as \"Shock Wave\" on ''[[Never Say Die!]]'' (1978), \"Lady Evil\" from the first [[Ronnie James Dio]]-era album ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1980), and \"Turn Up the Night\" on the subsequent ''[[Mob Rules (album)|Mob Rules]]'' (1981).\n\nThe wah-wah pedal was revived in the British music industry in the late 1980s by [[John Squire]] of [[The Stone Roses]] whose squelching licks graced most of the Roses songs from 1988 to 1990, particularly \"[[Elephant Stone]]\", \"Waterfall\" and in particular \"[[Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For|Fools Gold]]\". By the late 80s Squire had tired of the overly angular guitar riffs which dominated British music and had bought a wah wah pedal to soften the Roses sound. The wah would also be used by the Roses contemporaries such as the Happy Mondays and The Charlatans [UK], and became one of the defining sounds of British guitar music in the late 80s/early 90s.\n\n== Other functions ==\n\nIn addition to rocking the pedal up and down to crest a spectral glide, another function of the pedal is to use it in a fixed position. A guitarist using the wah in this way selects a position on the wah pedal and leaves the pedal there. Depending on the position of the pedal, this will boost or cut a specific frequency. This can be used for emphasizing the \"sweet spot\" in the tonal spectrum of a particular instrument. One electric guitar player to use the pedal in this way was [[Jimi Hendrix]], who revolutionized its application by combining a [[Fender Stratocaster]] with stacked Marshall Amplifiers (in both static and modulated mode) for lead and rhythm guitar applications unheard of before then. According to Del Casher, Hendrix learned about the pedal from [[Frank Zappa]], another well-known early user.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Frank Zappa companion: four decades of commentary\n | first1= Richard\n | last1= Kostelanetz\n | first2= John M.\n | last2= Rocco\n | publisher= Schirmer Books\n | year= 1997\n | isbn= 0-02-864628-2\n | page= 94\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pCYIAQAAMAAJ\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Wallace\n | first= Amy\n | title= With a Flip of a Knob, He Heard the Future\n | work= [[The New York Times]]\n | date= 6 August 2011\n | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/business/del-casher-and-the-story-of-the-wah-wah-pedal.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\n | accessdate= 12 November 2012\n}}\n</ref>\nMilestones of this signature guitar and amplifier combination include songs such as \"[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)]]\" as well as the \"[[Star Spangled Banner]]\" which was played by Hendrix at [[Woodstock]] in 1969.

This is done by muting strings, holding down a chord and moving the pedal at the same time. This was first heard on the song \"Little Miss Lover\" (1967) by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. One of the most famous uses of this effect is heard on [[Isaac Hayes]]'s \"[[Theme from Shaft]]\" (1971), [[Charles Pitts]] playing the guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Boss Book: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Most Popular Compact Effects for Guitar\n | publisher= Hal Leonard\n | year= 2002\n | page= 89\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7uumqHg4zAC&pg=RA1-PT89\n | isbn= 978-0-634-04480-9\n}}\n</ref>\nThe \"wah-wah\" and \"wacka-wacka\" effects are often associated with the bands on 1970s TV [[variety shows]], like those of [[Sonny and Cher]], [[Flip Wilson]], or [[Donny and Marie Osmond]]; or with the soundtracks of [[pornographic films]], the sound referenced in TV commercials for [[Axe (brand)|Axe]] body spray as \"bow chicka wow wow.\"\n\n[[David Gilmour]] ([[Pink Floyd]]) used the pedal to create the \"whale\" effect during ''[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]''. He discovered this effect as a result of a roadie accidentally plugging his guitar into the output of the pedal and the input being plugged into his amp. The effect was first used during live performances of ''[[Embryo (Pink Floyd song)|The Embryo]]'' during 1970 but was then switched into ''Echoes'' as it was being developed before being released on the ''[[Meddle]]'' album on 31 October 1971.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Riis\n | first= Bj\u00f8rn\n | title= Echoes \"seagull\" effect tutorial\n | website= Gilmourish\n | date= 26 October 2009\n | url= http://www.gilmourish.com/?p=754\n | accessdate= 6 April 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other instruments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\nMany bassists have also used the wah-wah effect, for example [[Michael Henderson]] on [[Miles Davis]]'s album ''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972). Funk band [[Kool & the Gang]], [[B. T. Express]], and [[Jimmy Castor Bunch]] also used a wah-wah pedal. Melvin Ragin, better known by the nickname [[Wah Wah Watson]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wahwah.com/history |title= A brief history of Wah Wah Watson |publisher= Wah Wah Watson Music. |accessdate= 17 December 2019}}</ref>, was a member of the Motown Records studio band, The Funk Brothers, where he recorded with artists such as [[The Temptations]] \"Papa was a Rolling Stone\", Marvin Gaye \"Let's Get It On\", [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]], and [[The Supremes]], Undisputed Truth \"Smilin' Faces\".<ref>http://www.wahwah.com/history</ref> He played on numerous sessions in the 1970s and 1980s for many top [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] acts, including [[Herbie Hancock]]. \n\nHeavy Metal bassist [[Cliff Burton]] of [[Metallica]] used a [[Morley Pedals|Morley]] Wah pedal (along with a [[Big Muff]] Distortion) extensively, including on \"[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]\", which is a bass solo recorded for ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983), and \"The Call of Ktulu\" and \"[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\", both recorded for ''[[Ride the Lightning]]''. [[Geezer Butler]], bassist of [[Black Sabbath]], used it when playing his solo \"Bassically\", along with the bass line in \"[[N.I.B.]]\". [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] used a wah-wah pedal on his solo piece \"[[The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)|The Fish]]\" on the album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]''. While wah pedals are less popular as a bass effect, various companies now offer pedals designed specifically for bass guitars.\n\nMany [[steel guitar]] players use a wah-wah, such as Robert Randolph from the [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]].\n\nKeyboardists have also made use of the wah-wah effect both in the studio and during live performances. [[Garth Hudson]] famously used a wah-wah pedal on a [[clavinet]] in [[The Band]]'s song \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\" to emulate a [[jaw harp]]. [[Richard Wright (musician)|Rick Wright]] of Pink Floyd played a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] through a wah-wah pedal in their song \"[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]\" to give the impression of many consecutive chords being played. [[John Medeski]] of [[Medeski, Martin, and Wood]] uses a wah pedal with his clavinet.\n\nMany [[jazz fusion]] records feature wind and brass instruments with the effect \u2013 Miles Davis's trumpet being a well-known example. Davis first used this technique in 1970 (at concerts documented on ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' and ''[[The Cellar Door Sessions]]'') at a time when he also made his keyboard players ([[Keith Jarrett]] and [[Chick Corea]]) play [[electric piano]]s with a wah-wah pedal. [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] played a saxophone amplified through a wah-wah pedal in the [[Frank Zappa]] movie ''[[The Dub Room Special]]'', as well as on some of Zappa's albums. [[David Sanborn]] can be heard playing an alto saxophone modified by a wah-wah pedal on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]''. Noted saxophonist [[King Curtis]] was also known to use a wah-wah pedal. Dick Sims, the keyboard player with Eric Clapton in the late 1970s, used a Hammond organ in conjunction with a wah-wah pedal.\n\nThe effect is also extensively used with the electric violin. Notable examples are [[Jerry Goodman]] with the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and [[L. Shankar|Shankar]] with [[Frank Zappa]], all usually engaged in long wah-wah violin/guitar duels. [[Boyd Tinsley]] of the [[Dave Matthews Band]] is known to use a wah-wah pedal live.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Talk box]]\n*[[Equalization (audio)|EQ]]\n*[[Auto-wah]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further information==\n* ''Cry Baby: The Pedal that Rocks the World'' (documentary, 2011)\n\n{{Music production}}\n{{Music technology}}\n\n[[Category:Audio engineering]]\n[[Category:Effects units]]\n[[Category:Tone, EQ and filter]]\n", "name_user": "Bumm13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:formatting fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah-wah_pedal"}

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer \u2013 C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer's wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n: The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer, on the other hand, gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability, and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organizations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities. Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>, Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nA marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]: This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]): This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organization's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer \u2013 C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer's wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants. This orientation seeks to attain the highest possible sales through promotion and direct sales techniques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Kotler|first=Philip|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1980|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}</ref> The sales orientation \"is typically practiced with unsought goods.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29</ref> One study found that industrial companies are more likely to hold a sales orientation than consumer goods companies.<ref>Avlonitis, G.J. and Gounaris, S.P., \"Marketing Orientation and Company Performance: Industrial vs. Consumer Goods Companies,\" ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 26, 1997, pp. 385\u2013402</ref> The approach may also suit scenarios in which a firm holds dead stock, or otherwise sells a product that is in high demand, with little likelihood of changes in consumer tastes diminishing demand.\n\nA 2011 meta analyses<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11747-010-0211-8|title = Drivers of sales performance: A contemporary meta-analysis.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n: The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer, on the other hand, gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability, and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organizations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities. Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>, Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nA marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}</ref><ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, Christian. \"From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing,\" ''Management Decision,'' vol. 32, no. 2, 1994, pp. 4\u201320.</ref>\n[[File:Marketing Mix 4P.svg|alt=The 4Ps of the marketing mix stand for product, price, place and promotion|thumb|278x278px|One version of the marketing mix is the 4Ps method.]]\n\n==== Outline ====\n\n;[[Product (business)|Product]]\n: The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the [[end-user]]'s needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]: This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]): This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organization's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

A feint towards the Turkish right flank at [[Eski\u015fehir]] distracted [[Ismet Pasha]] just as the major assault fell on the left at [[Afyonkarahisar|Kara Hisar]]. The Greeks then wheeled their axis to the north and swept towards Eski\u015fehir, rolling up the Turkish defence in a series of frontal assaults combined with flanking movements.<ref name=\"Christopher Chant, pg.22\">Christopher Chant, pg. 22</ref>\n\nEski\u015fehir fell on July 17, despite a vigorous counter-attack by Ismet Pasha who was determined to fight to the finish. The saner counsels of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] prevailed, however, and Ismet disengaged with great losses to reach the comparative safety of the [[Sakarya River]], some 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) to the north and only 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) from [[Ankara]].<ref>Christopher Chant, pg. 22.</ref>\n[[File:Sakaryarivermapfinal.jpg|thumb|The battle took place along the [[Sakarya River]] around the vicinity of [[Polatl\u0131]], stretching a 62 miles long battle line.]]\nThe determining feature of the terrain was the river itself, which flows eastward across the plateau, suddenly curves north and then turns back westwards describing a great loop that forms a natural barrier. The river banks are awkward and steep, and bridges were few, there being only two on the frontal section of the loop. East of the loop, the landscape rises before an invader in rocky, barren ridges and hills towards Ankara. It was here in these hills, east of the river that the Turks dug in their defensive positions. The front followed the hills east of the Sakarya River from a point near [[Polatl\u0131]] southwards to where the G\u00f6k River joins the Sakarya, and then swung at rightangles eastwards following the line of the G\u00f6k River. It was an excellent defensive ground.<ref>Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg. 227</ref>\n\nFor the Greeks, the question on whether to dig in and rest on their previous gains, or to advance towards Ankara in great effort and destroy the [[Turkish Army#History|Army of the Grand National Assembly]] was difficult to resolve, posing the eternal problems that the Greek staff had to deal with since the beginning of the war. The dangers of extending the lines of communications still further in such an inhospitable terrain that killed horses, caused vehicles to break down and prevented the movement of heavy artillery were obvious. The present front that gave the Greeks the control of the essential strategic railway was tactically most favourable. But because the Army of the Grand National Assembly had escaped encirclement at [[K\u00fctahya]], nothing had been settled; therefore the temptation of achieving a \u201cknock-out-blow\u201d became irresistible.<ref>Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg. 228</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:M.Asia-almyra-erimos.JPG|thumb|The Greek 9th infantry division marches through the steppe]]\n[[File:Aikhmalotoi.JPG|thumb|Turkish POW during the Battle of Sakarya]]\n\nOn August 10, Constantine finally committed his forces to an assault against the Sakarya Line. The Greeks marched hard for nine days before making contact with the enemy. This march included an outflanking manoeuvre through the northern part of [[Anatolia]] through the [[Lake Tuz|Salt Desert]] where food and water scarcely existed, so the advancing infantry foraged the poor Turkish villages for maize and water or obtain meat from the flocks which were pastured on the fringe of the desert.<ref name=\"Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg.233\">Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg. 233</ref>\n\nOn August 23, battle was finally joined when Greeks made contact with advanced Turkish positions south of the G\u00f6k River. The Turkish Staff had made their headquarters at Polatl\u0131 on the railway a few miles east of the coast of the Sakarya River and the troops were prepared to resist.\n\nOn August 26, the Greeks attacked all along the line. Crossing the shallow G\u00f6k, the infantry fought its way step up onto the heights where every ridge and hill top had to be stormed against strong entrenchments and withering fire.\n\nBy September 2 the commanding heights of the key Mount Chal were in Greek hands, but once the Greek enveloping movement against the Turkish left flank had failed, the Battle of the Sakarya River descended to a typical head-on confrontation of infantry, machine-guns and artillery.<ref name=\"Christopher Chant, pg.22\"/> The Greeks launched their main effort in the centre, pushing forward some 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) in 10 days, through the Turkish Second Line of defense. Some Greek units came as close as 31 miles (50&nbsp;km) to the city of [[Ankara]].<ref>''\u00d6sterreichische Milit\u00e4rische Zeitschrift'', Verlag C.

East of the loop, the landscape rises before an invader in rocky, barren ridges and hills towards Ankara. It was here in these hills, east of the river that the Turks dug in their defensive positions. The front followed the hills east of the Sakarya River from a point near [[Polatl\u0131]] southwards to where the G\u00f6k River joins the Sakarya, and then swung at rightangles eastwards following the line of the G\u00f6k River. It was an excellent defensive ground.<ref>Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg. 227</ref>\n\nFor the Greeks, the question on whether to dig in and rest on their previous gains, or to advance towards Ankara in great effort and destroy the [[Turkish Army#History|Army of the Grand National Assembly]] was difficult to resolve, posing the eternal problems that the Greek staff had to deal with since the beginning of the war. The dangers of extending the lines of communications still further in such an inhospitable terrain that killed horses, caused vehicles to break down and prevented the movement of heavy artillery were obvious. The present front that gave the Greeks the control of the essential strategic railway was tactically most favourable. But because the Army of the Grand National Assembly had escaped encirclement at [[K\u00fctahya]], nothing had been settled; therefore the temptation of achieving a \u201cknock-out-blow\u201d became irresistible.<ref>Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg. 228</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:M.Asia-almyra-erimos.JPG|thumb|The Greek 9th infantry division marches through the steppe]]\n[[File:Aikhmalotoi.JPG|thumb|Turkish POW during the Battle of Sakarya]]\n\nOn August 10, Constantine finally committed his forces to an assault against the Sakarya Line. The Greeks marched hard for nine days before making contact with the enemy. This march included an outflanking manoeuvre through the northern part of [[Anatolia]] through the [[Lake Tuz|Salt Desert]] where food and water scarcely existed, so the advancing infantry foraged the poor Turkish villages for maize and water or obtain meat from the flocks which were pastured on the fringe of the desert.<ref name=\"Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg.233\">Michael Llewellyn Smith, pg. 233</ref>\n\nOn August 23, battle was finally joined when Greeks made contact with advanced Turkish positions south of the G\u00f6k River. The Turkish Staff had made their headquarters at Polatl\u0131 on the railway a few miles east of the coast of the Sakarya River and the troops were prepared to resist.\n\nOn August 26, the Greeks attacked all along the line. Crossing the shallow G\u00f6k, the infantry fought its way step up onto the heights where every ridge and hill top had to be stormed against strong entrenchments and withering fire.\n\nBy September 2 the commanding heights of the key Mount Chal were in Greek hands, but once the Greek enveloping movement against the Turkish left flank had failed, the Battle of the Sakarya River descended to a typical head-on confrontation of infantry, machine-guns and artillery.<ref name=\"Christopher Chant, pg.22\"/> The Greeks launched their main effort in the centre, pushing forward some 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) in 10 days, through the Turkish Second Line of defense.

Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

{"title_page": "Attorney general", "text_new": "{{short description|In common law jurisdictions, main legal advisor to the government}}\nIn most [[common law]] jurisdictions, the '''attorney general''' or '''attorney-general''' (sometimes abbreviated '''AG''') is the main legal advisor to the [[government]]. The plural is '''attorneys general''' or '''attorneys-general'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/attorney-general|title=Attorney General definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attorney+general|title=Definition of ATTORNEY GENERAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n\nIn some jurisdictions, attorneys general also have executive responsibility for [[law enforcement]], prosecutions or even responsibility for legal affairs generally. In practice, the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions, and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction, often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder's prior legal experience.\n\nWhere the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general (as is the case, for example, with the [[United States Attorney General]] or the [[Attorney-General for Australia]], and the respective [[State attorney general|attorneys general]] of the states in each country), the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]] in some other countries.\n\nThe term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general [[power of attorney]] to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could, in the past, be referred to as such, even if only for a particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions, the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.\n\n[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have similar offices, which may be variously called \"[[public prosecutor general (disambiguation)|public prosecutor general]]\", \"procurators\", \"[[Advocate General|advocates general]]\", \"public attorneys\", and other titles. Many of these offices also use \"attorney general\" or \"attorney-general\" as the English translation of the title, although because of different historical provenance, the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn regard to the [[etymology]] of the phrase ''Attorney General'', [[Steven Pinker]] writes that the earliest citation in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] is from 1292: \"Tous attorneyz general purrount lever fins et cirrographer\" (All general attorneys may levy fines and make legal documents).<ref name=\"SP-ZWords\">{{cite book|last1=Pinker |first1=Steven |title=Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language |date=1999 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-465-07269-0 |pages=25, 28 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=HeA4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steven+Pinker+Words+and+rules+:+the+ingredients+of+language&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_pKis8e7TAhXkJZoKHQ98BnkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=attorneyz%20general&f=false |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> The phrase was borrowed from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] when England was ruled by [[Normans]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in the 11th-century. As a variety of French, which was spoken in the law courts, schools, universities and in sections of the gentry and the bourgeoisie, the term relating to government got introduced into English. The phrase ''attorney general'' is composed of a noun followed by the [[postpositive adjective]] ''general'' and as other [[English plurals#French compounds|French compounds]] its plural form also appears as ''\"attorneys generals\"''.<ref name=\"Haaretz-attorneys-general\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Attorneys Generals Protest Trump's Ban: Liberty Is Bedrock of Our Country|url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.768331|publisher=Haaretz.com|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-attorneys-generals\">{{cite web|title=Former Attorneys Generals at Work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/19/us/politics/1-Former-Attorneys-Generals-at-Work.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> As compared to ''[[major general]]s,'' a term that also originates from French (\"[[:fr:major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]\") and also has a postpositive adjective, it also appears as ''\"attorney generals\"''. Steven Pinker writes: \"So if you are ever challenged for saying ''attorney-generals,'' ''mother-in-laws'', ''passerbys'' ... you can reply, 'They are the very model of the modern ''major general''.'\"<ref name=\"SP-ZWords\"/>\n\n==Attorneys-general in common law and hybrid jurisdictions==\nAttorneys-General in common law jurisdictions, and jurisdictions with a legal system which is partially derived from the common law tradition, share a common provenance.\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Attorney-General for Australia}}\nIn [[Australia]], the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]] is the chief law officer of [[King of Australia|the Crown]] and a member of the [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]]. The Attorney-General is the minister responsible for legal affairs, national and public security, and the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]]. [[Christian Porter]] is the current Attorney-General. The Australian states each have separate [[Attorney-General for Australia|attorneys-general]], who are state ministers with similar responsibilities to the federal minister with respect to state law.\n\nFunctions of the state and federal attorneys-general include the administration of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial posts, and authorizing prosecutions. In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and staff; however, the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties.

In practice, the extent to which the attorney general personally provides legal advice to the government varies between jurisdictions, and even between individual office-holders within the same jurisdiction, often depending on the level and nature of the office-holder's prior legal experience.\n\nWhere the attorney general has ministerial responsibility for legal affairs in general (as is the case, for example, with the [[United States Attorney General]] or the [[Attorney-General for Australia]], and the respective [[State attorney general|attorneys general]] of the states in each country), the ministerial portfolio is largely equivalent to that of a [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]] in some other countries.\n\nThe term was originally used to refer to any person who holds a general [[power of attorney]] to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who came to represent the state in the same way could, in the past, be referred to as such, even if only for a particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions, the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.\n\n[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have similar offices, which may be variously called \"[[public prosecutor general (disambiguation)|public prosecutor general]]\", \"procurators\", \"[[Advocate General|advocates general]]\", \"public attorneys\", and other titles. Many of these offices also use \"attorney general\" or \"attorney-general\" as the English translation of the title, although because of different historical provenance, the nature of such offices is usually different from that of attorneys-general in common law jurisdictions.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn regard to the [[etymology]] of the phrase ''Attorney General'', [[Steven Pinker]] writes that the earliest citation in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] is from 1292: \"Tous attorneyz general purrount lever fins et cirrographer\" (All general attorneys may levy fines and make legal documents).<ref name=\"SP-ZWords\">{{cite book|last1=Pinker |first1=Steven |title=Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language |date=1999 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY |isbn=0-465-07269-0 |pages=25, 28 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=HeA4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steven+Pinker+Words+and+rules+:+the+ingredients+of+language&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_pKis8e7TAhXkJZoKHQ98BnkQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=attorneyz%20general&f=false |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> The phrase was borrowed from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] when England was ruled by [[Normans]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] in the 11th-century. As a variety of French, which was spoken in the law courts, schools, universities and in sections of the gentry and the bourgeoisie, the term relating to government got introduced into English. The phrase ''attorney general'' is composed of a noun followed by the [[postpositive adjective]] ''general'' and as other [[English plurals#French compounds|French compounds]] its plural form also appears as ''\"attorneys generals\"''.<ref name=\"Haaretz-attorneys-general\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Attorneys Generals Protest Trump's Ban: Liberty Is Bedrock of Our Country|url=http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.768331|publisher=Haaretz.com|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-attorneys-generals\">{{cite web|title=Former Attorneys Generals at Work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/19/us/politics/1-Former-Attorneys-Generals-at-Work.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> As compared to ''[[major general]]s,'' a term that also originates from French (\"[[:fr:major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|major-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]\") and also has a postpositive adjective, it also appears as ''\"attorney generals\"''.

In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and staff; however, the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The Attorney-General also has the power to issue a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.\n\nFor the attorneys-general of the various [[states and territories of Australia]] see:\n* [[Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory]]\n* [[Attorney-General of New South Wales]]\n* [[Attorney-General of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Queensland]]\n* [[Attorney-General of South Australia]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Tasmania]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Victoria]]\n* [[Attorney-General of Western Australia]]\n\n===Bangladesh===\n{{Main|Attorney-General of Bangladesh}}\n\n===Barbados===\n{{Main|Attorney-General of Barbados}}\n\n===British Virgin Islands===\n{{Main|Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands}}\n\n===Canada===\n{{main|Canadian Minister of Justice|Canadian Minister of Public Safety}}\nThe [[Attorney General of Canada]] ({{lang-fr|Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada}}) is a separate title held by the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Canadian Minister of Justice]] (''{{lang|fr|Ministre de la Justice}}''), a member of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]].
