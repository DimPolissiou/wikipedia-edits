Going to the equivalent of their house, they find a new time machine and pad then return to Jamestown to set things right. As soon as their original counterparts leave, they take back the guns and return to the proper time.\n\nTired of their close calls, Stewie makes a snap decision to destroy his time machine and crushes the remains at the junkyard. While there, Stewie and Brian find a street hockey net and take it home for exercise. The first time they set it up, Brian is hit and critically injured by an out-of-control driver. At the vet, the Griffins learn that Brian's injuries are too overwhelming to overcome, and the family says their goodbyes. Just before he dies, Brian expresses his love for the family, thanking them for the wonderful life they gave him.\n\nBack home, while picking up the broken pieces of the hockey net, Stewie blames himself and the time machine for Brian's death. Stewie then realizes he can rebuild the time machine and use it to save Brian. Unfortunately, his dealer is unable to supply him with needed parts due to his connection being killed for unknowingly [[Depictions of Muhammad|drawing Muhammad]]. The family and friends hold a funeral for Brian where Peter gives a tear-jerking eulogy. At the funeral, Joe is pressured by a mourning black woman to find who killed Brian, and Quagmire, [[Jerome Is the New Black|who loathes Brian]], does not pay attention to the service and he instead watches a video on his cellphone complaining at [[Red Sox]] designated hitter [[David Ortiz]] to \"stop swinging at junk\". As Brian's casket is lowered into his grave, Stewie throws a final red rose onto the casket and he and the Griffin family watch on tearfully.\n\nA month later, the Griffin family still misses Brian dearly and Lois decides the best way for them to recover is to get a new dog. Peter chooses an Italian smooth-talking dog named Vinny at the pet shop. At home, Vinny offers to make dinner and ingratiates himself with the family. At the Drunken Clam, Peter introduces Vinny to Joe and Quagmire and they become drinking buddies. Stewie is still not happy with Vinny and decides to ruin him. Stewie feeds him some sad Italian news hoping to break his heart, but Chris ruins it for Stewie. Later, Vinny hears Stewie crying and finds he is still upset over Brian. Vinny offers some comfort, talking about the death of his previous owner Leo, and proving he knows what it is like to lose your best friend. Vinny says even in the pet shop, he felt a kinship with the Griffin family. Stewie finally accepts Vinny into the family. Later that night, Vinny goes to sleep beside Stewie's bed.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:100401-N-0696M-202 Tony Sirico (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Tony Sirico]] guest-starred in the episode.]]\nIn November 2013, ''[[Family Guy]]'' writer [[Steve Callaghan]] told [[E!]] about why they decided to kill off Brian in the episode, saying: \"Well, this was an idea that got pitched in the writers room and it sort of caught fire, and we thought it could be a fun way to shake things up.

As much as we love Brian, and as much as everyone loves their pets, we felt it would be more traumatic to lose one of the kids, rather than the family pet.\"<ref name=\"eonline1\"/>\n\nHe also discussed how the other ''Family Guy'' actors reacted when they heard Brian would be killed in the episode, saying: \"I think they were glad it wasn't them.

We felt that we needed to fill that role.\"<ref name=\"eonline1\"/>\n\nHe went on to explain why they decided to get [[Tony Sirico]] to voice Vinny saying: \"I think it was Seth's idea actually to get Tony to come in.
