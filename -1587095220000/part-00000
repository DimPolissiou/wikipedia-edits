He is one of only five players to have won all four majors: the [[Masters Tournament]], [[The Open Championship|The Open]] (despite only playing once), the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and the [[PGA Championship]]. The other four are Nicklaus, Woods, Player, and [[Gene Sarazen]]; Hogan's [[1946 PGA Championship|first major win]] came at age&nbsp;34.\n\n==Early life and character==\nHogan was born in [[Stephenville, Texas]], the third and youngest child of Chester and Clara (Williams) Hogan. His father was a [[blacksmith]] and the family lived {{convert|10|mi|spell=in}} southwest in [[Dublin, Texas|Dublin]] until 1921, when they moved {{convert|70|mi|spell=in}} northeast to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed [[suicide]] with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years.<ref>{{ cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2004/nf20040618_7190_db028.htm |title=The Hard Life of a Golfing Great |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=June 18, 2004 |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308013656/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2004/nf20040618_7190_db028.htm |archivedate=March 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their [[seamstress]] mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold [[newspaper]]s after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to [[caddying]] at age eleven at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course {{convert|7|mi|spell=in}} to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was [[Byron Nelson]], later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were fifteen. Nelson sank a {{convert|30|ft|0|adj=on}} putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]], they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke.\n\nThe following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz.\n\n==Turns professional==\nHogan dropped out of [[R. L. Paschal High School|Central High School]] during the final semester of his senior year. He turned pro in the golf industry six months shy of his 18th birthday at the Texas Open in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], in late January 1930. Hogan met Valerie Fox in Sunday school in Fort Worth in the mid-1920s, and they reacquainted in 1932 when he landed a low-paying club pro job in [[Cleburne, Texas|Cleburne]], where her family had moved. They married in April 1935 at her parents' home.\n\nHogan's early years as a pro were very difficult; he went broke more than once.

He worked at Century as an assistant and then as the head pro until 1941, when he took the head pro job at [[Hershey Country Club]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Career-threatening accident==\nDuring Hogan's prime years of 1938 through 1959, he won 63 professional golf tournaments despite the interruption of his career by [[World War II]] and a near-fatal car accident. Hogan served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] from March 1943 to June 1945; he was stationed locally at Fort Worth and became a utility pilot with the rank of [[First lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|lieutenant]].\n\nDriving home to Fort Worth after a Monday playoff loss at the 1949 [[Phoenix Open]],<ref name=dbhogpo>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ChkSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zvADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673%2C126486 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=United Press |title=Demaret beats Hogan for title |date=February 1, 1949 |page=10}}</ref> Hogan and his wife Valerie survived a head-on collision with a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus east of [[Van Horn, Texas]].

Hogan, 40, was unable to enter\u2014and possibly win\u2014the 1953 [[PGA Championship]] (to complete the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]]) because its play (July 1\u20137) overlapped the play of The Open at Carnoustie (July 6\u201310), which he won. It was the only time that a golfer had won three major professional championships in a year until [[Tiger Woods]] won the final three majors in 2000 (and the first in 2001).\n\nHogan often declined to play in the PGA Championship; he skipped it more and more often as his career wore on. There were two reasons for this. First, the PGA Championship was, until 1958, a [[match play]] event, and Hogan's particular skill was \"shooting a number\"\u2014meticulously planning and executing a strategy to achieve a score for a round on a particular course (even to the point of leaving out the 7-iron in the U.S. Open at [[Merion Golf Club|Merion]], saying \"there are no 7-iron shots at Merion\"). Second, the PGA required several days of 36 holes per day competition, and after his 1949 auto accident, Hogan struggled to manage more than 18 holes a day.\n\nAfter the win at Carnoustie, Hogan and his wife Valerie were passengers on the SS ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' westbound to [[New York City]], where he received a [[List of ticker-tape parades in New York City|ticker tape parade]] down [[Broadway (Manhattan)#Nicknamed sections|Broadway]] on July&nbsp;21.<ref name=whittp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hCFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=suIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6983%2C4536275 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=United Press |title=150,000 welcome Hogan in ticker-tape parade |date=July 22, 1953 |page=2B}}</ref><ref name=welcthaw>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZDFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5076%2C7994228 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |last=Grimsley |first=Will |title=New York welcome thaws Ben Hogan |date=July 22, 1953 |page=13}}</ref>\n\n==Hogan's golf swing==\nBen Hogan is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest ball strikers who ever played golf. Although he had a formidable record with 64 PGA tour victories, it is Hogan's ball-striking ability that mostly underpins his modern reputation.\n\nHogan was known to practice more than any of his contemporary golfers and is said to have \"invented practice\". On this matter, Hogan himself said, \"You hear stories about me beating my brains out practicing, but... I was enjoying myself. I couldn't wait to get up in the morning, so I could hit balls. When I'm hitting the ball where I want, hard and crisply, it's a joy that very few people experience.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Apfelbaum |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn=978-1-60239-014-0}}</ref> He was also one of the first players to match particular clubs to yardages, or reference points around the course such as bunkers or trees, in order to improve his distance control.\n\nHogan thought that an individual's golf swing was \"in the dirt\" and that mastering it required plenty of practice and repetition. He is also known to have spent years contemplating the golf swing, trying a range of theories and methods before arriving at the finished method which brought him his greatest period of success.\n\nThe young Hogan was badly afflicted by hooking the golf ball. Although slight of build at 5'8\u00bd\" and 145 pounds<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Len |first2=Barbara |last2=Kelly |title=Who's Who in Golf |year=1976 |publisher=Arlington House |location=New Rochelle, New York |isbn=0-87000-225-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/whoswhoingolf00elli/page/93 93\u20134] |url=https://archive.org/details/whoswhoingolf00elli/page/93 }}</ref> \u2013 attributes that earned him the nickname \"[[:wikt:bantam|Bantam]]\", which he thoroughly disliked \u2013 he was long off the tee early in his career. Like many professional golfers of his day, he competed in long drive contests as well as matchplay and strokeplay events.\n\nIt has been alleged that Hogan used a \"strong\" grip, with hands more the right of the club grip in tournament play prior to his accident in 1949, despite often practicing with a \"weak\" grip, with the back of the left wrist facing the target, and that this limited his success, or, at least, his reliability, up to that date.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fifty Greatest Golf Lessons of the Century |first=John |last=Jacobs |authorlink=John Jacobs (English golfer) |publisher=William Morrow |year=2000 |isbn=978-0062716149}}</ref> Jacobs alleges that [[Byron Nelson]] told him this information, and furthermore that Hogan developed and used the \"strong\" grip as a boy in order to be able to hit the ball as far as bigger, stronger contemporaries. This strong grip is what resulted in Hogan hitting the odd disastrous snap hook.\n\nHogan's late swing produced the famed \"Hogan Fade\" ball flight, lower than usual for a great player and from left to right. This ball flight was the result of his using a \"draw\" type swing in conjunction with a \"weak\" grip, a combination which all but negated the chance of hitting a hook.\n\nHogan played and practiced golf with only bare hands, i.e., he played or practiced without wearing gloves. [[Moe Norman]] did the same, playing and practicing without gloves. The two were arguably the greatest ball strikers golf has ever known; even [[Tiger Woods]] quoted them as the only players ever to have \"owned their swings\", in that they had total control of it and, as a result, the ball's flight.<ref name=\"GolfDigest\">''[[Golf Digest]]'', January 2005</ref>\n\nIn May 1967, the editor of [[Cary Middlecoff]]'s 1974 book ''The Golf Swing'' watched every shot that 54-year-old Hogan hit in the Colonial National Invitational in Fort Worth, Texas. \"Hogan shot 281 for a third-place tie with [[George Archer]]. Of the 281 shots, 141 were taken in reaching the greens. Of the 141, 139 were rated from well-executed to superbly executed. The remaining two were a drive that missed the fairway by some 5 yards and a 5-iron to a par-3 hole that missed the green by about the same distance. It was difficult, if not impossible to conceive of anybody hitting the ball better over a four-day span.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Golf Swing |url=https://archive.org/details/golfswing00midd |url-access=registration |last=Middlecoff |first=Cary |authorlink=Cary Middlecoff |editor-first=Tom |editor-last=Michael |page=[https://archive.org/details/golfswing00midd/page/32 32] |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1974 |asin=B000N6ZBEQ }}</ref>\n\n===Hogan's secret===\nHogan is thought to have developed a \"secret\" that made his swing nearly automatic. There are many theories as to its exact nature. The earliest theory is that the \"secret\" was a special wrist movement known as \"cupping under\". This information was revealed in a 1955 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article. However, many believed Hogan did not reveal all that he knew at the time. It has since been alleged in ''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine, and by Jody Vasquez in his book \"Afternoons With Mr Hogan\", that the second element of Hogan's \"secret\" was the way in which he used his right knee to initiate the swing and that this right knee movement was critical to the correct operation of the wrist.\n\nHogan revealed later in life that the \"secret\" involved cupping the left wrist at the top of the backswing and using a weaker left-hand grip (thumb more on top of the grip as opposed to on the right side).\n\nHogan did this to prevent himself from ever hooking the ball off the tee. By positioning his hands in this manner, he ensured that the club face would be slightly open upon impact, creating a fade (left to right ball flight) as opposed to a draw or hook (right to left ball flight).\n\n===Hand Dominance===\nMany believed that although he played right-handed as an adult, Hogan was actually left-handed. In his book \"Five Lessons,\" in the chapter entitled \"The Grip,\" Hogan said \"I was born left-handed -- that was the normal way for me to do things. I was switched over to doing things right-handed when I was a boy but I started golf as a left-hander because the first club I ever came into possession of, an old five-iron, was a left-handed stick.\" This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book \"Power Golf.\" However, some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of his being left-handed was actually a myth (noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 ''Golf Magazine'' interview).\n\nIn these interviews Hogan said that he was indeed a right-handed player who early on practiced/played with a left hand club that had been given to him because it was all that he had and that it was this issue that brought about the myth that he was left-handed. This may be the reason that his early play with right-handed equipment found him using a cross-handed grip (right hand at the end of the club, left hand below it). In \"The Search for the Perfect Golf Swing\", researchers Cochran and Stobbs held the opinion that a left-handed person playing right-handed would be prone to hook the ball.\n\n===Famous 1-iron shot===\n[[Hy Peskin]], a staff photographer for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', took a famous photo of Ben Hogan playing a 1-iron shot to the green at the 72nd hole of the [[1950 U.S. Open (golf)|1950 U.S. Open]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Politi |first=Steve |title=Ben Hogan made U.S. Open history with the 1 iron, but the club has vanished from golf |url=http://www.nj.com/golf/index.ssf/2013/06/ben_hogan_made_us_open_history.html |publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC |accessdate=October 29, 2015 }}</ref> It was ranked by ''Sports Illustrated'' as one of the greatest sports photographs of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wanke |first=Michele |title=Sports Illustrated Photo Pioneers |url=http://photography.lovetoknow.com/Sports_Illustrated_Photographers |publisher=LoveToKnow |accessdate=October 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==\"Five Lessons\" and golf instruction==\nHogan believed that a solid, repeatable golf swing involved only a few essential elements, which, when performed correctly and in sequence, were the essence of the swing. His book ''Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf'' (written with [[Herbert Warren Wind]]) is perhaps the most widely read golf tutorial ever written, although [[Harvey Penick]]'s ''Little Red Book'' would also have a claim to that title, and the principles therein are often parroted by modern \"swing gurus\". In the ''Five Lessons'', Hogan breaks down the swing into four parts: The Fundamentals, The Grip, Stance and Posture, and The Swing.\n\n===\"The Fundamentals\"===\nHogan explains that the average golfer underestimates himself.  He believes that beginners place too much emphasis on the long game. If you have a correct, powerful and repeating swing, then you can shoot in the 70s. \"The average golfer is entirely capable of building a repeating swing and breaking 80.\"<ref name=five>{{cite book |last=Hogan |first=Ben |title=Ben Hogan's Five Lessons |year=1957 |publisher=Fireside |isbn=0-671-61297-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/fivelessonsmode000hoga }}</ref>  Through years of trial and error, Ben has developed techniques that have proved themselves under various types of pressure.\n\n===\"The Grip\"===\nHogan says, \"Good golf begins with a good grip.\"<ref name=five/>  Without a good grip, one cannot play to his or her potential.  The grip is important because it is the only direct physical contact you have with the ball via your golf club.  A bad grip can cause dipping of the hands at the top of the swing and a decrease in club head speed.  This can cause a loss of power and accuracy. The following describes the perfect golf grip in the eyes of Mr. Hogan:\n[[File:GolfGripC-1024x677.jpg|thumb|GolfGripC-1024x677]]\n\"With the back of your left hand facing the target, place the club in the left hand so that, 1) The shaft is pressed up under the muscular pad at the inside heel of the palm, and 2) The shaft also lies directly across the top joint of the forefinger\".<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Crook the forefinger around the shaft and you will discover that you can lift the club and maintain a fairly firm grip on it by supporting it just with the muscles of that finger and the muscles of the pad of the palm.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Now just close the left hand-close the fingers before you close the thumb-and the club will be just where it should be.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"To gain a real acquaintance with this preparatory guide to correct gripping, I would suggest practicing it five or 10 minutes a day for a week until it begins to become second nature.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"To obtain the proper grip with the right hand, hold it somewhat extended, with the palm facing your target. Now-your left hand is already correctly affixed-place the club in your right hand so that the shaft lies across the top joint of the four fingers and definitely below the palm.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"The right hand is a finger grip.  The two fingers which should apply most of the pressure are the two middle fingers.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Now with the club held firmly on the fingers of your right hand, simply fold your right hand over your left thumb.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n===\"Stance and Posture\"===\nThe right stance not only allows for proper alignment, but also for a balanced swing, prepared usage of the proper muscles, and the maximum strength and control over your swing.  We align our body to the target only after we have aligned the club head to the target. [[File:Hogan-BallPosition.jpg|thumb|Hogan's Ball Positioning and Stance depending on the club selection.]]\nA proper stance starts with your feet being aligned at the target, followed by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target.  As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability.  Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club.  Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line.  The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing.  Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.\n\n\"The elbows should be tucked in, not stuck out from the body.  At address, the left elbow should point directly at the left hipbone and the right elbow should point directly at the right hipbone.  Furthermore, there should be a sense of fixed jointness between the two forearms and the wrists, and it should be maintained throughout the swing.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"You should bend your knees from the thighs down.  As your knees bend, the upper part of the trunk remains normally erect, just as it does when you sit down in a chair. In golf, the sit-down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator-sports-stick.  Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n===\"The Swing\"===\n\n====\"The Backswing\"====\nMr. Hogan advocates the use of a waggle not only because it helps you loosen your muscles, but also because it allows for your hands and arms to remember where to go for the first part of your backswing. The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass.  The \"glass\" has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball. Also, the backswing should be slightly steeper than the downswing.  At the top of your backswing, your back should be facing the target.\n\n[[File:Ravielli swing lg.gif|thumb|The Hogan Backswing comparing the angle of the hips to the angle of the shoulders.]]\n\"On the backswing, the order of movement goes like this: hands, arms, shoulders, hips.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Actually, the hands start the club head back a split second before the arms start back.  And the arms begin their movement a split second before the shoulders begin to turn.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Just before your hands reach hip level, the shoulders, as they turn, automatically start pulling the hips around.   As the hips begin to turn, they pull the left leg in to the right.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"When you have turned your shoulders all the way, your back should face squarely toward your target.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"When you finish your backswing, your chin should be hitting against the top of your left shoulder.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"As you begin the backswing, you must restrain your hips from moving until the turning of the shoulders starts to pull the hips around\u2026It is this increased tension that unwinds the upper part of the body.  It unwinds the shoulder, the arms and the hands in that order, the correct order.  It helps the swing so much it makes it almost automatic.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"If he executes his backswing properly, as his arms are approaching hip level, they should be parallel with the plane and they should remain parallel with the plane, just beneath the glass, till they reach the top of the backswing.  At the top of his backswing, his left arm should be extended at the exact same angle (to the ball) as the glass.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n====\"The Downswing\"====\nBen believes the second part of the swing, the downswing, is initiated by the hips starting to turn.  A baseball player throws a ball by transferring his weight and rotates his hips.  Then his shoulders and arm follow after.  Hogan thinks that the downswing is very similar to this action.  The downswing is at a slightly shallower angle and therefore the arms and hands should come from the inside-out on the downswing.  The club head reaches its maximum speed, not at impact, but right after, when both arms are fully extended.\n\n[[File:FofH-HoganGlassPlane.jpg|thumb|FofH-HoganGlassPlane]]\n\n\"At impact the back of the left hand faces toward your target.  The wrist bone is definitely raised.  It points to the target and, at the moment the ball is contacted, it is out in front, nearer to the target than any part of the hand.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"At impact the right arm is still bent slightly.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"At that point just beyond impact where both arms are straight and extended the club head reaches its maximum speed.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"The hips lead the shoulders all the way on the downswing.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n''The Five Lessons'' were initially released as a five-part series in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine, beginning with the issue of March 11, 1957.<ref name=simr57>{{cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42530/11 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Hogan |first=Ben |title=The modern fundamentals of golf: the grip |date=March 11, 1957 |page=8<!--|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101941/http://www.si.com/vault/cover/1957/03/11 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= -->}}</ref> It was compiled and printed in book form later that year and is currently in its 64th printing. Even today it continues to maintain a place at or near the top of the Amazon.com golf book sales rankings. The book was co-authored by [[Herbert Warren Wind]], and illustrated by artist Anthony Ravielli.\n\n==Playing style==\nHogan is widely acknowledged to have been one of the finest ball strikers that ever played the game.\n\nHogan's ball striking has also been described as being of near miraculous caliber by other very knowledgeable observers such as [[Jack Nicklaus]], who only saw him play some years after his prime. Nicklaus once responded to the question, \"Is [[Tiger Woods]] the best ball striker you have ever seen?\" with, \"No, no - Ben Hogan, easily\".<ref>''[[Golf Digest]]'', April 2004</ref>\n\nFurther testimony to Hogan's (and Moe Norman's) status among top golfers is provided by [[Tiger Woods]], who recently{{when}} said that he wished to \"own his (golf) swing\" in the same way as [[Moe Norman]] and Hogan had. Woods claimed that this pair were the only players ever to have \"owned their swings\", in that they had total control of it and, as a result, of the ball's flight.<ref name=\"GolfDigest\" />\n\nBy most accounts, Ben Hogan was the best golfer of his era and still stands as one of the greatest of all time. \"The Hawk\" possessed fierce determination and an iron will, which combined with his unquestionable golf skills, formed an aura which could intimidate opponents into competitive submission. In [[Scotland]], Hogan was known as \"The Wee Ice Man\", or, in some versions, \"Wee Ice Mon,\" a moniker earned during his famous [[The Open Championship|British Open]] victory at [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]] in 1953.<ref name=\"The Open\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx#player=Ben+HOGAN |title=1953 Ben Hogan |publisher=The Open |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016164928/http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx |archivedate=October 16, 2013 }}</ref> It is a reference to his steely and seemingly nerveless demeanor, itself a product of a golf swing he had built that was designed to perform better the more pressure he put it under. Hogan rarely spoke during competition, and mostly kept to himself. Hogan was also highly respected by fellow competitors for his superb course management skills. During his peak years, he rarely if ever attempted a shot in competition which he had not thoroughly honed in practice.\n\nAlthough his ball striking was perhaps the greatest ever, Hogan's putting skills are thought to have been below average, though he was capable of putting very well. Solid and sometimes spectacular in his early and peak years, Hogan by his later years deteriorated to the point of being an often poor putter by professional standards, particularly on slow [[Golf course#Putting green|greens]]. The majority of his putting problems developed after his 1949 car accident, which nearly blinded his left eye and impaired his depth perception.  Toward the end of his career, he often stood over the ball inordinately long before drawing his putter back.\n\nWhile he suffered from the \"[[yips]]\" in his later years,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-golf-att13-2009mar13,0,1378425.story |first=James |last=Wagner |title=Are the yips more than something in the head? |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 13, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317133501/http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-golf-att13-2009mar13%2C0%2C1378425.story |archivedate=March 17, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hogan was known as an effective putter from mid to short range on quick, U.S. Open style surfaces at times during his career.\n\n==Career and records==\nBen Hogan won ten tournaments in 1948 alone, including the [[1948 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at [[Riviera Country Club]], a course known as \"Hogan's Alley\" because of his success there. His 8-under par score in 1948 set a U.S. Open record that was matched only by Jack Nicklaus in [[1980 U.S. Open (golf)|1980]], Hale Irwin in [[1990 U.S. Open (golf)|1990]], and Lee Janzen in [[1993 U.S. Open (golf)|1993]]. It was not broken until Tiger Woods shot {{nowrap|12-under}} par in [[2000 U.S. Open (golf)|2000]] (Jim Furyk also shot {{nowrap|8-under}} par in the [[2003 U.S. Open (golf)|2003]], Rory McIlroy set the current record with 16-under par in [[2011 U.S. Open (golf)|2011]], which was matched by Brooks Koepka in [[2017 U.S. Open (golf)|2017]]).\n\n[[Colonial Country Club (Fort Worth)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Fort Worth]], a modern [[PGA Tour]] tournament venue, is also known as \"Hogan's Alley\" and may have the better claim to the nickname as he won its [[Fort Worth Invitational|tour event]] [[Fort Worth Invitational#Multiple winners|five times]]. It was his home course after his retirement, and he was an active member of Colonial as well for many years. The sixth hole at [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]], a par five on which Hogan took a famously difficult line off the tee during each of his rounds in the [[1953 Open Championship]], has also recently been renamed Hogan's Alley.\n\nPrior to the 1949 accident, Hogan never truly captured the hearts of his galleries, despite being one of the best golfers of his time. Perhaps this was due to his perceived cold and aloof on-course persona. But when Hogan shocked and amazed the golf world by returning to tournament golf only eleven months after his accident, and took second place in the 1950 [[Los Angeles Open]] after a playoff loss to [[Sam Snead]], he was cheered on by ecstatic fans. \"His legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer,\" famed [[sportswriter]] [[Grantland Rice]] said of Hogan's near-miss. However, he proved to his critics (and to himself, especially) that he could still win by completing his famous comeback five months later, defeating [[Lloyd Mangrum]] and [[George Fazio]] in an 18-hole playoff at [[Merion Golf Club|Merion]] near [[Philadelphia]] to win his second [[1950 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] title.\n\nHogan went on to achieve what is perhaps the greatest sporting accomplishment in history, limping to twelve more PGA Tour wins (including six [[men's major golf championships|majors]]) before retiring. In 1951, Hogan entered just five events, but won three of them - the [[1951 Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[1951 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and [[World Championship of Golf]], and finished second and fourth in his other two starts. He finished fourth on that season's money list, barely $6,000 behind the season's official money list leader [[Lloyd Mangrum]], who played over twenty events. That year also saw the release of a biopic starring [[Glenn Ford]] as Hogan, called ''[[Follow the Sun (film)|Follow the Sun: The Ben Hogan Story]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043550/ Follow the Sun] - Internet Movie Database</ref> He even received a [[ticker-tape parade]] in [[New York City]] in 1953, upon his return from winning the [[1953 Open Championship|British Open]], the only time he played the event. With that victory, Hogan became just the second player, after [[Gene Sarazen]], to win all four of the modern major championships\u2014the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship.\n\nHogan remains the only player to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same calendar year (1953). His 14-under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for a dozen years; as of 2018, he remains one of just twelve (Jack Nicklaus, [[Raymond Floyd]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], Tiger Woods, [[David Duval]], [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Charl Schwartzel]], [[Jordan Spieth]], [[Justin Rose]], [[Rickie Fowler]], and [[Patrick Reed]]) to have recorded such a low score in the tournament. In 1967, at age 54, Hogan shot a record 30 on the back nine at the Masters; the record stood until 1992.\n\nIn 1945, Hogan set a PGA Tour record for a 72-hole event at the [[Portland Open Invitational]] by shooting 27-under-par. The record stood until 1998, when it was broken by [[John Huston (golfer)|John Huston]] (it has since been surpassed by nine others, including most recently [[Phil Mickelson]]'s 28-under in the 2013 [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]]).<ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Brent |title=PGA Tour Scoring Record \u2013 Most Strokes Under Par Over 72 Holes |url=http://golf.about.com/od/progolftours/qt/pgascoring72par.htm |publisher=About.com| accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHogan never competed on the [[Senior PGA Tour]], as that circuit did not exist until he was in his late sixties.\n\n==Five U.S. Opens?==\nMany supporters of Hogan and some golf historians feel that his victory at the [[Hale America Open]] in 1942 should be counted as his fifth [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and 10th [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]], since the tournament was to be a substitute for the Open after its cancellation by the [[USGA]]. The Hale America Open was held in the same time slot and was run like the U.S. Open with more than 1,500 entries, local qualifying at 69 sites and sectional qualifying at most major cities.

(This line was used by subsequent Ryder Cup captain [[Raymond Floyd]] in 1989.  In 1989, playing at The Belfry, the two sides halved at 14 points each and Team Europe retained the cup.)\n*Hogan won the [[Vardon Trophy]] for lowest scoring average three times: 1940, 1941, and 1948. In 1953, Hogan won the [[Hickok Belt]] as the top professional athlete of the year in the United States.\n*The Ben Hogan Award is given annually by the Golf Writers Association of America to a golfer who has stayed active in golf despite a physical handicap or serious illness. The first winner was [[Babe Zaharias]].\n*The [[Ben Hogan Award (FOG)|Ben Hogan Award]] is given by Friends of Golf and the Golf Coaches Association of America to the best college golf player since 1990.\n*He was inducted into the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] in 1974.

Production began in the summer of 1954, with clubs targeted toward \"the better player.\" Always a perfectionist, Hogan is said to have ordered the entire first production run of clubs destroyed because they did not meet his exacting standards.\n\nIn 1960, he sold the company to [[American Machine and Foundry]] (AMF), but stayed on as chairman of the board for several more years. AMF ''Ben Hogan'' golf clubs were sold continuously from 1960 to 1985 when AMF was bought by Minstar who sold The Ben Hogan company in 1988 to Cosmo World, who owned the club manufacturer until 1992, when it was sold to another independent investor, Bill Goodwin.\n\nGoodwin moved the company out of Fort Worth, and a union shop, to Virginia so it would be close to his home of operations for other AMF brands and, incidentally, a non-union shop in an effort to return the company to profitability. Goodwin sold to Spalding in 1997, closing the sale in January 1998. Spalding returned manufacturing to Hogan's Fort Worth before eventually including the company's assets in a bankruptcy sale of Spalding's Top Flite division to Callaway in 2004. Callaway now owns the rights to the Ben Hogan brand. After over a half century and numerous ownership changes, the Ben Hogan line was discontinued by [[Callaway Golf Company|Callaway]] in 2008. In May 2014, Eldolon Brands approached Perry Ellis International and got the rights to use Ben Hogan's name for a line of golf clubs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2014/05/20/ben-hogan-golf-clubs-terry-koehler.html |title=Return of a legendary brand |publisher=PGA Tour |first=Jonathan |last=Wall |date=May 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHZwFr1cCFM |title=Essentials: The Top 10 Things to Know About Ben Hogan |publisher=[[PGA Tour]]|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ownership timeline===\n* 1953 \u2013 company founded\n* 1960 \u2013 sold to [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]], Hogan retained as president\n* 1984 \u2013 sold to Irwin Jacobs for $15 million\n* 1988 \u2013 sold to Cosmo World of [[Japan]] for $55 million, initial sponsor of the [[Ben Hogan Tour]] from 1990 to 1992\n* 1992 \u2013 sold to Bill Goodwin of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]\n* 1997 \u2013 sold to [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] Top-Flite<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/sportsbusiness/s/2003/0812/1594598.html |work=ESPN |title=Legendary brand will soon have new owner - again |first=Darren |last=Rovell |date=August 12, 2003 |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>\n* 2003 \u2013 sold to [[Callaway Golf Company|Callaway Golf]], Hogan line discontinued in 2008\n* 2014 - name licensed by Eldolon for a revived Ben Hogan line.

He is one of only five players to have won all four majors: the [[Masters Tournament]], [[The Open Championship|The Open]] (despite only playing once), the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and the [[PGA Championship]]. The other four are Nicklaus, Woods, Player, and [[Gene Sarazen]]; Hogan's [[1946 PGA Championship|first major win]] came at age&nbsp;34.\n\n==Early life and character==\nHogan was born in [[Stephenville, Texas]], the third and youngest child of Chester and Clara (Williams) Hogan. His father was a [[blacksmith]] and the family lived {{convert|10|mi|spell=in}} southwest in [[Dublin, Texas|Dublin]] until 1921, when they moved {{convert|70|mi|spell=in}} northeast to [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed [[suicide]] with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years.<ref>{{ cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2004/nf20040618_7190_db028.htm |title=The Hard Life of a Golfing Great |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=June 18, 2004 |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308013656/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2004/nf20040618_7190_db028.htm |archivedate=March 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their [[seamstress]] mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold [[newspaper]]s after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to [[caddying]] at age eleven at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course {{convert|7|mi|spell=in}} to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was [[Byron Nelson]], later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were fifteen. Nelson sank a {{convert|30|ft|0|adj=on}} putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]], they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke.\n\nThe following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz.\n\n==Turns professional==\nHogan dropped out of [[R. L. Paschal High School|Central High School]] during the final semester of his senior year. He turned pro in the golf industry six months shy of his 18th birthday at the Texas Open in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], in late January 1930. Hogan met Valerie Fox in Sunday school in Fort Worth in the mid-1920s, and they reacquainted in 1932 when he landed a low-paying club pro job in [[Cleburne, Texas|Cleburne]], where her family had moved. They married in April 1935 at her parents' home.\n\nHogan's early years as a pro were very difficult; he went broke more than once.

He worked at Century as an assistant and then as the head pro until 1941, when he took the head pro job at [[Hershey Country Club]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Career-threatening accident==\nDuring Hogan's prime years of 1938 through 1959, he won 63 professional golf tournaments despite the interruption of his career by [[World War II]] and a near-fatal car accident. Hogan served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] from March 1943 to June 1945; he was stationed locally at Fort Worth and became a utility pilot with the rank of [[First lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|lieutenant]].\n\nDriving home to Fort Worth after a Monday playoff loss at the 1949 [[Phoenix Open]],<ref name=dbhogpo>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ChkSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zvADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673%2C126486 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=United Press |title=Demaret beats Hogan for title |date=February 1, 1949 |page=10}}</ref> Hogan and his wife Valerie survived a head-on collision with a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus east of [[Van Horn, Texas]].

His doctors said he might never walk again, let alone play golf competitively. While Hogan was in the hospital in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], his life was endangered by a blood clot problem that led doctors to tie off the [[vena cava]].

He returned to the PGA Tour to start the 1950 season at the [[Los Angeles Open]], where he tied with [[Sam Snead]] over 72 holes, but lost the 18-hole playoff, held over a week later (due to course conditions).<ref name=snposet>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hSdQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=twsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6835%2C5444976 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=United Press |title=Hogan, Snead playoff set for next Tuesday |date=January 12, 1950 |page=23A}}</ref><ref name=smysndpo>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jCdQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=twsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6872%2C6155368 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=United Press |title=Sammy Snead tops Ben Hogan easily |date=January 19, 1950 |page=14A}}</ref>\n\n==The \"Triple Crown\" season==\nThe win at Carnoustie was only a part of Hogan's watershed 1953 season, a year in which he won five of the six tournaments he entered, including three [[men's major golf championships|major championships]] (a feat known as the [[Triple Crown (golf)|Triple Crown of Golf]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.augusta.com/masters/story/history/year-failures-led-ben-hogans-triple-crown-1953 |title=Ben Hogan's Triple Crown |publisher=The Augusta Chronicle |date=February 15, 2013 |accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt still stands among the greatest single seasons in the history of professional golf. Hogan, 40, was unable to enter\u2014and possibly win\u2014the 1953 [[PGA Championship]] (to complete the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]]) because its play (July 1\u20137) overlapped the play of The Open at Carnoustie (July 6\u201310), which he won. It was the only time that a golfer had won three major professional championships in a year until [[Tiger Woods]] won the final three majors in 2000 (and the first in 2001).\n\nHogan often declined to play in the PGA Championship; he skipped it more and more often as his career wore on. There were two reasons for this. First, the PGA Championship was, until 1958, a [[match play]] event, and Hogan's particular skill was \"shooting a number\"\u2014meticulously planning and executing a strategy to achieve a score for a round on a particular course (even to the point of leaving out the 7-iron in the U.S. Open at [[Merion Golf Club|Merion]], saying \"there are no 7-iron shots at Merion\"). Second, the PGA required several days of 36 holes per day competition, and after his 1949 auto accident, Hogan struggled to manage more than 18 holes a day.\n\nAfter the win at Carnoustie, Hogan and his wife Valerie were passengers on the SS ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' westbound to [[New York City]], where he received a [[List of ticker-tape parades in New York City|ticker tape parade]] down [[Broadway (Manhattan)#Nicknamed sections|Broadway]] on July&nbsp;21.<ref name=whittp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hCFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=suIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6983%2C4536275 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=United Press |title=150,000 welcome Hogan in ticker-tape parade |date=July 22, 1953 |page=2B}}</ref><ref name=welcthaw>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZDFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5076%2C7994228 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |last=Grimsley |first=Will |title=New York welcome thaws Ben Hogan |date=July 22, 1953 |page=13}}</ref>\n\n==Hogan's golf swing==\nBen Hogan is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest ball strikers who ever played golf. Although he had a formidable record with 64 PGA tour victories, it is Hogan's ball-striking ability that mostly underpins his modern reputation.\n\nHogan was known to practice more than any of his contemporary golfers and is said to have \"invented practice\". On this matter, Hogan himself said, \"You hear stories about me beating my brains out practicing, but... I was enjoying myself. I couldn't wait to get up in the morning, so I could hit balls. When I'm hitting the ball where I want, hard and crisply, it's a joy that very few people experience.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Apfelbaum |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn=978-1-60239-014-0}}</ref> He was also one of the first players to match particular clubs to yardages, or reference points around the course such as bunkers or trees, in order to improve his distance control.\n\nHogan thought that an individual's golf swing was \"in the dirt\" and that mastering it required plenty of practice and repetition. He is also known to have spent years contemplating the golf swing, trying a range of theories and methods before arriving at the finished method which brought him his greatest period of success.\n\nThe young Hogan was badly afflicted by hooking the golf ball. Although slight of build at 5'8\u00bd\" and 145 pounds<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Len |first2=Barbara |last2=Kelly |title=Who's Who in Golf |year=1976 |publisher=Arlington House |location=New Rochelle, New York |isbn=0-87000-225-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/whoswhoingolf00elli/page/93 93\u20134] |url=https://archive.org/details/whoswhoingolf00elli/page/93 }}</ref> \u2013 attributes that earned him the nickname \"[[:wikt:bantam|Bantam]]\", which he thoroughly disliked \u2013 he was long off the tee early in his career. Like many professional golfers of his day, he competed in long drive contests as well as matchplay and strokeplay events.\n\nIt has been alleged that Hogan used a \"strong\" grip, with hands more the right of the club grip in tournament play prior to his accident in 1949, despite often practicing with a \"weak\" grip, with the back of the left wrist facing the target, and that this limited his success, or, at least, his reliability, up to that date.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fifty Greatest Golf Lessons of the Century |first=John |last=Jacobs |authorlink=John Jacobs (English golfer) |publisher=William Morrow |year=2000 |isbn=978-0062716149}}</ref> Jacobs alleges that [[Byron Nelson]] told him this information, and furthermore that Hogan developed and used the \"strong\" grip as a boy in order to be able to hit the ball as far as bigger, stronger contemporaries. This strong grip is what resulted in Hogan hitting the odd disastrous snap hook.\n\nHogan's late swing produced the famed \"Hogan Fade\" ball flight, lower than usual for a great player and from left to right. This ball flight was the result of his using a \"draw\" type swing in conjunction with a \"weak\" grip, a combination which all but negated the chance of hitting a hook.\n\nHogan played and practiced golf with only bare hands, i.e., he played or practiced without wearing gloves. [[Moe Norman]] did the same, playing and practicing without gloves. The two were arguably the greatest ball strikers golf has ever known; even [[Tiger Woods]] quoted them as the only players ever to have \"owned their swings\", in that they had total control of it and, as a result, the ball's flight.<ref name=\"GolfDigest\">''[[Golf Digest]]'', January 2005</ref>\n\nIn May 1967, the editor of [[Cary Middlecoff]]'s 1974 book ''The Golf Swing'' watched every shot that 54-year-old Hogan hit in the Colonial National Invitational in Fort Worth, Texas. \"Hogan shot 281 for a third-place tie with [[George Archer]]. Of the 281 shots, 141 were taken in reaching the greens. Of the 141, 139 were rated from well-executed to superbly executed. The remaining two were a drive that missed the fairway by some 5 yards and a 5-iron to a par-3 hole that missed the green by about the same distance. It was difficult, if not impossible to conceive of anybody hitting the ball better over a four-day span.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Golf Swing |url=https://archive.org/details/golfswing00midd |url-access=registration |last=Middlecoff |first=Cary |authorlink=Cary Middlecoff |editor-first=Tom |editor-last=Michael |page=[https://archive.org/details/golfswing00midd/page/32 32] |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1974 |asin=B000N6ZBEQ }}</ref>\n\n===Hogan's secret===\nHogan is thought to have developed a \"secret\" that made his swing nearly automatic. There are many theories as to its exact nature. The earliest theory is that the \"secret\" was a special wrist movement known as \"cupping under\". This information was revealed in a 1955 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article. However, many believed Hogan did not reveal all that he knew at the time. It has since been alleged in ''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine, and by Jody Vasquez in his book \"Afternoons With Mr Hogan\", that the second element of Hogan's \"secret\" was the way in which he used his right knee to initiate the swing and that this right knee movement was critical to the correct operation of the wrist.\n\nHogan revealed later in life that the \"secret\" involved cupping the left wrist at the top of the backswing and using a weaker left-hand grip (thumb more on top of the grip as opposed to on the right side).\n\nHogan did this to prevent himself from ever hooking the ball off the tee. By positioning his hands in this manner, he ensured that the club face would be slightly open upon impact, creating a fade (left to right ball flight) as opposed to a draw or hook (right to left ball flight).\n\n===Hand Dominance===\nMany believed that although he played right-handed as an adult, Hogan was actually left-handed. In his book \"Five Lessons,\" in the chapter entitled \"The Grip,\" Hogan said \"I was born left-handed -- that was the normal way for me to do things. I was switched over to doing things right-handed when I was a boy but I started golf as a left-hander because the first club I ever came into possession of, an old five-iron, was a left-handed stick.\" This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book \"Power Golf.\" However, some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of his being left-handed was actually a myth (noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 ''Golf Magazine'' interview).\n\nIn these interviews Hogan said that he was indeed a right-handed player who early on practiced/played with a left hand club that had been given to him because it was all that he had and that it was this issue that brought about the myth that he was left-handed. This may be the reason that his early play with right-handed equipment found him using a cross-handed grip (right hand at the end of the club, left hand below it). In \"The Search for the Perfect Golf Swing\", researchers Cochran and Stobbs held the opinion that a left-handed person playing right-handed would be prone to hook the ball.\n\n===Famous 1-iron shot===\n[[Hy Peskin]], a staff photographer for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', took a famous photo of Ben Hogan playing a 1-iron shot to the green at the 72nd hole of the [[1950 U.S. Open (golf)|1950 U.S. Open]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Politi |first=Steve |title=Ben Hogan made U.S. Open history with the 1 iron, but the club has vanished from golf |url=http://www.nj.com/golf/index.ssf/2013/06/ben_hogan_made_us_open_history.html |publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC |accessdate=October 29, 2015 }}</ref> It was ranked by ''Sports Illustrated'' as one of the greatest sports photographs of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wanke |first=Michele |title=Sports Illustrated Photo Pioneers |url=http://photography.lovetoknow.com/Sports_Illustrated_Photographers |publisher=LoveToKnow |accessdate=October 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==\"Five Lessons\" and golf instruction==\nHogan believed that a solid, repeatable golf swing involved only a few essential elements, which, when performed correctly and in sequence, were the essence of the swing. His book ''Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf'' (written with [[Herbert Warren Wind]]) is perhaps the most widely read golf tutorial ever written, although [[Harvey Penick]]'s ''Little Red Book'' would also have a claim to that title, and the principles therein are often parroted by modern \"swing gurus\". In the ''Five Lessons'', Hogan breaks down the swing into four parts: The Fundamentals, The Grip, Stance and Posture, and The Swing.\n\n===\"The Fundamentals\"===\nHogan explains that the average golfer underestimates himself.  He believes that beginners place too much emphasis on the long game. If you have a correct, powerful and repeating swing, then you can shoot in the 70s. \"The average golfer is entirely capable of building a repeating swing and breaking 80.\"<ref name=five>{{cite book |last=Hogan |first=Ben |title=Ben Hogan's Five Lessons |year=1957 |publisher=Fireside |isbn=0-671-61297-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/fivelessonsmode000hoga }}</ref>  Through years of trial and error, Ben has developed techniques that have proved themselves under various types of pressure.\n\n===\"The Grip\"===\nHogan says, \"Good golf begins with a good grip.\"<ref name=five/>  Without a good grip, one cannot play to his or her potential.  The grip is important because it is the only direct physical contact you have with the ball via your golf club.  A bad grip can cause dipping of the hands at the top of the swing and a decrease in club head speed.  This can cause a loss of power and accuracy. The following describes the perfect golf grip in the eyes of Mr. Hogan:\n[[File:GolfGripC-1024x677.jpg|thumb|GolfGripC-1024x677]]\n\"With the back of your left hand facing the target, place the club in the left hand so that, 1) The shaft is pressed up under the muscular pad at the inside heel of the palm, and 2) The shaft also lies directly across the top joint of the forefinger\".<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Crook the forefinger around the shaft and you will discover that you can lift the club and maintain a fairly firm grip on it by supporting it just with the muscles of that finger and the muscles of the pad of the palm.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Now just close the left hand-close the fingers before you close the thumb-and the club will be just where it should be.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"To gain a real acquaintance with this preparatory guide to correct gripping, I would suggest practicing it five or 10 minutes a day for a week until it begins to become second nature.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"To obtain the proper grip with the right hand, hold it somewhat extended, with the palm facing your target. Now-your left hand is already correctly affixed-place the club in your right hand so that the shaft lies across the top joint of the four fingers and definitely below the palm.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"The right hand is a finger grip.  The two fingers which should apply most of the pressure are the two middle fingers.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Now with the club held firmly on the fingers of your right hand, simply fold your right hand over your left thumb.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n===\"Stance and Posture\"===\nThe right stance not only allows for proper alignment, but also for a balanced swing, prepared usage of the proper muscles, and the maximum strength and control over your swing.  We align our body to the target only after we have aligned the club head to the target. [[File:Hogan-BallPosition.jpg|thumb|Hogan's Ball Positioning and Stance depending on the club selection.]]\nA proper stance starts with your feet being aligned at the target, followed by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target.  As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability.  Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club.  Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line.  The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing.  Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.\n\n\"The elbows should be tucked in, not stuck out from the body.  At address, the left elbow should point directly at the left hipbone and the right elbow should point directly at the right hipbone.  Furthermore, there should be a sense of fixed jointness between the two forearms and the wrists, and it should be maintained throughout the swing.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"You should bend your knees from the thighs down.  As your knees bend, the upper part of the trunk remains normally erect, just as it does when you sit down in a chair. In golf, the sit-down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator-sports-stick.  Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n===\"The Swing\"===\n\n====\"The Backswing\"====\nMr. Hogan advocates the use of a waggle not only because it helps you loosen your muscles, but also because it allows for your hands and arms to remember where to go for the first part of your backswing. The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass.  The \"glass\" has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball. Also, the backswing should be slightly steeper than the downswing.  At the top of your backswing, your back should be facing the target.\n\n[[File:Ravielli swing lg.gif|thumb|The Hogan Backswing comparing the angle of the hips to the angle of the shoulders.]]\n\"On the backswing, the order of movement goes like this: hands, arms, shoulders, hips.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Actually, the hands start the club head back a split second before the arms start back.  And the arms begin their movement a split second before the shoulders begin to turn.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"Just before your hands reach hip level, the shoulders, as they turn, automatically start pulling the hips around.   As the hips begin to turn, they pull the left leg in to the right.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"When you have turned your shoulders all the way, your back should face squarely toward your target.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"When you finish your backswing, your chin should be hitting against the top of your left shoulder.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"As you begin the backswing, you must restrain your hips from moving until the turning of the shoulders starts to pull the hips around\u2026It is this increased tension that unwinds the upper part of the body.  It unwinds the shoulder, the arms and the hands in that order, the correct order.  It helps the swing so much it makes it almost automatic.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"If he executes his backswing properly, as his arms are approaching hip level, they should be parallel with the plane and they should remain parallel with the plane, just beneath the glass, till they reach the top of the backswing.  At the top of his backswing, his left arm should be extended at the exact same angle (to the ball) as the glass.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n====\"The Downswing\"====\nBen believes the second part of the swing, the downswing, is initiated by the hips starting to turn.  A baseball player throws a ball by transferring his weight and rotates his hips.  Then his shoulders and arm follow after.  Hogan thinks that the downswing is very similar to this action.  The downswing is at a slightly shallower angle and therefore the arms and hands should come from the inside-out on the downswing.  The club head reaches its maximum speed, not at impact, but right after, when both arms are fully extended.\n\n[[File:FofH-HoganGlassPlane.jpg|thumb|FofH-HoganGlassPlane]]\n\n\"At impact the back of the left hand faces toward your target.  The wrist bone is definitely raised.  It points to the target and, at the moment the ball is contacted, it is out in front, nearer to the target than any part of the hand.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"At impact the right arm is still bent slightly.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"At that point just beyond impact where both arms are straight and extended the club head reaches its maximum speed.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n\"The hips lead the shoulders all the way on the downswing.\"<ref name=five/>\n\n''The Five Lessons'' were initially released as a five-part series in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine, beginning with the issue of March 11, 1957.<ref name=simr57>{{cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42530/11 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Hogan |first=Ben |title=The modern fundamentals of golf: the grip |date=March 11, 1957 |page=8<!--|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101941/http://www.si.com/vault/cover/1957/03/11 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df= -->}}</ref> It was compiled and printed in book form later that year and is currently in its 64th printing. Even today it continues to maintain a place at or near the top of the Amazon.com golf book sales rankings. The book was co-authored by [[Herbert Warren Wind]], and illustrated by artist Anthony Ravielli.\n\n==Playing style==\nHogan is widely acknowledged to have been one of the finest ball strikers that ever played the game.\n\nHogan's ball striking has also been described as being of near miraculous caliber by other very knowledgeable observers such as [[Jack Nicklaus]], who only saw him play some years after his prime. Nicklaus once responded to the question, \"Is [[Tiger Woods]] the best ball striker you have ever seen?\" with, \"No, no - Ben Hogan, easily\".<ref>''[[Golf Digest]]'', April 2004</ref>\n\nFurther testimony to Hogan's (and Moe Norman's) status among top golfers is provided by [[Tiger Woods]], who recently{{when}} said that he wished to \"own his (golf) swing\" in the same way as [[Moe Norman]] and Hogan had. Woods claimed that this pair were the only players ever to have \"owned their swings\", in that they had total control of it and, as a result, of the ball's flight.<ref name=\"GolfDigest\" />\n\nBy most accounts, Ben Hogan was the best golfer of his era and still stands as one of the greatest of all time. \"The Hawk\" possessed fierce determination and an iron will, which combined with his unquestionable golf skills, formed an aura which could intimidate opponents into competitive submission. In [[Scotland]], Hogan was known as \"The Wee Ice Man\", or, in some versions, \"Wee Ice Mon,\" a moniker earned during his famous [[The Open Championship|British Open]] victory at [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]] in 1953.<ref name=\"The Open\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx#player=Ben+HOGAN |title=1953 Ben Hogan |publisher=The Open |accessdate=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016164928/http://www.theopen.com/en/History/OpenChampions.aspx |archivedate=October 16, 2013 }}</ref> It is a reference to his steely and seemingly nerveless demeanor, itself a product of a golf swing he had built that was designed to perform better the more pressure he put it under. Hogan rarely spoke during competition, and mostly kept to himself. Hogan was also highly respected by fellow competitors for his superb course management skills. During his peak years, he rarely if ever attempted a shot in competition which he had not thoroughly honed in practice.\n\nAlthough his ball striking was perhaps the greatest ever, Hogan's putting skills are thought to have been below average, though he was capable of putting very well. Solid and sometimes spectacular in his early and peak years, Hogan by his later years deteriorated to the point of being an often poor putter by professional standards, particularly on slow [[Golf course#Putting green|greens]]. The majority of his putting problems developed after his 1949 car accident, which nearly blinded his left eye and impaired his depth perception.  Toward the end of his career, he often stood over the ball inordinately long before drawing his putter back.\n\nWhile he suffered from the \"[[yips]]\" in his later years,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-golf-att13-2009mar13,0,1378425.story |first=James |last=Wagner |title=Are the yips more than something in the head? |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 13, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317133501/http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-golf-att13-2009mar13%2C0%2C1378425.story |archivedate=March 17, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hogan was known as an effective putter from mid to short range on quick, U.S. Open style surfaces at times during his career.\n\n==Career and records==\nBen Hogan won ten tournaments in 1948 alone, including the [[1948 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at [[Riviera Country Club]], a course known as \"Hogan's Alley\" because of his success there. His 8-under par score in 1948 set a U.S. Open record that was matched only by Jack Nicklaus in [[1980 U.S. Open (golf)|1980]], Hale Irwin in [[1990 U.S. Open (golf)|1990]], and Lee Janzen in [[1993 U.S. Open (golf)|1993]]. It was not broken until Tiger Woods shot {{nowrap|12-under}} par in [[2000 U.S. Open (golf)|2000]] (Jim Furyk also shot {{nowrap|8-under}} par in the [[2003 U.S. Open (golf)|2003]], Rory McIlroy set the current record with 16-under par in [[2011 U.S. Open (golf)|2011]], which was matched by Brooks Koepka in [[2017 U.S. Open (golf)|2017]]).\n\n[[Colonial Country Club (Fort Worth)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Fort Worth]], a modern [[PGA Tour]] tournament venue, is also known as \"Hogan's Alley\" and may have the better claim to the nickname as he won its [[Fort Worth Invitational|tour event]] [[Fort Worth Invitational#Multiple winners|five times]]. It was his home course after his retirement, and he was an active member of Colonial as well for many years. The sixth hole at [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]], a par five on which Hogan took a famously difficult line off the tee during each of his rounds in the [[1953 Open Championship]], has also recently been renamed Hogan's Alley.\n\nPrior to the 1949 accident, Hogan never truly captured the hearts of his galleries, despite being one of the best golfers of his time. Perhaps this was due to his perceived cold and aloof on-course persona. But when Hogan shocked and amazed the golf world by returning to tournament golf only eleven months after his accident, and took second place in the 1950 [[Los Angeles Open]] after a playoff loss to [[Sam Snead]], he was cheered on by ecstatic fans. \"His legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer,\" famed [[sportswriter]] [[Grantland Rice]] said of Hogan's near-miss. However, he proved to his critics (and to himself, especially) that he could still win by completing his famous comeback five months later, defeating [[Lloyd Mangrum]] and [[George Fazio]] in an 18-hole playoff at [[Merion Golf Club|Merion]] near [[Philadelphia]] to win his second [[1950 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] title.\n\nHogan went on to achieve what is perhaps the greatest sporting accomplishment in history, limping to twelve more PGA Tour wins (including six [[men's major golf championships|majors]]) before retiring. In 1951, Hogan entered just five events, but won three of them - the [[1951 Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[1951 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and [[World Championship of Golf]], and finished second and fourth in his other two starts. He finished fourth on that season's money list, barely $6,000 behind the season's official money list leader [[Lloyd Mangrum]], who played over twenty events. That year also saw the release of a biopic starring [[Glenn Ford]] as Hogan, called ''[[Follow the Sun (film)|Follow the Sun: The Ben Hogan Story]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043550/ Follow the Sun] - Internet Movie Database</ref> He even received a [[ticker-tape parade]] in [[New York City]] in 1953, upon his return from winning the [[1953 Open Championship|British Open]], the only time he played the event. With that victory, Hogan became just the second player, after [[Gene Sarazen]], to win all four of the modern major championships\u2014the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship.\n\nHogan remains the only player to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same calendar year (1953). His 14-under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for a dozen years; as of 2018, he remains one of just twelve (Jack Nicklaus, [[Raymond Floyd]], [[Ben Crenshaw]], Tiger Woods, [[David Duval]], [[Phil Mickelson]], [[Charl Schwartzel]], [[Jordan Spieth]], [[Justin Rose]], [[Rickie Fowler]], and [[Patrick Reed]]) to have recorded such a low score in the tournament. In 1967, at age 54, Hogan shot a record 30 on the back nine at the Masters; the record stood until 1992.\n\nIn 1945, Hogan set a PGA Tour record for a 72-hole event at the [[Portland Open Invitational]] by shooting 27-under-par. The record stood until 1998, when it was broken by [[John Huston (golfer)|John Huston]] (it has since been surpassed by nine others, including most recently [[Phil Mickelson]]'s 28-under in the 2013 [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]]).<ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Brent |title=PGA Tour Scoring Record \u2013 Most Strokes Under Par Over 72 Holes |url=http://golf.about.com/od/progolftours/qt/pgascoring72par.htm |publisher=About.com| accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHogan never competed on the [[Senior PGA Tour]], as that circuit did not exist until he was in his late sixties.\n\n==Five U.S. Opens?==\nMany supporters of Hogan and some golf historians feel that his victory at the [[Hale America Open]] in 1942 should be counted as his fifth [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] and 10th [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]], since the tournament was to be a substitute for the Open after its cancellation by the [[USGA]]. The Hale America Open was held in the same time slot and was run like the U.S. Open with more than 1,500 entries, local qualifying at 69 sites and sectional qualifying at most major cities.

(This line was used by subsequent Ryder Cup captain [[Raymond Floyd]] in 1989.  In 1989, playing at The Belfry, the two sides halved at 14 points each and Team Europe retained the cup.)\n*Hogan won the [[Vardon Trophy]] for lowest scoring average three times: 1940, 1941, and 1948. In 1953, Hogan won the [[Hickok Belt]] as the top professional athlete of the year in the United States.\n*The Ben Hogan Award is given annually by the Golf Writers Association of America to a golfer who has stayed active in golf despite a physical handicap or serious illness.

Production began in the summer of 1954, with clubs targeted toward \"the better player.\" Always a perfectionist, Hogan is said to have ordered the entire first production run of clubs destroyed because they did not meet his exacting standards.\n\nIn 1960, he sold the company to [[American Machine and Foundry]] (AMF), but stayed on as chairman of the board for several more years. AMF ''Ben Hogan'' golf clubs were sold continuously from 1960 to 1985 when AMF was bought by Minstar who sold The Ben Hogan company in 1988 to Cosmo World, who owned the club manufacturer until 1992, when it was sold to another independent investor, Bill Goodwin.\n\nGoodwin moved the company out of Fort Worth, and a union shop, to Virginia so it would be close to his home of operations for other AMF brands and, incidentally, a non-union shop in an effort to return the company to profitability. Goodwin sold to Spalding in 1997, closing the sale in January 1998. Spalding returned manufacturing to Hogan's Fort Worth before eventually including the company's assets in a bankruptcy sale of Spalding's Top Flite division to Callaway in 2004. Callaway now owns the rights to the Ben Hogan brand. After over a half century and numerous ownership changes, the Ben Hogan line was discontinued by [[Callaway Golf Company|Callaway]] in 2008.

It is usually ranked among the top three public universities in Japan, along with the [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto University]]. It is ranked third overall among Japanese universities and 71st worldwide in the 2020 [[QS World University Ranking]]s.\n\nThe Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] has classified Osaka University as a leading university in the [[Top Global University Project]].

The school was later designated the '''Osaka Prefectural Medical College''' with university status by the University Ordinance (Imperial Ordinance No. 388) in 1919. The Medical College merged with the newly founded College of Science to form '''Osaka Imperial University''' in 1931. Osaka Imperial University was the sixth [[National Seven Universities|imperial university]] in Japan. '''Osaka Technical College''' was incorporated to form the School of Engineering two years later. The entire university was renamed Osaka University in 1947.\n\nAfter merging with Naniwa High School and Osaka High School as a result of the government's education system reform in 1949, Osaka University started its postwar era with five faculties: Science, Medicine, Engineering, Letters, and Law. Since that time new faculties and research institutes have been established, including the first Japanese School of Engineering Science and the School of Human Sciences, which covers such cross-disciplinary research interests as broadly as psychology, sociology, and education. Built on the then-existing faculties, ten graduate schools were set up as part of the government's education system reform program in 1953. Two more graduate faculties were added in 1994.\n\nIn 1993, Osaka University Hospital was relocated from the [[Nakanoshima]] campus in downtown Osaka to the [[Suita]] campus, completing the implementation of the university's plan to integrate the scattered facilities into the Suita and [[Toyonaka]] campuses. In October 2007, a merger between Osaka University and the [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] in [[Minoh]] was completed. The merger made Osaka University one of two national universities in the country with a School of Foreign Studies, along with the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]]. The merger also made Osaka University the largest national university in Japan.\n\n==Campuses==\n[[File:Osaka university toyonaka main entrance.jpg|thumb|Toyonaka Campus Main Entrance]]\nSuita, Toyonaka, and Minoh are the contemporary university's three campuses. Home to the university's headquarters, the Suita campus extends across [[Suita|Suita City]] and [[Ibaraki, Osaka|Ibaraki City]] in Osaka Prefecture. The Suita campus houses faculties of Human Sciences, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Engineering. It contains the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences and a portion of the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology. The campus is also home to the Osaka University Hospital and the Nationwide Joint Institute of Cybermedia Center and Research Center for Nuclear Physics.\n\nThe Toyonaka campus is home to faculties of Letters, Law, Economics, Science, and Engineering Science. It is also the academic base for Graduate Schools of International Public Policy, Language and Culture, a portion of Information Science, and the Center for the Practice of Legal and Political Expertise. All undergraduates attend classes on the Toyonaka campus during their first year of enrollment. Sports activities are primarily concentrated on the Toyonaka campus, with the exception of tennis, which is located in Suita.\n\n[[File:Osaka Imperial University.jpg|thumb|Nakanoshima campus]]\nThe Minoh campus was incorporated following the merger with the [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] in October 2007. The Minoh campus is home to the School of Foreign Studies, the Research Institute for World Languages, and the Center for Japanese Language and Culture.\n\nIn addition to these three campuses, the former Nakanoshima campus, the university's earliest campus located in downtown Osaka, served as the hub for the faculty of medicine until the transfer to the Suita campus was completed in 1993.<ref>[http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/guide/about/history.html History of Osaka University \u2014 Osaka University].

The spirit of the university's humanities programs is believed to be intimately rooted in the history of the Kaitokud\u014d, whereas that of the natural and applied sciences is based upon the traditions of the Tekijuku.<ref>{{cite web | title = History of the University | publisher = Osaka University | url = http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/guide/about/history.html | accessdate = 2008-02-08}}</ref>\nOsaka University traces its modern origins back the founding of '''Osaka Prefectural Medical School''' in downtown [[Osaka City]] in 1869. The school was later designated the '''Osaka Prefectural Medical College''' with university status by the University Ordinance (Imperial Ordinance No. 388) in 1919. The Medical College merged with the newly founded College of Science to form '''Osaka Imperial University''' in 1931. Osaka Imperial University was the sixth [[National Seven Universities|imperial university]] in Japan. '''Osaka Technical College''' was incorporated to form the School of Engineering two years later. The entire university was renamed Osaka University in 1947.\n\nAfter merging with Naniwa High School and Osaka High School as a result of the government's education system reform in 1949, Osaka University started its postwar era with five faculties: Science, Medicine, Engineering, Letters, and Law. Since that time new faculties and research institutes have been established, including the first Japanese School of Engineering Science and the School of Human Sciences, which covers such cross-disciplinary research interests as broadly as psychology, sociology, and education. Built on the then-existing faculties, ten graduate schools were set up as part of the government's education system reform program in 1953. Two more graduate faculties were added in 1994.\n\nIn 1993, Osaka University Hospital was relocated from the [[Nakanoshima]] campus in downtown Osaka to the [[Suita]] campus, completing the implementation of the university's plan to integrate the scattered facilities into the Suita and [[Toyonaka]] campuses. In October 2007, a merger between Osaka University and the [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] in [[Minoh]] was completed. The merger made Osaka University one of two national universities in the country with a School of Foreign Studies, along with the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]]. The merger also made Osaka University the largest national university in Japan.\n\n==Campuses==\n[[File:Osaka university toyonaka main entrance.jpg|thumb|Toyonaka Campus Main Entrance]]\nSuita, Toyonaka, and Minoh are the contemporary university's three campuses. Home to the university's headquarters, the Suita campus extends across [[Suita|Suita City]] and [[Ibaraki, Osaka|Ibaraki City]] in Osaka Prefecture. The Suita campus houses faculties of Human Sciences, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Engineering. It contains the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences and a portion of the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology. The campus is also home to the Osaka University Hospital and the Nationwide Joint Institute of Cybermedia Center and Research Center for Nuclear Physics.\n\nThe Toyonaka campus is home to faculties of Letters, Law, Economics, Science, and Engineering Science. It is also the academic base for Graduate Schools of International Public Policy, Language and Culture, a portion of Information Science, and the Center for the Practice of Legal and Political Expertise. All undergraduates attend classes on the Toyonaka campus during their first year of enrollment. Sports activities are primarily concentrated on the Toyonaka campus, with the exception of tennis, which is located in Suita.\n\n[[File:Osaka Imperial University.jpg|thumb|Nakanoshima campus]]\nThe Minoh campus was incorporated following the merger with the [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] in October 2007. The Minoh campus is home to the School of Foreign Studies, the Research Institute for World Languages, and the Center for Japanese Language and Culture.\n\nIn addition to these three campuses, the former Nakanoshima campus, the university's earliest campus located in downtown Osaka, served as the hub for the faculty of medicine until the transfer to the Suita campus was completed in 1993.<ref>[http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/guide/about/history.html History of Osaka University \u2014 Osaka University].

Appearing on the film's soundtrack ''[[Mulan (soundtrack)|Mulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack]]'', \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by American singer [[Donny Osmond]] as the [[Playback singer|singing voice]] of [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Captain Li Shang]] in lieu of American actor [[BD Wong]], who provides the character's speaking voice. The song also features contributions from [[Lea Salonga]] as [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]], [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Mushu]], and [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Jerry Tondo]] and Wilder himself as [[Yao, Ling and Chien-Po|Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]], respectively. In addition, Mushu has a speaking line unlike the other characters in the song.\n\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written to replace the song \"We'll Make a Man of You\" after the film's original songwriter [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] departed from the project in favor of working on [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]]' ''[[The Prince of Egypt]] ''(1998). Wilder and Zippel were inspired to complete the song after conceiving its ironic title, and the initial draft of the track was immediately approved by Disney. Prior to ''Mulan'', Osmond had auditioned for the role of [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' (1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that he sounded too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up-tempo military-style song that incorporates both Eastern and Western musical styles, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Shang during a rigorous [[Montage (filmmaking)|training montage]] in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her, while its lyrics explore [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]] contradicted with Mulan's gender.\n\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" has received mostly positive reviews from film and music critics, some of whom dubbed it the film's best song, while praising Osmond's performance. Critics have also drawn comparisons between the song and Disney's ''Hercules'','' ''while likening Mulan's role and transformation to actress [[Demi Moore]]'s performance as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the film ''[[G. I. Jane]] ''(1997). The song has since appeared on several \"best of\" Disney songs lists, including those of ''[[Total Film]] ''and the'' [[New York Post]]''. Discussed by film critics, film historians, academic journalists and feminists, the song has gone on to be recorded and covered in several different languages\u2014namely Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish\u2014by entertainers [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Cristian Castro]], respectively.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written by composer [[Matthew Wilder]] and lyricist [[David Zippel]], who were hired to write ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''<nowiki/>'s songs because Disney was interested in recruiting songwriters \"that ... would give kind of different sound to each of the songs.\"<ref name=\":15\" /> While Zippel, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] lyricist, was recruited because the directors were impressed with his work on Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]] ''(1997), at the time Wilder, a [[pop music|pop]] singer, had been best known for his song \"[[Break My Stride]]\".<ref name=\":15\" /> Bancroft believes that, although the

continued building until \"it became this cacophonous effect of a Chinese marching American band\".<ref name=\":19\" /> Wilder and Zippel decided to incorporate drums into the track to demonstrate a

\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is \"a playful parody of conventional masculinity.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> ''[[USA Today]]''<nowiki/>'s Hannah Yasharoff described the song as \"a [[tongue-in-cheek]]

opportunity \"to have those two issues head-to-head.\"<ref name=\":19\" /> The lyric \"I'll make a man out of you\" is constantly repeated and reinforced by Shang.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to author John Stephens of ''Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature'', the song's lyrics \"initially define masculinity in opposition to femininity,\"<ref name=\":7\" /> with its first verse beginning, \"Let's get down to business/To defeat the Huns/Did they send me daughters/When I asked for sons?\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Its [[chorus (song)|chorus]] reads, \"You must be

Appearing on the film's soundtrack ''[[Mulan (soundtrack)|Mulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack]]'', \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by American singer [[Donny Osmond]] as the [[Playback singer|singing voice]] of [[Li Shang (Mulan character)|Captain Li Shang]] in lieu of American actor [[BD Wong]], who provides the character's speaking voice. The song also features contributions from [[Lea Salonga]] as [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]], [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Mushu]], and [[Harvey Fierstein]], [[Jerry Tondo]] and Wilder himself as [[Yao, Ling and Chien-Po|Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]], respectively. In addition, Mushu has a speaking line unlike the other characters in the song.\n\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written to replace the song \"We'll Make a Man of You\" after the film's original songwriter [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] departed from the project in favor of working on [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]]' ''[[The Prince of Egypt]] ''(1998). Wilder and Zippel were inspired to complete the song after conceiving its ironic title, and the initial draft of the track was immediately approved by Disney. Prior to ''Mulan'', Osmond had auditioned for the role of [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' (1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that he sounded too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up-tempo military-style song that incorporates both Eastern and Western musical styles, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Shang during a rigorous [[Montage (filmmaking)|training montage]] in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her, while its lyrics explore [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]] contradicted with Mulan's gender.\n\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" has received mostly positive reviews from film and music critics, some of whom dubbed it the film's best song, while praising Osmond's performance. Critics have also drawn comparisons between the song and Disney's ''Hercules'','' ''while likening Mulan's role and transformation to actress [[Demi Moore]]'s performance as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the film ''[[G. I. Jane]] ''(1997). The song has since appeared on several \"best of\" Disney songs lists, including those of ''[[Total Film]] ''and the'' [[New York Post]]''. Discussed by film critics, film historians, academic journalists and feminists, the song has gone on to be recorded and covered in several different languages\u2014namely Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish\u2014by entertainers [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Cristian Castro]], respectively.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written by composer [[Matthew Wilder]] and lyricist [[David Zippel]], who were hired to write ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''<nowiki/>'s songs because Disney was interested in recruiting songwriters \"that ... would give kind of different sound to each of the songs.\"<ref name=\":15\" /> While Zippel, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] lyricist, was recruited because the directors were impressed with his work on Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]] ''(1997), at the time Wilder, a [[pop music|pop]] singer, had been best known for his song \"[[Break My Stride]]\".<ref name=\":15\" /> Bancroft believes that, although the

piece was.\"<ref name=\":19\" /> Combining Eastern and Western styles, Wilder borrowed \"drum cadences from traditional Chinese drums and then marrying that with military snares\", upon which he continued building until \"it became this cacophonous effect of a Chinese marching American band\".<ref name=\":19\" /> Wilder and Zippel decided to incorporate drums into the track to demonstrate a

masculinity\" into the song's lyrics \u2013 raging fire, coursing river, great typhoon \u2013 was used in an attempt to \"get inside Shang's head space\", elaborating, \"I was just trying to be in

Mounted on an inside superstructure are about 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes that detect light from [[Cherenkov radiation]].

This creates a cone of light known as [[Cherenkov radiation]], which is the optical equivalent to a [[sonic boom]]. The Cherenkov light is projected as a ring on the wall of the detector and recorded by the PMTs. Using the timing and charge information recorded by each PMT, the interaction vertex, ring direction and flavor of the incoming neutrino is determined. From the sharpness of the edge of the ring the type of particle can be inferred. The [[scattering|multiple scattering]] of electrons is large, so electromagnetic showers produce fuzzy rings. Highly [[special relativity|relativistic]] [[muon]]s, in contrast, travel almost straight through the detector and produce rings with sharp edges.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Kamiokande89.JPG|thumb|right|A model of KamiokaNDE]]\nConstruction of the predecessor of the present [[Kamioka Observatory]], the [[Institute for Cosmic Ray Research]], [[University of Tokyo]] began in 1982 and was completed in April 1983.

The detector was upgraded, starting in 1985, to allow it to observe solar neutrinos. As a result, the detector (KamiokaNDE-II) had become sensitive enough to detect neutrinos from [[SN 1987A]], a [[supernova]] which was observed in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] in February 1987, and to observe solar neutrinos in 1988. The ability of the Kamiokande experiment to observe the direction of electrons produced in solar neutrino [[elastic scattering|interactions]] allowed experimenters to directly demonstrate for the first time that the sun was a source of neutrinos.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande project was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture in 1991 for total funding of approximately $100 M. The US portion of the proposal, which was primarily to build the OD system, was approved by the US Department of Energy in 1993 for $3 M. In addition the US has also contributed about 2000 20&nbsp;cm PMTs recycled from the [[Irvine\u2013Michigan\u2013Brookhaven (detector)|IMB experiment]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDespite successes in [[neutrino astronomy]] and neutrino astrophysics, Kamiokande did not achieve its primary goal, the detection of proton decay. Higher sensitivity was also necessary to obtain high statistical confidence in its results. This led to the construction of Super-Kamiokande, with fifteen times the water and ten times as many PMTs as Kamiokande. Super-Kamiokande started operation in 1996.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande Collaboration announced the first evidence of [[neutrino oscillation]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fukuda, Y. | display-authors = etal | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 81 | issue = 8 | pages = 1562\u20131567 | date = 1998 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1562 | title = Evidence for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos | arxiv = hep-ex/9807003 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.1562F }}</ref> This was the first experimental observation supporting the theory that the neutrino has non-zero [[mass]], a possibility that theorists had speculated about for years. The 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to Super-Kamiokande researcher [[Takaaki Kajita]] alongside [[Arthur B. McDonald|Arthur McDonald]] for their work on neutrino oscillations.\n\nOn 12 November 2001, about 6,600 of the photomultiplier tubes (costing about $3000 each<ref>{{cite web|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/accident-grounds-neutrino-lab/|title=Accident grounds neutrino lab|author=|date=|website=physicsworld.com}}</ref>) in the Super-Kamiokande detector [[Implosion (mechanical process)|imploded]], apparently in a [[chain reaction]] or [[cascading failure]], as the [[shock wave]] from the concussion of each imploding tube cracked its neighbours. The detector was partially restored by redistributing the photomultiplier tubes which did not implode, and by adding protective [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] shells that are hoped will prevent another chain reaction from recurring (Super-Kamiokande-II).\n\nIn July 2005, preparations began to restore the detector to its original form by reinstalling about 6,000 PMTs. The work was completed in June 2006, whereupon the detector was renamed Super-Kamiokande-III. This phase of the experiment collected data from October 2006 till August 2008. At that time, significant upgrades were made to the electronics. After the upgrade, the new phase of the experiment has been referred to as Super-Kamiokande-IV. SK-IV collected data on various natural sources of neutrinos, as well as acted as the far detector for the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.\n\nSK-IV continued until June 2018. After that, the detector underwent a full refurbishment during Autumn of 2018. On 29 January 2019 the detector resumed data-taking.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00440-2|pmid = 30728526| title=Neutrino hunt resumes, ITER's new confidence and Elsevier's woes| journal=Nature| volume=566| issue=7742| pages=12\u201313| year=2019| bibcode=2019Natur.566...12.}}</ref>\n\n==Detector==\nThe Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a Cherenkov detector used to study neutrinos from different sources including the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and accelerators. It is also used to search for proton decay. The experiment began in April 1996 and was shut down for maintenance in July 2001, a period known as \"SK-I\". Since an accident occurred during maintenance, the experiment resumed in October 2002 with only half of its original number of ID-PMTs.  In order to prevent further accidents, all of the ID-PMTs were covered by fiber-reinforced plastic with acrylic front windows. This phase from October 2002 to another closure for an entire reconstruction in October 2005 is called \"SK-II\". In July 2006, the experiment resumed with the full number of PMTs and stopped in September 2008 for electronics upgrades. This period was known as \"SK-III\". The period after 2008 is known as \"SK-IV\".

Beta decay in the Earth and in supernovas turns neutrons into protons with the emission of anti-neutrinos. The Super-Kamiokande detects electrons knocked off a water molecule producing a flash of blue Cherenkov light, and these are produced both by neutrinos and antineutrinos.  A rarer instance is when an antineutrino interacts with a proton in water to produce a neutron and a positron.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Castelvecchi|first=Davide|date=2019-02-27|title=Gigantic Japanese detector prepares to catch neutrinos from supernovae|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=566|issue=7745|pages=438\u2013439|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00598-9}}</ref>\n\nGadolinium has an affinity for neutrons and produces a bright flash of gamma rays when it absorbs one. Adding gadolinium to the Super-Kamiokande allows it to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Antineutrinos produce a double flash of light about 30 microseconds apart, first when the neutrino hits a proton and second when gadolinium absorbs a neutron.<ref name=\":0\" /> The brightness of the first flash allows physicists to distinguish between low energy antineutrinos from the Earth and high energy antineutrinos from supernovas. In addition to observing neutrinos from distant supernovas, the Super-Kamiokande will be able to set off an alarm to inform astronomers around the world of the presence of a supernova in the Milky Way within one second of it occurring.\n\nThe biggest challenge was whether the detector's water could be continuously filtered to remove impurities without removing the gadolinium at the same time. A 200-ton prototype called EGADS with added gadolinium sulfate was installed in the Kamioka mine and operated for years. It finished operation in 2018 and showed that the new water purification system would remove impurities while keeping the gadolinium concentration stable. It also showed that gadolinium sulfate would not significantly impair the transparency of the otherwise ultrapure water, or cause corrosion or deposition on existing equipment or on the new valves that will later be installed in the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Water tank===\nThe outer shell of the water tank is a cylindrical stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The tank is self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the tank is filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 ktons of water.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |volume=51 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |author1=S.

Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames are connected to each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected to the bottom of the tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, supermodules simplified the initial assembly of the ID. Each supermodule was assembled on the tank floor and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with supermodules. During installation, ID PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.[[File:The PMTs used in Super-Kamiokande.gif|thumb|right|Schematic view of a 50 cm PMT.]]\n\nCables from each group of 3 PMTs are bundled together. All cables run up the outer surface of the PMT support structure, i.e., on the OD PMT plane, pass through cable ports at the top of the tank, and are then routed into the electronics huts.\n\nThe thickness of the OD varies slightly, but is on average about 2.6 m on top and bottom, and 2.7 m on the barrel wall, giving the OD a total mass of 18 kilotons. OD PMTs were distributed with 302 on the top layer, 308 on the bottom, and 1275 on the barrel wall.\n\nTo protect against low energy background from radon decay products in the air, the roof of the cavity and the access tunnels were sealed with a coating called Mineguard. Mineguard is a spray-applied polyurethane membrane developed for use as a rock support system and radon gas barrier in the mining industry.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe average geomagnetic field is about 450 mG and is inclined by about 45\u00b0 with respect to the horizon at the detector site. This presents a problem for the large and very sensitive PMTs which prefer a much lower ambient field. The strength and uniform direction of the geomagnetic field could systematically bias photoelectron trajectories and timing in the PMTs. To counteract this 26 sets of horizontal and vertical Helmholtz coils are arranged around the inner surfaces of the tank. With these in operation the average field in the detector is reduced to about 50 mG. The magnetic field at various PMT locations were measured before the tank was filled with water.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nA standard fiducial volume of approximately 22.5 ktons is defined as the region inside a surface drawn 2.00 m from the ID wall to minimize the anomalous response causing by natural radioactivity in the surrounding rock.\n\n==Monitoring system==\n\n===Online monitoring system===\nAn online monitor computer located in the control room reads data from the DAQ host computer via an FDDI link. It provides shift operators with a flexible tool for selecting event display features, makes online and recent-history histograms to monitor detector performance, and performs a variety of additional tasks needed to efficiently monitor status and diagnose detector and DAQ problems. Events in the data stream can be skimmed off and elementary analysis tools can be applied to check data quality during calibrations or after changes in hardware or online software.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Realtime supernova monitor===\nTo detect and identify such bursts as efficiently and promptly as possible Super-Kamiokande is equipped with an online supernova monitor system. About 10,000 total events are expected in Super-Kamiokande for a supernova explosion at the center of our Galaxy. Super-Kamiokande can measure a burst with no dead-time, up to 30,000 events within the first second of a burst. Theoretical calculations of supernova explosions suggest that neutrinos are emitted over a total time-scale of tens of seconds with about a half of them emitted during the first one or two seconds. The Super-K will search for event clusters in specified time windows of 0.5, 2 and 10 s.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Data are transmitted to realtime SN-watch analysis process every 2 min and analysis is completed typically in 1 min. When supernova (SN) event candidates are found, <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is calculated if the event multiplicity is larger than 16, where <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is defined as the average spatial distance between events, i.e.\n\n<math>{R_\\text{mean}} =\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}} |{r_\\text{i}}-{r_\\text{j}}|} {{N_\\text{nulti}} {C_\\text{2}}}</math>\n\nNeutrinos from supernovae interact with free protons, producing positrons which are distributed so uniformly in the detector that <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> for SN events should be significantly larger than for ordinary spatial clusters of events. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, Rmean for uniformly distributed Monte Carlo events shows that no tail exists below <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7d1000&nbsp;cm. For the \u201calarm\u201d class of burst, the events are required to have <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e900&nbsp;cm for 25\u2a7d<math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>\u2a7d40 or <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e750&nbsp;cm for <math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>>40. These thresholds were determined by extrapolation from SN1987A data.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{Citation  |title = Observation of a neutrino burst from the supernova SN1987A  |author1 = Hirata, K |journal = Physical Review Letters  |volume = 58  |issue = 14  |pages = 1490\u20131493   |date=6 April 1987 |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.1490 |bibcode = 1987PhRvL..58.1490H |display-authors=etal |pmid=10034450}}</ref> The system will run special processes to check for spallation muons when burst candidates meeting \u201calarm\u201d criteria and make a primarily decision for further process. If the burst candidate passes these checks, the data will be reanalyzed using an offline process and a final decision will be made within a few hours. During the Super-Kamiokande I running, this never occurred.\nOne of the important capabilities for [Super-Kamiokande] is to reconstruct the direction to supernova. By neutrino\u2013electron scattering, <math>\\nu_\\text{x} + e^- \\to \\nu_\\text{x} + e^-</math>, a total of 100\u2013150 events are expected in case of a supernova at the center of our Galaxy.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The direction to supernova can be measured with angular resolution\n\n<math>\\delta \\theta \\sim {30^\\circ \\over \\sqrt{N}}</math>\n\nwhere N is the number of events produced by the \u03bd\u2013e scattering. The angular resolution, therefore, can be as good as \u03b4\u03b8\u223c3\u00b0 for a supernova at the center of our Galaxy.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this case, not only time profile and the energy spectrum of a neutrino burst, but also the information on direction of supernova can be provided.\n\n===Slow control monitor and offline process monitor===\nThere is a process called the \u201cslow control\u201d monitor, as part of the online monitoring system, watches the status of the HV systems, the temperatures of electronics crates and the status of the compensating coils used to cancel the geomagnetic field. When any deviation from norms is detected, it will alert physicists to prompt to investigate, take appropriate action, or notify experts.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nTo monitor and control the offline processes that analyze and transfer data, a set of software was sophisticatedly developed. This monitor allows non-expert shift physicists to identify and repair common problems to minimize down time, and the software package was a significant contribution to the smooth operation of the experiment and its overall high lifetime efficiency for data taking.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Research==\n\n===Solar neutrino===\n{{See also|Neutrino Oscillation}}\nThe energy of the Sun comes from the nuclear fusion in its core where a helium atom and an electron neutrino are generated by 4 protons. These neutrinos emitted from this reaction are called solar neutrinos. Photons, created by the nuclear fusion in the center of the Sun, take millions of years to reach the surface; on the other hand, solar neutrinos arrive at the earth in eight minutes due to their lack of interactions with matter. Hence, solar neutrinos make it possible for us to observe the inner Sun in \"real-time\" that takes millions of years for visible light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/solarnu-intro-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the Super-Kamiokande detected strong evidence of neutrino oscillation that successfully explained the [[solar neutrino problem]]. The Sun and about 80% of the visible stars produce their energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via\n\n<math>4p \\to {}^4\\!He + 2e^+ + 2 \\nu_e + 26.73</math> MeV\n\nConsequently, stars are a source of neutrinos, including our [[Sun]]. These neutrinos primarily come through the pp-chain in lower masses, and for cooler stars, primarily through CNO-chains of heavier masses.[[File:Pp-chain and CNO chain.jpg|thumb|right|The left frame shows the three principal cycles comprising the pp chain (ppI, ppII, and ppIII), the neutrinos sources associated with these cycles. The right frame shows the CN I cycle.]]\nIn the early 1990s, particularly with the uncertainties that accompanied the initial results from Kamioka II and the Ga experiments, no individual experiment required a non-astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem. But in aggregate, the Cl, Kamioka II, and Ga experiments indicated a pattern of neutrino fluxes that was not compatible with any adjustment of the SSM. This in turn helped motivate a new generation of spectacularly capable active detectors. These experiments are Super-Kamiokande, the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO), and [[Borexino]]. Super-Kamiokande was able to detect elastic scattering (ES) events\n\n<math>\\nu_x + e^- \\to \\nu_x + e^-</math>\n\nwhich, due to the charged-current contribution to <math>\\nu_e</math> scattering, has a relative sensitivity to <math>\\nu_e</math> s and heavy-flavor neutrinos of \u223c7:1.<ref>{{Citation |title=Neutrino oscillations |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |author1=A.B.

The solid line indicates the best fit considering the flux as a free parameter.]]\n\n===Atmospheric neutrino===\nAtmospheric neutrinos are secondary cosmic rays produced by the decay of particles resulting from interactions of primary cosmic rays (mostly [[proton]]s) with [[Earth atmosphere]]. The observed atmospheric neutrino events fall into four categories. Fully contained (FC) events have all their tracks in the inner detector, while partially contained (PC) events have escaping tracks from the inner detector. Upward through-going muons (UTM) are produced in the rock beneath the detector and go through the inner detector. Upward stopping muons (USM) are also produced in the rock beneath the detector, but stop in the inner detector.\n\nThe number of observed number of neutrinos is predicted uniformly regardless of the zenith angle. However, Super-Kamiokande found that the number of upward going muon neutrinos (generated on the other side of the Earth) is half of the number of downward going muon neutrinos in 1998. This can be explained by the neutrinos changing or oscillating into some other neutrinos that are not detected. This is called [[neutrino oscillation]]; this discovery indicates the finite mass of neutrinos and suggests an extension of the Standard Model. Neutrinos oscillate in three flavors, and all neutrinos have their rest mass. Later analysis in 2004 suggested a sinsinusoidal dependence of the event rate as a function of \u201cLength/Energy\u201d, which confirmed the neutrino oscillations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/atmnu-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\n===K2K Experiment===\n{{Main|K2K experiment}}\n\nThe K2K experiment was a neutrino experiment from June 1999 to November 2004. This experiment was designed to verify oscillations observed by Super-Kamiokande through [[muon]] [[neutrinos]]. It gives first positive measurement of [[neutrino oscillations]] in conditions that both source and detector are under control. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays an important role in the experiment as the far detector. Later experiment [[T2K experiment]] continued as the second generation follow up to the [[K2K experiment]].\n\n===T2K Experiment===\n{{Main|T2K experiment}}\n{{wide image|T2K_experiment_beam.png|600px|Passage of the muon neutrino beam from J-PARC to Super K}}\n\nT2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a neutrino experiment collaborated by several countries including [[Japan]], [[United States]] and others. The goal of T2K is to gain deeper understanding of parameters of [[neutrino oscillation]]. T2K has made a search for oscillations from muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos, and announced the first experimental indications for them in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://t2k-experiment.org/t2k/|title=The T2K Experiment|first=The T2K Public Website|last=Committee|date=|website=t2k-experiment.org}}</ref> The Super-Kamiokande detector plays as the \"far detector\". The Super-K detector will record the [[Cherenkov radiation]] of muons and electrons created by interactions between high energy neutrinos and water.\n[[File:A Super-Kamiokande Realtime Monitor result.gif|thumb|right|An almost-live event display from Super-K]]\n\n===Proton Decay===\nThe proton is assumed to be absolutely stable in the [[Standard Model]]. However, the [[Grand Unified Theories]] (GUTs) predict that protons can [[Proton decay|decay]] into lighter energetic charged particles such as electrons, muons, pions, or others which can be observed. Kamiokande helps to rule out some of these theories. Super-Kamiokande is currently the largest detector for observation of proton decay.\n\n==Purification==\n\n===Water purification system===\n[[File:The water purification system of Super-Kamiokande.jpg|thumb|left|A schematic view of the water purification system.]]\nThe 50 ktons pure water is continually reprocessed at rate about 30 tons/h in a closed system since early 2002. Now, raw mine water is recycled through the first step (particle filters and RO) for some time before other processes, which involve expensive expendables, are imposed. Initially, water from the Super-Kamiokande tank is passed through nominal 1 \u03bcm mesh filters to remove dust and particles, which reduce the transparency of the water for Cherenkov photons, and provide a possible radon source inside the Super-Kamiokande detector. Heat exchanger is used to cool down the water in order to reduce the PMT dark noise level as well as suppress the growth of [[bacteria]]. Surviving bacteria are killed by UV sterilizer stage. A cartridge polisher (CP) eliminates heavy ions which also reduce water transparency and include radioactive species. The CP module increases the typical resistivity of recirculating water from 11M\u03a9 cm to 18.24 M\u03a9 cm, approaching chemical limit.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Originally, ion-exchanger (IE) was included in system, but it was removed when IE resin was found to be a significant radon source. The RO step that removes additional particulates, and the introduction of Rn-reduced air into the water that increases radon removal efficiency in the vacuum degasifier (VD) stage which follows were installed in 1999. After that, a VD removes dissolved gases in the water. These gases are dissolved in water with a serious background of events source for solar neutrinos in the MeV energy range and the dissolved [[oxygen]] encourages the growth of bacteria. The removal efficiency is about 96%. Then, the ultra filter (UF)  is introduced to remove particles whose minimum size corresponds to molecular weight approximately 10,000 (or about 10&nbsp;nm diameter) thanks to hollow fiber membrane filters. Finally, a membrane degasifier (MD) removes radon dissolved in water, and the measured removal efficiency for radon is about 83%. The concentration of radon gases is miniaturized by realtime detectors. In June 2001 typical radon concentrations in water coming into the purification system from the Super-Kamiokande tank were <2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, and in water output by the system, 0.4\u00b10.2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air purification system===\nPurified Air is supplied in the gap between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m<sup>3</sup> of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m<sup>3</sup>/h, \u221265&nbsp;\u00b0C (@+1&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and a few mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000\u20133000 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup> during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100\u2013300 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. This variation is due to the [[chimney effect]] in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Wide image|Air_Purification_system_of_Super-Kamiokande.jpg|600px|A schematic view of the air purification system.}}\nIn order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m<sup>3</sup>/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A \u201cRadon Hut\u201d (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40&nbsp;hp air pump with 10 m^3 min<sup>\u22121</sup> /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Data processing==\nOffline data processing is produced both in Kamioka and United States.\n\n===In Kamioka===\nThe offline data processing system is located in Kenkyuto and is connected to Super-Kamiokande detector with 4&nbsp;km FDDI optical fiber link. Data flow from online system is 450 kbytes s<sup>\u22121</sup> on average, corresponding to 40 Gbytes day<sup>\u22121</sup> or 14 Tbytes yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. Magnetic tapes are used in offline system to store data and most of the analysis is accomplished here. The offline processing system is designed platform-independent because different computer architectures are used for data analysis. Because of this, the data structures are based on ZEBRA bank system developed in [[CERN]] as well as the ZEBRA exchange system.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEvent data from Super-Kamiokande online DAQ system basically contains a list of number of hit PMT, TDC and ADC counts, GPS time-stamps and other housekeeping data. For solar neutrino analysis, lowering the energy threshold is a constant goal, so it is a continual effort to improve the efficiency of reduction algorithms; however, changes in calibrations or reduction methods require reprocessing of earlier data.  Typically, 10 Tbytes of raw data is processed every month so that a large amount of CPU power and high-speed I/O access to the raw data. In addition, extensive [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation processing is also necessary.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOffline system was designed to meet demand of all these: tape storage of a large database (14 Tbytes yr\u22121), stable semi-realtime processing, nearly continuous re-processing and Monte Carlo simulation. The computer system consists of 3 major sub-systems: the data server, the CPU farm and the network at the end of Run I.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===In US===\nA system dedicated to offsite offline data processing was set up at the [[Stony Brook University]] in Stony Brook, NY to process raw data sent from Kamioka. Most of the reformatted raw data is copied from system facility in Kamioka. At Stony Brook, a system was set up for analysis and further processing. At Stony Brook the raw data were processed with a multi-tape DLT drive. The first stage data reduction processes were done for the high energy analysis and for the low energy analysis. The data reduction for the high energy analysis was mainly for atmospheric neutrino events and proton decay search while the low energy analysis was mainly for the solar neutrino events. The reduced data for the high energy analysis was further filtered by other reduction processes and the resulting data were stored on disks. The reduced data for the low energy were stored on DLT tapes and sent to [[University of California]], Irvine for further processing.\n\nThis offset analysis system continued for 3 years until their analysis chains were proved to produce equivalent results. Thus, in order to limited manpower, collaborations were concentrated to single combined analysis<ref>{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande Detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |author1=S.

It is located {{Convert|1000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} underground in the Mozumi [[Mining|Mine]] in Hida's Kamioka area. The observatory was designed to detect high-energy neutrinos, to search for [[proton decay]], study [[solar neutrino|solar]] and [[Neutrino#Atmospheric neutrinos|atmospheric neutrinos]], and keep watch for [[supernova]]e in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].\n\nIt consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank about {{Convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and diameter holding 50,000 tons of [[ultrapure water]]. Mounted on an inside superstructure are about 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes that detect light from [[Cherenkov radiation]]. A neutrino interaction with the [[electron]]s of nuclei of water can produce an electron or positron that moves faster than the [[speed of light#Propagation of light|speed of light in water]], which is lower than the [[speed of light in a vacuum]].

This creates a cone of light known as [[Cherenkov radiation]], which is the optical equivalent to a [[sonic boom]]. The Cherenkov light is projected as a ring on the wall of the detector and recorded by the PMTs. Using the timing and charge information recorded by each PMT, the interaction vertex, ring direction and flavor of the incoming neutrino is determined. From the sharpness of the edge of the ring the type of particle can be inferred. The [[scattering|multiple scattering]] of electrons is large, so electromagnetic showers produce fuzzy rings. Highly [[special relativity|relativistic]] [[muon]]s, in contrast, travel almost straight through the detector and produce rings with sharp edges.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Kamiokande89.JPG|thumb|right|A model of KamiokaNDE]]\nConstruction of the predecessor of the present [[Kamioka Observatory]], the [[Institute for Cosmic Ray Research]], [[University of Tokyo]] began in 1982 and was completed in April 1983. The purpose of the observatory was to detect whether [[proton decay]] exists, one of the most fundamental questions of elementary particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html|title=\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30da\u30fc\u30b8 - Kamioka Observatory, ICRR, University of Tokyo|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/|title=Physics Home|author=|date=|website=www.phys.washington.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/gallery/index-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Photo Gallery|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cause-committee/1st/report-nov22e.pdf|title=Official report on the accident (in PDF format)|author=|date=|website=u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000327|title=Logbook entry of first neutrinos seen at Super-K generated at KEK|author=|date=|website=symmetrymagazine.org}}</ref>\n\nThe detector, named KamiokaNDE for Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment, was a [[chemical tank|tank]] {{Convert|16.0|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and {{Convert|15.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in width, containing 3,048 metric tons (3,000 tons) of pure water and about 1,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) attached to its inner surface. The detector was upgraded, starting in 1985, to allow it to observe solar neutrinos. As a result, the detector (KamiokaNDE-II) had become sensitive enough to detect neutrinos from [[SN 1987A]], a [[supernova]] which was observed in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] in February 1987, and to observe solar neutrinos in 1988. The ability of the Kamiokande experiment to observe the direction of electrons produced in solar neutrino [[elastic scattering|interactions]] allowed experimenters to directly demonstrate for the first time that the sun was a source of neutrinos.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande project was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture in 1991 for total funding of approximately $100 M. The US portion of the proposal, which was primarily to build the OD system, was approved by the US Department of Energy in 1993 for $3 M. In addition the US has also contributed about 2000 20&nbsp;cm PMTs recycled from the [[Irvine\u2013Michigan\u2013Brookhaven (detector)|IMB experiment]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDespite successes in [[neutrino astronomy]] and neutrino astrophysics, Kamiokande did not achieve its primary goal, the detection of proton decay. Higher sensitivity was also necessary to obtain high statistical confidence in its results. This led to the construction of Super-Kamiokande, with fifteen times the water and ten times as many PMTs as Kamiokande. Super-Kamiokande started operation in 1996.\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande Collaboration announced the first evidence of [[neutrino oscillation]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fukuda, Y. | display-authors = etal | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 81 | issue = 8 | pages = 1562\u20131567 | date = 1998 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1562 | title = Evidence for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos | arxiv = hep-ex/9807003 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.1562F }}</ref> This was the first experimental observation supporting the theory that the neutrino has non-zero [[mass]], a possibility that theorists had speculated about for years. The 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to Super-Kamiokande researcher [[Takaaki Kajita]] alongside [[Arthur B. McDonald|Arthur McDonald]] for their work on neutrino oscillations.\n\nOn 12 November 2001, about 6,600 of the photomultiplier tubes (costing about $3000 each<ref>{{cite web|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/accident-grounds-neutrino-lab/|title=Accident grounds neutrino lab|author=|date=|website=physicsworld.com}}</ref>) in the Super-Kamiokande detector [[Implosion (mechanical process)|imploded]], apparently in a [[chain reaction]] or [[cascading failure]], as the [[shock wave]] from the concussion of each imploding tube cracked its neighbours. The detector was partially restored by redistributing the photomultiplier tubes which did not implode, and by adding protective [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] shells that are hoped will prevent another chain reaction from recurring (Super-Kamiokande-II).\n\nIn July 2005, preparations began to restore the detector to its original form by reinstalling about 6,000 PMTs. The work was completed in June 2006, whereupon the detector was renamed Super-Kamiokande-III. This phase of the experiment collected data from October 2006 till August 2008. At that time, significant upgrades were made to the electronics. After the upgrade, the new phase of the experiment has been referred to as Super-Kamiokande-IV. SK-IV collected data on various natural sources of neutrinos, as well as acted as the far detector for the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.\n\nSK-IV continued until June 2018. After that, the detector underwent a full refurbishment during Autumn of 2018. On 29 January 2019 the detector resumed data-taking.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00440-2|pmid = 30728526| title=Neutrino hunt resumes, ITER's new confidence and Elsevier's woes| journal=Nature| volume=566| issue=7742| pages=12\u201313| year=2019| bibcode=2019Natur.566...12.}}</ref>\n\n==Detector==\nThe Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a Cherenkov detector used to study neutrinos from different sources including the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and accelerators. It is also used to search for proton decay. The experiment began in April 1996 and was shut down for maintenance in July 2001, a period known as \"SK-I\". Since an accident occurred during maintenance, the experiment resumed in October 2002 with only half of its original number of ID-PMTs.  In order to prevent further accidents, all of the ID-PMTs were covered by fiber-reinforced plastic with acrylic front windows. This phase from October 2002 to another closure for an entire reconstruction in October 2005 is called \"SK-II\". In July 2006, the experiment resumed with the full number of PMTs and stopped in September 2008 for electronics upgrades. This period was known as \"SK-III\". The period after 2008 is known as \"SK-IV\".

Beta decay in the Earth and in supernovas turns neutrons into protons with the emission of anti-neutrinos. The Super-Kamiokande detects electrons knocked off a water molecule producing a flash of blue Cherenkov light, and these are produced both by neutrinos and antineutrinos.  A rarer instance is when an antineutrino interacts with a proton in water to produce a neutron and a positron.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Castelvecchi|first=Davide|date=2019-02-27|title=Gigantic Japanese detector prepares to catch neutrinos from supernovae|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=566|issue=7745|pages=438\u2013439|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00598-9}}</ref>\n\nGadolinium has an affinity for neutrons and produces a bright flash of gamma rays when it absorbs one. Adding gadolinium to the Super-Kamiokande allows it to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Antineutrinos produce a double flash of light about 30 microseconds apart, first when the neutrino hits a proton and second when gadolinium absorbs a neutron.<ref name=\":0\" /> The brightness of the first flash allows physicists to distinguish between low energy antineutrinos from the Earth and high energy antineutrinos from supernovas. In addition to observing neutrinos from distant supernovas, the Super-Kamiokande will be able to set off an alarm to inform astronomers around the world of the presence of a supernova in the Milky Way within one second of it occurring.\n\nThe biggest challenge was whether the detector's water could be continuously filtered to remove impurities without removing the gadolinium at the same time. A 200-ton prototype called EGADS with added gadolinium sulfate was installed in the Kamioka mine and operated for years. It finished operation in 2018 and showed that the new water purification system would remove impurities while keeping the gadolinium concentration stable. It also showed that gadolinium sulfate would not significantly impair the transparency of the otherwise ultrapure water, or cause corrosion or deposition on existing equipment or on the new valves that will later be installed in the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Water tank===\nThe outer shell of the water tank is a cylindrical stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The tank is self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the tank is filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 ktons of water.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |volume=51 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |author1=S.

Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames are connected to each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected to the bottom of the tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, supermodules simplified the initial assembly of the ID. Each supermodule was assembled on the tank floor and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with supermodules. During installation, ID PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.[[File:The PMTs used in Super-Kamiokande.gif|thumb|right|Schematic view of a 50 cm PMT.]]\n\nCables from each group of 3 PMTs are bundled together. All cables run up the outer surface of the PMT support structure, i.e., on the OD PMT plane, pass through cable ports at the top of the tank, and are then routed into the electronics huts.\n\nThe thickness of the OD varies slightly, but is on average about 2.6 m on top and bottom, and 2.7 m on the barrel wall, giving the OD a total mass of 18 kilotons. OD PMTs were distributed with 302 on the top layer, 308 on the bottom, and 1275 on the barrel wall.\n\nTo protect against low energy background from radon decay products in the air, the roof of the cavity and the access tunnels were sealed with a coating called Mineguard. Mineguard is a spray-applied polyurethane membrane developed for use as a rock support system and radon gas barrier in the mining industry.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe average geomagnetic field is about 450 mG and is inclined by about 45\u00b0 with respect to the horizon at the detector site. This presents a problem for the large and very sensitive PMTs which prefer a much lower ambient field. The strength and uniform direction of the geomagnetic field could systematically bias photoelectron trajectories and timing in the PMTs. To counteract this 26 sets of horizontal and vertical Helmholtz coils are arranged around the inner surfaces of the tank. With these in operation the average field in the detector is reduced to about 50 mG. The magnetic field at various PMT locations were measured before the tank was filled with water.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nA standard fiducial volume of approximately 22.5 ktons is defined as the region inside a surface drawn 2.00 m from the ID wall to minimize the anomalous response causing by natural radioactivity in the surrounding rock.\n\n==Monitoring system==\n\n===Online monitoring system===\nAn online monitor computer located in the control room reads data from the DAQ host computer via an FDDI link. It provides shift operators with a flexible tool for selecting event display features, makes online and recent-history histograms to monitor detector performance, and performs a variety of additional tasks needed to efficiently monitor status and diagnose detector and DAQ problems. Events in the data stream can be skimmed off and elementary analysis tools can be applied to check data quality during calibrations or after changes in hardware or online software.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Realtime supernova monitor===\nTo detect and identify such bursts as efficiently and promptly as possible Super-Kamiokande is equipped with an online supernova monitor system. About 10,000 total events are expected in Super-Kamiokande for a supernova explosion at the center of our Galaxy. Super-Kamiokande can measure a burst with no dead-time, up to 30,000 events within the first second of a burst. Theoretical calculations of supernova explosions suggest that neutrinos are emitted over a total time-scale of tens of seconds with about a half of them emitted during the first one or two seconds. The Super-K will search for event clusters in specified time windows of 0.5, 2 and 10 s.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Data are transmitted to realtime SN-watch analysis process every 2 min and analysis is completed typically in 1 min. When supernova (SN) event candidates are found, <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is calculated if the event multiplicity is larger than 16, where <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> is defined as the average spatial distance between events, i.e.\n\n<math>{R_\\text{mean}} =\\frac {\\sum_{i=1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{{N_\\text{multi}}} |{r_\\text{i}}-{r_\\text{j}}|} {{N_\\text{nulti}} {C_\\text{2}}}</math>\n\nNeutrinos from supernovae interact with free protons, producing positrons which are distributed so uniformly in the detector that <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math> for SN events should be significantly larger than for ordinary spatial clusters of events. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, Rmean for uniformly distributed Monte Carlo events shows that no tail exists below <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7d1000&nbsp;cm. For the \u201calarm\u201d class of burst, the events are required to have <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e900&nbsp;cm for 25\u2a7d<math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>\u2a7d40 or <math>{R_\\text{mean}}</math>\u2a7e750&nbsp;cm for <math>{N_\\text{multi}}</math>>40.

If the burst candidate passes these checks, the data will be reanalyzed using an offline process and a final decision will be made within a few hours. During the Super-Kamiokande I running, this never occurred.\nOne of the important capabilities for [Super-Kamiokande] is to reconstruct the direction to supernova. By neutrino\u2013electron scattering, <math>\\nu_\\text{x} + e^- \\to \\nu_\\text{x} + e^-</math>, a total of 100\u2013150 events are expected in case of a supernova at the center of our Galaxy.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The direction to supernova can be measured with angular resolution\n\n<math>\\delta \\theta \\sim {30^\\circ \\over \\sqrt{N}}</math>\n\nwhere N is the number of events produced by the \u03bd\u2013e scattering. The angular resolution, therefore, can be as good as \u03b4\u03b8\u223c3\u00b0 for a supernova at the center of our Galaxy.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this case, not only time profile and the energy spectrum of a neutrino burst, but also the information on direction of supernova can be provided.\n\n===Slow control monitor and offline process monitor===\nThere is a process called the \u201cslow control\u201d monitor, as part of the online monitoring system, watches the status of the HV systems, the temperatures of electronics crates and the status of the compensating coils used to cancel the geomagnetic field. When any deviation from norms is detected, it will alert physicists to prompt to investigate, take appropriate action, or notify experts.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nTo monitor and control the offline processes that analyze and transfer data, a set of software was sophisticatedly developed. This monitor allows non-expert shift physicists to identify and repair common problems to minimize down time, and the software package was a significant contribution to the smooth operation of the experiment and its overall high lifetime efficiency for data taking.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Research==\n\n===Solar neutrino===\n{{See also|Neutrino Oscillation}}\nThe energy of the Sun comes from the nuclear fusion in its core where a helium atom and an electron neutrino are generated by 4 protons. These neutrinos emitted from this reaction are called solar neutrinos. Photons, created by the nuclear fusion in the center of the Sun, take millions of years to reach the surface; on the other hand, solar neutrinos arrive at the earth in eight minutes due to their lack of interactions with matter. Hence, solar neutrinos make it possible for us to observe the inner Sun in \"real-time\" that takes millions of years for visible light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/solarnu-intro-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the Super-Kamiokande detected strong evidence of neutrino oscillation that successfully explained the [[solar neutrino problem]]. The Sun and about 80% of the visible stars produce their energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via\n\n<math>4p \\to {}^4\\!He + 2e^+ + 2 \\nu_e + 26.73</math> MeV\n\nConsequently, stars are a source of neutrinos, including our [[Sun]]. These neutrinos primarily come through the pp-chain in lower masses, and for cooler stars, primarily through CNO-chains of heavier masses.[[File:Pp-chain and CNO chain.jpg|thumb|right|The left frame shows the three principal cycles comprising the pp chain (ppI, ppII, and ppIII), the neutrinos sources associated with these cycles. The right frame shows the CN I cycle.]]\nIn the early 1990s, particularly with the uncertainties that accompanied the initial results from Kamioka II and the Ga experiments, no individual experiment required a non-astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem. But in aggregate, the Cl, Kamioka II, and Ga experiments indicated a pattern of neutrino fluxes that was not compatible with any adjustment of the SSM. This in turn helped motivate a new generation of spectacularly capable active detectors. These experiments are Super-Kamiokande, the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO), and [[Borexino]]. Super-Kamiokande was able to detect elastic scattering (ES) events\n\n<math>\\nu_x + e^- \\to \\nu_x + e^-</math>\n\nwhich, due to the charged-current contribution to <math>\\nu_e</math> scattering, has a relative sensitivity to <math>\\nu_e</math> s and heavy-flavor neutrinos of \u223c7:1.<ref>{{Citation |title=Neutrino oscillations |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |author1=A.B.

The observed atmospheric neutrino events fall into four categories. Fully contained (FC) events have all their tracks in the inner detector, while partially contained (PC) events have escaping tracks from the inner detector. Upward through-going muons (UTM) are produced in the rock beneath the detector and go through the inner detector. Upward stopping muons (USM) are also produced in the rock beneath the detector, but stop in the inner detector.\n\nThe number of observed number of neutrinos is predicted uniformly regardless of the zenith angle. However, Super-Kamiokande found that the number of upward going muon neutrinos (generated on the other side of the Earth) is half of the number of downward going muon neutrinos in 1998. This can be explained by the neutrinos changing or oscillating into some other neutrinos that are not detected. This is called [[neutrino oscillation]]; this discovery indicates the finite mass of neutrinos and suggests an extension of the Standard Model. Neutrinos oscillate in three flavors, and all neutrinos have their rest mass. Later analysis in 2004 suggested a sinsinusoidal dependence of the event rate as a function of \u201cLength/Energy\u201d, which confirmed the neutrino oscillations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/physics/atmnu-e.html|title=Super-Kamiokande Official Homepage|author=|date=|website=www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp}}</ref>\n\n===K2K Experiment===\n{{Main|K2K experiment}}\n\nThe K2K experiment was a neutrino experiment from June 1999 to November 2004. This experiment was designed to verify oscillations observed by Super-Kamiokande through [[muon]] [[neutrinos]]. It gives first positive measurement of [[neutrino oscillations]] in conditions that both source and detector are under control. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays an important role in the experiment as the far detector. Later experiment [[T2K experiment]] continued as the second generation follow up to the [[K2K experiment]].\n\n===T2K Experiment===\n{{Main|T2K experiment}}\n{{wide image|T2K_experiment_beam.png|600px|Passage of the muon neutrino beam from J-PARC to Super K}}\n\nT2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a neutrino experiment collaborated by several countries including [[Japan]], [[United States]] and others. The goal of T2K is to gain deeper understanding of parameters of [[neutrino oscillation]]. T2K has made a search for oscillations from muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos, and announced the first experimental indications for them in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://t2k-experiment.org/t2k/|title=The T2K Experiment|first=The T2K Public Website|last=Committee|date=|website=t2k-experiment.org}}</ref> The Super-Kamiokande detector plays as the \"far detector\". The Super-K detector will record the [[Cherenkov radiation]] of muons and electrons created by interactions between high energy neutrinos and water.\n[[File:A Super-Kamiokande Realtime Monitor result.gif|thumb|right|An almost-live event display from Super-K]]\n\n===Proton Decay===\nThe proton is assumed to be absolutely stable in the [[Standard Model]]. However, the [[Grand Unified Theories]] (GUTs) predict that protons can [[Proton decay|decay]] into lighter energetic charged particles such as electrons, muons, pions, or others which can be observed. Kamiokande helps to rule out some of these theories. Super-Kamiokande is currently the largest detector for observation of proton decay.\n\n==Purification==\n\n===Water purification system===\n[[File:The water purification system of Super-Kamiokande.jpg|thumb|left|A schematic view of the water purification system.]]\nThe 50 ktons pure water is continually reprocessed at rate about 30 tons/h in a close system since early 2002. Now, raw mine water is recycled through the first step (particle filters and RO) for some time before other processes, which involve expensive expendables, are imposed. Initially, water from the Super-Kamiokande tank is passed through nominal 1 \u03bcm mesh filters to remove dust and particles, which reduce the transparency of the water for Cherenkov photons, and provide a possible radon source inside the Super-Kamiokande detector. Heat exchanger is used to cool down the water in order to reduce the PMT dark noise level as well as suppress the growth of [[bacteria]]. Surviving bacteria are killed by UV sterilizer stage. A cartridge polisher (CP) eliminates heavy ions which also reduce water transparency and include radioactive species. The CP module increases the typical resistivity of recirculating water from 11M\u03a9 cm to 18.24 M\u03a9 cm, approaching chemical limit.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Originally, ion-exchanger (IE) was included in system, but it was removed when IE resin was found to be a significant radon source. The RO step that removes additional particulates, and the introduction of Rn-reduced air into the water that increases radon removal efficiency in the vacuum degasifier (VD) stage which follows were installed in 1999. After that, a VD removes dissolved gases in the water. These gases are dissolved in water with a serious background of events source for solar neutrinos in the MeV energy range and the dissolved [[oxygen]] encourages the growth of bacteria. The removal efficiency is about 96%. Then, the ultra filter (UF)  is introduced to remove particles whose minimum size corresponds to molecular weight approximately 10,000 (or about 10&nbsp;nm diameter) thanks to hollow fiber membrane filters. Finally, a membrane degasifier (MD) removes radon dissolved in water, and the measured removal efficiency for radon is about 83%. The concentration of radon gases is miniaturized by realtime detectors. In June 2001 typical radon concentrations in water coming into the purification system from the Super-Kamiokande tank were <2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, and in water output by the system, 0.4\u00b10.2 mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air purification system===\nPurified Air is supplied in the gap between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m<sup>3</sup> of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m<sup>3</sup>/h, \u221265&nbsp;\u00b0C (@+1&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), and a few mBq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000\u20133000 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup> during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100\u2013300 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>. This variation is due to the [[chimney effect]] in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Wide image|Air_Purification_system_of_Super-Kamiokande.jpg|600px|A schematic view of the air purification system.}}\nIn order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m<sup>\u22123</sup>, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m<sup>3</sup>/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A \u201cRadon Hut\u201d (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40&nbsp;hp air pump with 10 m^3 min<sup>\u22121</sup> /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Data processing==\nOffline data processing is produced both in Kamioka and United States.\n\n===In Kamioka===\nThe offline data processing system is located in Kenkyuto and is connected to Super-Kamiokande detector with 4&nbsp;km FDDI optical fiber link. Data flow from online system is 450 kbytes s<sup>\u22121</sup> on average, corresponding to 40 Gbytes day<sup>\u22121</sup> or 14 Tbytes yr<sup>\u22121</sup>. Magnetic tapes are used in offline system to store data and most of the analysis is accomplished here. The offline processing system is designed platform-independent because different computer architectures are used for data analysis. Because of this, the data structures are based on ZEBRA bank system developed in [[CERN]] as well as the ZEBRA exchange system.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEvent data from Super-Kamiokande online DAQ system basically contains a list of number of hit PMT, TDC and ADC counts, GPS time-stamps and other housekeeping data. For solar neutrino analysis, lowering the energy threshold is a constant goal, so it is a continual effort to improve the efficiency of reduction algorithms; however, changes in calibrations or reduction methods require reprocessing of earlier data.  Typically, 10 Tbytes of raw data is processed every month so that a large amount of CPU power and high-speed I/O access to the raw data. In addition, extensive [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation processing is also necessary.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOffline system was designed to meet demand of all these: tape storage of a large database (14 Tbytes yr\u22121), stable semi-realtime processing, nearly continuous re-processing and Monte Carlo simulation. The computer system consists of 3 major sub-systems: the data server, the CPU farm and the network at the end of Run I.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===In US===\nA system dedicated to offsite offline data processing was set up at the [[Stony Brook University]] in Stony Brook, NY to process raw data sent from Kamioka. Most of the reformatted raw data is copied from system facility in Kamioka. At Stony Brook, a system was set up for analysis and further processing. At Stony Brook the raw data were processed with a multi-tape DLT drive. The first stage data reduction processes were done for the high energy analysis and for the low energy analysis. The data reduction for the high energy analysis was mainly for atmospheric neutrino events and proton decay search while the low energy analysis was mainly for the solar neutrino events. The reduced data for the high energy analysis was further filtered by other reduction processes and the resulting data were stored on disks. The reduced data for the low energy were stored on DLT tapes and sent to [[University of California]], Irvine for further processing.\n\nThis offset analysis system continued for 3 years until their analysis chains were proved to produce equivalent results. Thus, in order to limited manpower, collaborations were concentrated to single combined analysis<ref>{{Citation |title=The Super-Kamiokande Detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A |author1=S.
