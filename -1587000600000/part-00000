As the LNG market grows rapidly,<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/global/lngmarket.html The Global Liquefied Natural Gas Market: Status and Outlook]</ref> the fleet of LNG carriers continues to experience tremendous growth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Delivered LNG.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of new build rate.]]\n\nThe first LNG carrier ''[[Methane Pioneer]]'' ({{DWT|5034}}) left the Calcasieu River on the Louisiana Gulf coast on 25 January 1959. Carrying the world's first ocean cargo of LNG, it sailed to the UK where the cargo was delivered. Subsequent expansion of that trade has brought on a large expansion of the fleet to today where giant LNG ships carrying up to {{convert|266,000|m3|abbr=on}} are sailing worldwide.\n\nThe success of the specially modified C1-M-AV1-type standard ship ''Normarti'', renamed ''Methane Pioneer'', caused the Gas Council and Conch International Methane Ltd. to order two purpose built LNG carriers to be constructed: ''Methane Princess'' and ''Methane Progress''. The ships were fitted with Conch independent aluminum cargo tanks and entered the Algerian LNG trade in 1964. These ships had a capacity of {{convert|27,000|m3}}.\n\nIn the late 1960s, opportunity arose to export LNG from [[Alaska]] to [[Japan]], and in 1969 that trade with [[Tokyo Electric Power Company|TEPCO]] and [[Tokyo Gas]] was initiated. Two ships, ''Polar Alaska'' and ''Arctic Tokyo'', each with a capacity of {{convert|71,500|m3}}, were built in Sweden. In the early 1970s, the US government encouraged US shipyards to build LNG carriers, and a total of 16 LNG ships were built. The late 1970s and early 1980s brought the prospect of Arctic LNG ships with a number of projects being studied.\n\nWith the increase in cargo capacity to approximately {{convert|143,000|m3}}, new tank designs were developed, from Moss Rosenberg to Technigaz Mark III and Gaztransport No.96.\n\nIn recent years, the size and capacity of LNG carriers has increased greatly.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ulvestad|first1= Marte|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2012|title= Natural gas and CO2 price variation: Impact on the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipelines|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261221877_Natural_gas_and_CO2_price_variation_Impact_on_the_relative_cost-efficiency_of_LNG_and_pipelines|journal=\"International Journal of Environmental Studies\"|volume=69|issue=3|pages=407\u2013426}}</ref> Since 2005, Qatargas has pioneered the development of two new classes of LNG carriers, referred to as [[Q-Flex]] and [[Q-Max]]. Each ship has a cargo capacity of between {{convert|210,000|and|266,000|m3}} and is equipped with a re-liquefaction plant.\n\nToday we see interest for small scale LNG bunker carriers. Some need to stay below the life rafts of Cruise ships and Ropax vessels. Examples are the Damen LGC 3000 (http://products.damen.com/en/ranges/liquefied-gas-carrier) and the [[Seagas]].\n\n{{as of|2005}}, a total of 203 vessels had been built, of which 193 were still in service.

South Korean builders captured 78% of LNG-related ship building contracts in 2018, with 14% going to Japanese builders and 8% going to Chinese builders. The new contracts would boost the global LNG fleet by 10%. Of the global fleet, historically, about two-thirds of the ships have been built by South Koreans, 22% by Japanese, 7% by Chinese, and the rest built by a combination of France, Spain, and the United States. South Korea's success stems from innovation and price point; South Korean builders introduced the first ice-breaker type LNG vessels and South Korean builders have been successful in catering to increased customer preference for Q-max vessels over Moss type.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lng-south-korea-shipping/south-korean-shipbuilders-lock-on-lng-tanker-market-to-hold-for-years-idUSKCN1NP001|title=South Korean shipbuilders' lock on LNG tanker market to hold for years|publisher=Reuters|author=Jane Chung, Yuka Obayashi|date=November 19, 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 South Koreas's first LNG powered bulk carrier (Green Iris) will begin construction.

Surrounding the tanks is a combination of [[ballast tank]]s, [[Cofferdam#Naval architecture|cofferdams]] and voids; in effect, this gives the vessel a double-hull type design.\n\nInside each tank there are typically three submerged pumps. There are two main cargo pumps which are used in cargo discharge operations and a much smaller pump which is referred to as the spray pump. The spray pump is used for either pumping out liquid LNG to be used as fuel (via a vaporizer), or for cooling down cargo tanks. It can also be used for \"stripping\" out the last of the cargo in discharge operations. All of these pumps are contained within what is known as the pump tower which hangs from the top of the tank and runs the entire depth of the tank. The pump tower also contains the tank gauging system and the tank filling line, all of which are located near the bottom of the tank.\n\nIn membrane-type vessels there is also an empty pipe with a spring-loaded foot valve that can be opened by weight or pressure. This is the emergency pump tower. In the event both main cargo pumps fail the top can be removed from this pipe and an emergency cargo pump lowered down to the bottom of the pipe. The top is replaced on the column and then the pump is allowed to push down on the foot valve and open it. The cargo can then be pumped out.\n\nAll cargo pumps discharge into a common pipe which runs along the deck of the vessel; it branches off to either side of the vessel to the cargo manifolds, which are used for loading or discharging.\n\nAll cargo tank vapour spaces are linked via a vapour header which runs parallel to the cargo header. This also has connections to the sides of the ship next to the loading and discharging manifolds.\n\n==Typical cargo cycle==\nA typical cargo cycle starts with the tanks in a \"gas free\" condition, meaning the tanks are full of air, which allows maintenance on the tank and pumps. Cargo cannot be loaded directly into the tank, as the presence of oxygen would create an explosive atmospheric condition within the tank, and the rapid temperature change caused by loading LNG at {{convert|\u2212162|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} could damage the tanks.\n\nFirst, the tank must be 'inerted' to eliminate the risk of explosion. An inert gas plant burns diesel in air to produce a mixture of gases (typically less than 5% O2 and about 13% CO<sub>2</sub> plus N<sub>2</sub>). This is blown into the tanks until the oxygen level is below 4%.\n\nNext, the vessel goes into port to \"gas-up\" and \"cool-down\", as one still cannot load directly into the tank: The CO<sub>2</sub> will freeze and damage the pumps and the cold shock could damage the tank's pump column.\n\nLNG is brought onto the vessel and taken along the spray line to the main vaporiser, which boils off the liquid into gas. This is then warmed up to roughly {{convert|20|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in the gas heaters and then blown into the tanks to displace the \"inert gas\". This continues until all the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the tanks. Initially, the IG (inert gas) is vented to atmosphere. Once the hydrocarbon content reaches 5% (lower flammability range of methane) the inert gas is redirected to shore via a pipeline and manifold connection by the HD (high duty) compressors. The shore terminal then burns this vapour to avoid the dangers of having large amounts of hydrocarbons present which may explode.\n\nNow the vessel is gassed up and warm. The tanks are still at ambient temperature and are full of methane.\n\nThe next stage is cool-down. LNG is sprayed into the tanks via spray heads, which vaporises and starts to cool the tank. The excess gas is again blown ashore to be re-liquified or burned at a [[gas flare|flare stack]]. Once the tanks reach about {{convert|\u2212140|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} the tanks are ready to bulk load.\n\nBulk loading starts and liquid LNG is pumped from the storage tanks ashore into the vessel tanks. Displaced gas is blown ashore by the HD compressors. Loading continues until typically 98.5% full is reached (to allow for thermal expansion/contraction of cargo).\n\nThe vessel can now proceed to the discharge port. During passage various boil-off management strategies can be used. Boil-off gas can be burned in boilers to provide propulsion, or it can be re-liquefied and returned to the cargo tanks, depending on the design of the vessel.\n\nOnce in the discharge port, the cargo is pumped ashore using the cargo pumps. As the tank empties, the vapour space is filled by either gas from ashore or by vaporising some cargo in the cargo vaporiser. Either the vessel can be pumped out as far as possible, with the last being pumped out with spray pumps, or some cargo can be retained on board as a \"heel\".\n\nIt is normal practice to keep onboard 5% to 10%{{Citation needed|reason=Some other sources state up to an order of magnitude less than this quantity as the amount required for cool-down.|date=March 2014}} of the cargo after discharge in one tank. This is referred to as the heel and this is used to cool down the remaining tanks that have no heel before loading. This must be done gradually otherwise the tanks will be cold shocked if loaded directly into warm tanks. Cool-down can take roughly 20<ref>GIIGNL Fourth Edition 2.6.2</ref> hours on a Moss vessel (and 10\u201312 hours on a membrane type vessel), so carrying a heel allows cool-down to be done before the vessel reaches port giving a significant time saving.\n\nIf all the cargo is pumped ashore, then on the ballast passage the tanks will warm up to ambient temperature, returning the vessel to a gassed up and warm state. The vessel can then be cooled again for loading.\n\nIf the vessel is to return to a gas free state, the tanks must be warmed up by using the gas heaters to circulate warm gas. Once the tanks are warmed up, the inert gas plant is used to remove the methane from the tanks. Once the tanks are methane free, the inert gas plant is switched to dry air production, which is used to remove all the inert gas from the tanks until they have a safe working atmosphere.\n\nTransportation of natural gas both in the form of LNG and by pipeline causes greenhouse gas emissions, but in different ways. With pipelines, most of the emissions stem from the production of steel pipe; with LNG most of the emissions stem from liquefaction. For both pipelines and LNG, propulsion causes additional emissions (pressurization of the pipeline, propulsion of the LNG tanker).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ulvestad|first=Marte|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2012|title=Natural Gas and CO2 price variation: Impact on the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipelines|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261221877|journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies|volume=69|pages=407\u2013426|via=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261221877}}</ref>\n\n==Containment systems==\n[[File:LNGtanker.jpg|thumb|The inside of a Moss-type LNG carrier]]\n\nToday there are four containment systems in use for new build vessels. Two of the designs are of the self-supporting type, while the other two are of the membrane type and today the patents are owned by [[Gaztransport & Technigaz]] (GTT).\n\nThere is a trend towards the use of the two different membrane types instead of the self-supporting storage systems. This is most likely because prismatic membrane tanks utilize the hull shape more efficiently and thus have less void space between the cargo-tanks and ballast tanks. As a result of this, Moss-type design compared to a membrane design of equal capacity will be far more expensive to transit the [[Suez Canal]]. However, self-supporting tanks are more robust and have greater resistance to sloshing forces, and will possibly be considered in the future for offshore storage where bad weather will be a significant factor.\n\n===Moss tanks (Spherical IMO type B LNG tanks)===\n[[File:LNG tanker (side view).PNG|thumb|right|LNG Moss-type tanker, side view]]\nNamed after the company that designed them, the Norwegian company Moss Maritime, the Spherical IMO type B LNG tanks are spherical in shape. Most Moss type vessels have 4 or 5 tanks.\n\nThe outside of the tank has a thick layer of foam insulation that is either fitted in panels or in more modern designs wound round the tank. Over this insulation is a thin layer of \"tinfoil\" which allows the insulation to be kept dry with a nitrogen atmosphere. This atmosphere is constantly checked for any methane that would indicate a leak of the tank. Also the outside of the tank is checked at 3-month intervals for any cold spots that would indicate breakdown in the insulation.\n\nThe tank is supported around its circumference by the equatorial ring, which is supported by a large circular skirt, known as a data-couple that is a unique combination of aluminum and steel, which takes the weight of the tank down to the ships structure. This skirt allows the tank to expand and contract during cool-down and warm-up operations. During cool-down or warm-up the tank can expand or contract about {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}. Because of this expansion and contraction all piping into the tank comes in the top and is connected to the ships lines via flexible bellows.\n\nInside each tank there is a set of spray heads. These heads are mounted around the equatorial ring and are used to spray Liquid LNG onto the tank walls to reduce the temperature.\n\nTanks normally have a working pressure of up to {{convert|22|kPa|abbr=on}}, but this can be raised for an emergency discharge. If both main pumps fail then to remove the cargo, the tank's safety valves are adjusted to lift at 100 kPa. Then the filling line which goes to the bottom of the tank is opened along with the filling lines of the other tanks on board. The pressure is then raised in the tank with the defective pumps which pushes the cargo into the other tanks where it can be pumped out.\n\n===IHI (Prismatic IMO type B LNG tanks)===\nDesigned by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, the ''self-supporting prismatic type B (SPB)'' tank is currently employed in only two vessels. Type B tanks limit sloshing problems, an improvement over Membrane LNG carrier tanks which may break due to sloshing impact, therefore destroying the ship's hull. This is also of prime relevance for [[Floating production storage and offloading|FPSO]] LNG (or FLNG).\n\nIn addition, IMO type B LNG tanks can sustain internal accidental damage due for example to internal equipment releases. This was incorporated into the design following several incidents that occurred inside membrane LNG tanks.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===TGZ Mark III===\n[[File:Liquid natural gas membrane tank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Interior of a non-spherical, Technigaz Mark III stainless steel membrane, LNG tank]]\nDesigned by [[Gaztransport & Technigaz|Technigaz]], these tanks are of the membrane type. The membrane consists of stainless steel with 'waffles' to absorb the thermal contraction when the tank is cooled down.  The primary barrier, made of corrugated stainless steel of about {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on}} thickness is the one in direct contact with the cargo liquid (or vapour in empty tank condition). This is followed by a primary insulation which in turn is covered by a secondary barrier made of a material called \"triplex\" which is basically a metal foil sandwiched between glasswool sheets and compressed together. This is again covered by a secondary insulation which in turn is supported by the ship's hull structure from the outside.<ref>{{cite web|title=GTT Mark III Technology|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ghACzdfnak|publisher=Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) via YouTube|date=Nov 7, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"NWSSSC membrane tanks\">{{cite web|title=Membrane Containment System|url=http://www.nwsssc.com/fleet/ship-technical-information/membrane-containment-system|publisher=North West Shelf Shipping Services Company (NWSSSC) Pty.

Argon has a better insulation power than nitrogen, which could save 10% of boil-off gas.<ref name=\"NWSSSC membrane tanks\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=GTT NO 96 Technology|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzOZ7rot2fk|publisher=Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) via YouTube|date=Nov 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===CS1===\nCS1 stands for Combined System Number One.

The primary and secondary insulation consists of polyurethane foam panels.\n\nThree vessels with CS1 technology have been built by one shipyard, but established shipyards have decided to maintain production of the MKIII and NO96.\n\n==Reliquefaction and boil-off==\nIn order to facilitate transport, [[natural gas]] is cooled down to approximately {{convert|\u2212163|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at atmospheric pressure, at which point the gas condenses to a liquid. The tanks on board an LNG carrier effectively function as giant [[thermos flask|thermos]]es to keep the liquid gas cold during storage. No insulation is perfect, however, and so the liquid is constantly boiling during the voyage.\n\nAccording to WGI, on a typical voyage an estimated 0.1\u20130.25% of the cargo converts to gas each day, depending on the efficiency of the insulation and the roughness of the voyage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" >World Gas Intelligence, 30 July 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Term |url=https://www.wartsila.com/encyclopedia/term/boil-off-gas-(bog) |website=[[Wartsila]] Encyclopedia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813163643/https://www.wartsila.com/encyclopedia/term/boil-off-gas-(bog) |archivedate=13 August 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> In a typical 20-day voyage, anywhere from 2\u20136% of the total volume of LNG originally loaded may be lost.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nNormally an LNG tanker is powered by steam turbines with boilers. These boilers are dual fuel and can run on either methane or oil or a combination of both.\n\nThe gas produced in boil off is traditionally diverted to the boilers and used as a fuel for the vessel. Before this gas is used in the boilers, it must be warmed up to roughly 20&nbsp;\u00b0C by using the gas heaters. The gas is either fed into the boiler by tank pressure or it is increased in pressure by the LD compressors.\n\nWhat fuel the vessel runs on is dependent on many factors which include the length of the voyage, desire to carry a heel for cooldown, price of oil versus price of LNG, and [[MARPOL 73/78|port demands for cleaner exhaust]].\n\nThere are three basic modes available:\n\n'''Minimum boil-off/maximum oil''':- In this mode tank pressures are kept high to reduce boil off to a minimum and the majority of energy comes from the fuel oil. This maximises the amount of LNG delivered but does allow tank temps to rise due to lack of evaporation. The high cargo temps can cause storage problems and offloading problems.\n\n'''Maximum boil-off/minimum oil''':- In this mode the tank pressures are kept low and you have a greater boil-off but still there is a large amount of fuel oil used. This decreases the amount of LNG delivered but the cargo will be delivered cold which many ports prefer.\n\n'''100% gas''':- Tank pressures are kept at a similar level to max boil off but this is not enough to supply all the boilers needs so you must start to \"force\". A small pump is started in one tank to supply LNG to the forcing vaporiser, where the LNG is warmed and vaporized back into a gas that is usable in the boilers. In this mode no fuel oil is used.\n\nRecent advances in technology reliquefication plants to be fitted to vessels, allowing the boil off to be reliquefied and returned to the tanks. Because of this, the vessels' operators and builders have been able to contemplate the use of more efficient slow-speed [[diesel engine]]s (previously most LNG carriers have been [[steam turbine]]-powered). Exceptions are the LNG carrier ''Havfru'' (built as ''Venator'' in 1973), which originally had dual fuel diesel engines, and its sister-ship ''Century'' (built as ''Lucian'' in 1974), also built with dual fuel gas turbines before being converted to a diesel engine system in 1982.\n\nVessels using Dual or Tri-Fuel Diesel Electric, respectively DFDE e TFDE, propulsion systems are now in service.\n\n== Consequences of spillage ==\n\nWhile no measures exist to prevent all accidents, several past major petrochemical spills, such as the [[Exxon Valdez]] or the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Deepwater Horizon]] oil drilling rig spills, have caused a sense of rising concern within the industry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nCompared to oil, there is less public concern over spillage of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) carrying vessels. The LNG sector is known to have a good safety record regarding [[Cargo ship|cargo]] loss.

As the LNG market grows rapidly,<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/global/lngmarket.html The Global Liquefied Natural Gas Market: Status and Outlook]</ref> the fleet of LNG carriers continues to experience tremendous growth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Delivered LNG.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of new build rate.]]\n\nThe first LNG carrier ''[[Methane Pioneer]]'' ({{DWT|5034}}) left the Calcasieu River on the Louisiana Gulf coast on 25 January 1959. Carrying the world's first ocean cargo of LNG, it sailed to the UK where the cargo was delivered. Subsequent expansion of that trade has brought on a large expansion of the fleet to today where giant LNG ships carrying up to {{convert|266,000|m3|abbr=on}} are sailing worldwide.\n\nThe success of the specially modified C1-M-AV1-type standard ship ''Normarti'', renamed ''Methane Pioneer'', caused the Gas Council and Conch International Methane Ltd. to order two purpose built LNG carriers to be constructed: ''Methane Princess'' and ''Methane Progress''. The ships were fitted with Conch independent aluminum cargo tanks and entered the Algerian LNG trade in 1964. These ships had a capacity of {{convert|27,000|m3}}.\n\nIn the late 1960s, opportunity arose to export LNG from [[Alaska]] to [[Japan]], and in 1969 that trade with [[Tokyo Electric Power Company|TEPCO]] and [[Tokyo Gas]] was initiated. Two ships, ''Polar Alaska'' and ''Arctic Tokyo'', each with a capacity of {{convert|71,500|m3}}, were built in Sweden. In the early 1970s, the US government encouraged US shipyards to build LNG carriers, and a total of 16 LNG ships were built. The late 1970s and early 1980s brought the prospect of Arctic LNG ships with a number of projects being studied.\n\nWith the increase in cargo capacity to approximately {{convert|143,000|m3}}, new tank designs were developed, from Moss Rosenberg to Technigaz Mark III and Gaztransport No.96.\n\nIn recent years, the size and capacity of LNG carriers has increased greatly.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ulvestad|first1= Marte|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2012|title= Natural gas and CO2 price variation: Impact on the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipelines|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261221877_Natural_gas_and_CO2_price_variation_Impact_on_the_relative_cost-efficiency_of_LNG_and_pipelines|journal=\"International Journal of Environmental Studies\"|volume=69|issue=3|pages=407\u2013426}}</ref> Since 2005, Qatargas has pioneered the development of two new classes of LNG carriers, referred to as [[Q-Flex]] and [[Q-Max]].

The new contracts would boost the global LNG fleet by 10%. Of the global fleet, historically, about two-thirds of the ships have been built by South Koreans, 22% by Japanese, 7% by Chinese, and the rest built by a combination of France, Spain, and the United States. South Korea's success stems from innovation and price point; South Korean builders introduced the first ice-breaker type LNG vessels and South Korean builders have been successful in catering to increased customer preference for Q-max vessels over Moss type.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lng-south-korea-shipping/south-korean-shipbuilders-lock-on-lng-tanker-market-to-hold-for-years-idUSKCN1NP001|title=South Korean shipbuilders' lock on LNG tanker market to hold for years|publisher=Reuters|author=Jane Chung, Yuka Obayashi|date=November 19, 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 South Koreas's first LNG powered bulk carrier (Green Iris) will begin construction.

Surrounding the tanks is a combination of [[ballast tank]]s, [[Cofferdam#Naval architecture|cofferdams]] and voids; in effect, this gives the vessel a double-hull type design.\n\nInside each tank there are typically three submerged pumps. There are two main cargo pumps which are used in cargo discharge operations and a much smaller pump which is referred to as the spray pump. The spray pump is used for either pumping out liquid LNG to be used as fuel (via a vaporizer), or for cooling down cargo tanks. It can also be used for \"stripping\" out the last of the cargo in discharge operations. All of these pumps are contained within what is known as the pump tower which hangs from the top of the tank and runs the entire depth of the tank. The pump tower also contains the tank gauging system and the tank filling line, all of which are located near the bottom of the tank.\n\nIn membrane-type vessels there is also an empty pipe with a spring-loaded foot valve that can be opened by weight or pressure. This is the emergency pump tower. In the event both main cargo pumps fail the top can be removed from this pipe and an emergency cargo pump lowered down to the bottom of the pipe. The top is replaced on the column and then the pump is allowed to push down on the foot valve and open it. The cargo can then be pumped out.\n\nAll cargo pumps discharge into a common pipe which runs along the deck of the vessel; it branches off to either side of the vessel to the cargo manifolds, which are used for loading or discharging.\n\nAll cargo tank vapour spaces are linked via a vapour header which runs parallel to the cargo header. This also has connections to the sides of the ship next to the loading and discharging manifolds.\n\n==Typical cargo cycle==\nA typical cargo cycle starts with the tanks in a \"gas free\" condition, meaning the tanks are full of air, which allows maintenance on the tank and pumps. Cargo cannot be loaded directly into the tank, as the presence of oxygen would create an explosive atmospheric condition within the tank, and the rapid temperature change caused by loading LNG at {{convert|\u2212162|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} could damage the tanks.\n\nFirst, the tank must be 'inerted' to eliminate the risk of explosion. An inert gas plant burns diesel in air to produce a mixture of gases (typically less than 5% O2 and about 13% CO<sub>2</sub> plus N<sub>2</sub>). This is blown into the tanks until the oxygen level is below 4%.\n\nNext, the vessel goes into port to \"gas-up\" and \"cool-down\", as one still cannot load directly into the tank: The CO<sub>2</sub> will freeze and damage the pumps and the cold shock could damage the tank's pump column.\n\nLNG is brought onto the vessel and taken along the spray line to the main vaporiser, which boils off the liquid into gas. This is then warmed up to roughly {{convert|20|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in the gas heaters and then blown into the tanks to displace the \"inert gas\". This continues until all the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the tanks. Initially, the IG (inert gas) is vented to atmosphere. Once the hydrocarbon content reaches 5% (lower flammability range of methane) the inert gas is redirected to shore via a pipeline and manifold connection by the HD (high duty) compressors. The shore terminal then burns this vapour to avoid the dangers of having large amounts of hydrocarbons present which may explode.\n\nNow the vessel is gassed up and warm. The tanks are still at ambient temperature and are full of methane.\n\nThe next stage is cool-down. LNG is sprayed into the tanks via spray heads, which vaporises and starts to cool the tank. The excess gas is again blown ashore to be re-liquified or burned at a [[gas flare|flare stack]]. Once the tanks reach about {{convert|\u2212140|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} the tanks are ready to bulk load.\n\nBulk loading starts and liquid LNG is pumped from the storage tanks ashore into the vessel tanks. Displaced gas is blown ashore by the HD compressors. Loading continues until typically 98.5% full is reached (to allow for thermal expansion/contraction of cargo).\n\nThe vessel can now proceed to the discharge port. During passage various boil-off management strategies can be used. Boil-off gas can be burned in boilers to provide propulsion, or it can be re-liquefied and returned to the cargo tanks, depending on the design of the vessel.\n\nOnce in the discharge port, the cargo is pumped ashore using the cargo pumps. As the tank empties, the vapour space is filled by either gas from ashore or by vaporising some cargo in the cargo vaporiser. Either the vessel can be pumped out as far as possible, with the last being pumped out with spray pumps, or some cargo can be retained on board as a \"heel\".\n\nIt is normal practice to keep onboard 5% to 10%{{Citation needed|reason=Some other sources state up to an order of magnitude less than this quantity as the amount required for cool-down.|date=March 2014}} of the cargo after discharge in one tank. This is referred to as the heel and this is used to cool down the remaining tanks that have no heel before loading. This must be done gradually otherwise the tanks will be cold shocked if loaded directly into warm tanks. Cool-down can take roughly 20<ref>GIIGNL Fourth Edition 2.6.2</ref> hours on a Moss vessel (and 10\u201312 hours on a membrane type vessel), so carrying a heel allows cool-down to be done before the vessel reaches port giving a significant time saving.\n\nIf all the cargo is pumped ashore, then on the ballast passage the tanks will warm up to ambient temperature, returning the vessel to a gassed up and warm state. The vessel can then be cooled again for loading.\n\nIf the vessel is to return to a gas free state, the tanks must be warmed up by using the gas heaters to circulate warm gas. Once the tanks are warmed up, the inert gas plant is used to remove the methane from the tanks. Once the tanks are methane free, the inert gas plant is switched to dry air production, which is used to remove all the inert gas from the tanks until they have a safe working atmosphere.\n\nTransportation of natural gas both in the form of LNG and by pipeline causes greenhouse gas emissions, but in different ways. With pipelines, most of the emissions stem from the production of steel pipe; with LNG most of the emissions stem from liquefaction. For both pipelines and LNG, propulsion causes additional emissions (pressurization of the pipeline, propulsion of the LNG tanker).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ulvestad|first=Marte|last2=Overland|first2=Indra|date=2012|title=Natural Gas and CO2 price variation: Impact on the relative cost-efficiency of LNG and pipelines|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261221877|journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies|volume=69|pages=407\u2013426|via=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261221877}}</ref>\n\n==Containment systems==\n[[File:LNGtanker.jpg|thumb|The inside of a Moss-type LNG carrier]]\n\nToday there are four containment systems in use for new build vessels. Two of the designs are of the self-supporting type, while the other two are of the membrane type and today the patents are owned by [[Gaztransport & Technigaz]] (GTT).\n\nThere is a trend towards the use of the two different membrane types instead of the self-supporting storage systems. This is most likely because prismatic membrane tanks utilize the hull shape more efficiently and thus have less void space between the cargo-tanks and ballast tanks. As a result of this, Moss-type design compared to a membrane design of equal capacity will be far more expensive to transit the [[Suez Canal]]. However, self-supporting tanks are more robust and have greater resistance to sloshing forces, and will possibly be considered in the future for offshore storage where bad weather will be a significant factor.\n\n===Moss tanks (Spherical IMO type B LNG tanks)===\n[[File:LNG tanker (side view).PNG|thumb|right|LNG Moss-type tanker, side view]]\nNamed after the company that designed them, the Norwegian company Moss Maritime, the Spherical IMO type B LNG tanks are spherical in shape. Most Moss type vessels have 4 or 5 tanks.\n\nThe outside of the tank has a thick layer of foam insulation that is either fitted in panels or in more modern designs wound round the tank. Over this insulation is a thin layer of \"tinfoil\" which allows the insulation to be kept dry with a nitrogen atmosphere. This atmosphere is constantly checked for any methane that would indicate a leak of the tank. Also the outside of the tank is checked at 3-month intervals for any cold spots that would indicate breakdown in the insulation.\n\nThe tank is supported around its circumference by the equatorial ring, which is supported by a large circular skirt, known as a data-couple that is a unique combination of aluminum and steel, which takes the weight of the tank down to the ships structure. This skirt allows the tank to expand and contract during cool-down and warm-up operations. During cool-down or warm-up the tank can expand or contract about {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}. Because of this expansion and contraction all piping into the tank comes in the top and is connected to the ships lines via flexible bellows.\n\nInside each tank there is a set of spray heads. These heads are mounted around the equatorial ring and are used to spray Liquid LNG onto the tank walls to reduce the temperature.\n\nTanks normally have a working pressure of up to {{convert|22|kPa|abbr=on}}, but this can be raised for an emergency discharge. If both main pumps fail then to remove the cargo, the tank's safety valves are adjusted to lift at 100 kPa. Then the filling line which goes to the bottom of the tank is opened along with the filling lines of the other tanks on board. The pressure is then raised in the tank with the defective pumps which pushes the cargo into the other tanks where it can be pumped out.\n\n===IHI (Prismatic IMO type B LNG tanks)===\nDesigned by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, the ''self-supporting prismatic type B (SPB)'' tank is currently employed in only two vessels. Type B tanks limit sloshing problems, an improvement over Membrane LNG carrier tanks which may break due to sloshing impact, therefore destroying the ship's hull. This is also of prime relevance for [[Floating production storage and offloading|FPSO]] LNG (or FLNG).\n\nIn addition, IMO type B LNG tanks can sustain internal accidental damage due for example to internal equipment releases. This was incorporated into the design following several incidents that occurred inside membrane LNG tanks.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===TGZ Mark III===\n[[File:Liquid natural gas membrane tank.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Interior of a non-spherical, Technigaz Mark III stainless steel membrane, LNG tank]]\nDesigned by [[Gaztransport & Technigaz|Technigaz]], these tanks are of the membrane type. The membrane consists of stainless steel with 'waffles' to absorb the thermal contraction when the tank is cooled down.  The primary barrier, made of corrugated stainless steel of about {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on}} thickness is the one in direct contact with the cargo liquid (or vapour in empty tank condition). This is followed by a primary insulation which in turn is covered by a secondary barrier made of a material called \"triplex\" which is basically a metal foil sandwiched between glasswool sheets and compressed together. This is again covered by a secondary insulation which in turn is supported by the ship's hull structure from the outside.<ref>{{cite web|title=GTT Mark III Technology|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ghACzdfnak|publisher=Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) via YouTube|date=Nov 7, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"NWSSSC membrane tanks\">{{cite web|title=Membrane Containment System|url=http://www.nwsssc.com/fleet/ship-technical-information/membrane-containment-system|publisher=North West Shelf Shipping Services Company (NWSSSC) Pty.

Argon has a better insulation power than nitrogen, which could save 10% of boil-off gas.<ref name=\"NWSSSC membrane tanks\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=GTT NO 96 Technology|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzOZ7rot2fk|publisher=Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) via YouTube|date=Nov 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===CS1===\nCS1 stands for Combined System Number One. It was designed by the now merged [[Gaztransport & Technigaz]] companies and consists of the best components of both MkIII and No96 systems. The primary barrier is made of invar {{convert|0.7|mm|abbr=on}}, and secondary from Triplex. The primary and secondary insulation consists of polyurethane foam panels.\n\nThree vessels with CS1 technology have been built by one shipyard, but established shipyards have decided to maintain production of the MKIII and NO96.\n\n==Reliquefaction and boil-off==\nIn order to facilitate transport, [[natural gas]] is cooled down to approximately {{convert|\u2212163|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at atmospheric pressure, at which point the gas condenses to a liquid. The tanks on board an LNG carrier effectively function as giant [[thermos flask|thermos]]es to keep the liquid gas cold during storage. No insulation is perfect, however, and so the liquid is constantly boiling during the voyage.\n\nAccording to WGI, on a typical voyage an estimated 0.1\u20130.25% of the cargo converts to gas each day, depending on the efficiency of the insulation and the roughness of the voyage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" >World Gas Intelligence, 30 July 2008</ref> In a typical 20-day voyage, anywhere from 2\u20136% of the total volume of LNG originally loaded may be lost.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nNormally an LNG tanker is powered by steam turbines with boilers. These boilers are dual fuel and can run on either methane or oil or a combination of both.\n\nThe gas produced in boil off is traditionally diverted to the boilers and used as a fuel for the vessel. Before this gas is used in the boilers, it must be warmed up to roughly 20&nbsp;\u00b0C by using the gas heaters. The gas is either fed into the boiler by tank pressure or it is increased in pressure by the LD compressors.\n\nWhat fuel the vessel runs on is dependent on many factors which include the length of the voyage, desire to carry a heel for cooldown, price of oil versus price of LNG.\n\nThere are three basic modes available:\n\n'''Minimum boil-off/maximum oil''':- In this mode tank pressures are kept high to reduce boil off to a minimum and the majority of energy comes from the fuel oil. This maximises the amount of LNG delivered but does allow tank temps to rise due to lack of evaporation. The high cargo temps can cause storage problems and offloading problems.\n\n'''Maximum boil-off/minimum oil''':- In this mode the tank pressures are kept low and you have a greater boil-off but still there is a large amount of fuel oil used. This decreases the amount of LNG delivered but the cargo will be delivered cold which many ports prefer.\n\n'''100% gas''':- Tank pressures are kept at a similar level to max boil off but this is not enough to supply all the boilers needs so you must start to \"force\". A small pump is started in one tank to supply LNG to the forcing vaporiser, where the LNG is warmed and vaporized back into a gas that is usable in the boilers. In this mode no fuel oil is used.\n\nRecent advances in technology reliquefication plants to be fitted to vessels, allowing the boil off to be reliquefied and returned to the tanks. Because of this, the vessels' operators and builders have been able to contemplate the use of more efficient slow-speed [[diesel engine]]s (previously most LNG carriers have been [[steam turbine]]-powered).

Bodoni followed the ideas of [[John Baskerville]], as found in the printing type [[Baskerville]]\u2014increased stroke contrast reflecting developing printing technology and a more vertical axis\u2014but he took them to a more extreme conclusion. Bodoni had a long career and his designs changed and varied, ending with a typeface of a slightly condensed underlying structure with flat, unbracketed serifs, extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, and an overall geometric construction.<ref>Arntson, A. (1988). Graphic design basics. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, p.92.</ref>\n\nWhen first released, Bodoni and other didone fonts were called classical designs because of their rational structure. However, these fonts were not updated versions of Roman or Renaissance letter styles, but new designs. They came to be called 'modern' serif fonts; since the mid-20th century, they are also known as Didone designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-1/type-anatomy/type-classifications|title=Type Classifications|work=Fonts.com}}</ref>\n\nSome digital versions of Bodoni are said to be hard to read due to \"dazzle\" caused by the alternating thick and thin strokes, particularly as the thin strokes are very thin at small point sizes. This is very common when [[Typeface#optical sizing|optical sizes]] of font intended for use at display sizes are printed at text size, at which point the hairline strokes can recede to being hard to see. Versions of Bodoni that are intended to be used at text size are \"Bodoni Old Face\", optimized for 9 points; ITC Bodoni 12 (for 12 points); and ITC Bodoni 6 (for 6 points).\n\n[[Massimo Vignelli]] stated that \"Bodoni is one of the most elegant typefaces ever designed.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=14398|title=Interview with Massimo Vignelli|work=Design Observer}}</ref> In the English-speaking world, \"modern\" serif designs like Bodoni are most commonly used in headings and display uses and in upmarket magazine printing, which is often done on high-gloss paper that retains and sets off the crisp detail of the fine strokes. In Europe, they are more often used in body text.\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[File:Manuale-Tipografico1.jpg|thumb|The 1818 Manuale-Tipografico specimen manual of Bodoni's press, published after his death.]]\nBodoni admired the work of John Baskerville<ref>Loxley, S. (2004). Type. London: I.B. Tauris, p.63.</ref> and studied in detail the designs of French type founders [[Pierre Simon Fournier]] and [[Firmin Didot]]. Although he drew inspiration from the work of these designers,<ref>''http://www.designmylife.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bodonitypespecimen.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107192316/http://www.designmylife.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bodonitypespecimen.pdf |date=2016-11-07 }}</ref> above all from Didot, no doubt Bodoni found his own style for his typefaces, which deservedly gained worldwide acceptance among printers.\n\nAlthough to a modern audience Bodoni is best known as the name of a typeface, Bodoni was an expert printer who ran a prestigious printing-office under the patronage of the Duke of Parma, and the design of his type was permitted by and showcased the quality of his company's work in metal-casting, printing and of the paper made in Parma.<ref name=\"A Sketch of a Tour on the Continent, in the Years 1786 and 1787\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=James Edward|title=A Sketch of a Tour on the Continent, in the Years 1786 and 1787|date=1793|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/asketchatouronc01smitgoog/page/n346 36]\u201338|url=https://archive.org/details/asketchatouronc01smitgoog|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> The hairline serifs and fine strokes reflected a high quality of casting, since on poor-quality printing equipment serifs had to be large to avoid wear snapping them.<ref name=\"Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing\">{{cite book|last1=Hansard|first1=Thomas Curson|title=Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing|date=1825|page=[https://archive.org/details/typographiaanhi01hansgoog/page/n432 370]|url=https://archive.org/details/typographiaanhi01hansgoog|accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref> The smooth finish of his paper allowed fine detail to be retained on the surface. Bodoni also took care in the composition of his printing, using hierarchy and borders to create an appearance of elegance, and his range of type sizes allowed him flexibility of composition.\n\nWriting of meeting him in the year 1786, [[James Edward Smith]] said:\n\n<blockquote>A very great curiosity in its way is the Parma printing-office, carried on under the direction of Mr. Bodoni, who has brought that art to a degree of perfection scarcely known before him. Nothing could exceed his civility in showing us numbers of the beautiful productions of his press...as well as the operations of casting and finishing the letters...his paper is all made \nat Parma. The manner in which Mr. Bodoni gives his works their beautiful smoothness, so that no impression of the letters is perceptible on either side, is the only part of his business that he keeps secret.<ref name=\"A Sketch of a Tour on the Continent, in the Years 1786 and 1787\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe effective use of Bodoni in modern printing poses challenges common to all Didone designs.

Bodoni followed the ideas of [[John Baskerville]], as found in the printing type [[Baskerville]]\u2014increased stroke contrast reflecting developing printing technology and a more vertical axis\u2014but he took them to a more extreme conclusion. Bodoni had a long career and his designs changed and varied, ending with a typeface of a slightly condensed underlying structure with flat, unbracketed serifs, extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, and an overall geometric construction.<ref>Arntson, A. (1988). Graphic design basics. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, p.92.</ref>\n\nWhen first released, Bodoni and other didone fonts were called classical designs because of their rational structure. However, these fonts were not updated versions of Roman or Renaissance letter styles, but new designs. They came to be called 'modern' serif fonts; since the mid-20th century, they are also known as Didone designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-1/type-anatomy/type-classifications|title=Type Classifications|work=Fonts.com}}</ref>\n\nSome digital versions of Bodoni are said to be hard to read due to \"dazzle\" caused by the alternating thick and thin strokes, particularly as the thin strokes are very thin at small point sizes. This is very common when [[Typeface#optical sizing|optical sizes]] of font intended for use at display sizes are printed at text size, at which point the hairline strokes can recede to being hard to see. Versions of Bodoni that are intended to be used at text size are \"Bodoni Old Face\", optimized for 9 points; ITC Bodoni 12 (for 12 points); and ITC Bodoni 6 (for 6 points).\n\n[[Massimo Vignelli]] stated that \"Bodoni is one of the most elegant typefaces ever designed.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=14398|title=Interview with Massimo Vignelli|work=Design Observer}}</ref> In the English-speaking world, \"modern\" serif designs like Bodoni are most commonly used in headings and display uses and in upmarket magazine printing, which is often done on high-gloss paper that retains and sets off the crisp detail of the fine strokes. In Europe, they are more often used in body text.\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[File:Manuale-Tipografico1.jpg|thumb|The 1818 Manuale-Tipografico specimen manual of Bodoni's press, published after his death.]]\nBodoni admired the work of John Baskerville<ref>Loxley, S. (2004). Type. London: I.B. Tauris, p.63.</ref> and studied in detail the designs of French type founders [[Pierre Simon Fournier]] and [[Firmin Didot]]. Although he drew inspiration from the work of these designers,<ref>''http://www.designmylife.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bodonitypespecimen.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107192316/http://www.designmylife.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bodonitypespecimen.pdf |date=2016-11-07 }}</ref> above all from Didot, no doubt Bodoni found his own style for his typefaces, which deservedly gained worldwide acceptance among printers.\n\nAlthough to a modern audience Bodoni is best known as the name of a typeface, Bodoni was an expert printer who ran a prestigious printing-office under the patronage of the Duke of Parma, and the design of his type was permitted by and showcased the quality of his company's work in metal-casting, printing and of the paper made in Parma.<ref name=\"A Sketch of a Tour on the Continent, in the Years 1786 and 1787\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=James Edward|title=A Sketch of a Tour on the Continent, in the Years 1786 and 1787|date=1793|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/asketchatouronc01smitgoog/page/n346 36]\u201338|url=https://archive.org/details/asketchatouronc01smitgoog|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref> The hairline serifs and fine strokes reflected a high quality of casting, since on poor-quality printing equipment serifs had to be large to avoid wear snapping them.<ref name=\"Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing\">{{cite book|last1=Hansard|first1=Thomas Curson|title=Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing|date=1825|page=[https://archive.org/details/typographiaanhi01hansgoog/page/n432 370]|url=https://archive.org/details/typographiaanhi01hansgoog|accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref> The smooth finish of his paper allowed fine detail to be retained on the surface. Bodoni also took care in the composition of his printing, using hierarchy and borders to create an appearance of elegance, and his range of type sizes allowed him flexibility of composition.\n\nWriting of meeting him in the year 1786, [[James Edward Smith]] said:\n\n<blockquote>A very great curiosity in its way is the Parma printing-office, carried on under the direction of Mr. Bodoni, who has brought that art to a degree of perfection scarcely known before him. Nothing could exceed his civility in showing us numbers of the beautiful productions of his press...as well as the operations of casting and finishing the letters...his paper is all made \nat Parma. The manner in which Mr. Bodoni gives his works their beautiful smoothness, so that no impression of the letters is perceptible on either side, is the only part of his business that he keeps secret.<ref name=\"A Sketch of a Tour on the Continent, in the Years 1786 and 1787\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe effective use of Bodoni in modern printing poses challenges common to all Didone designs. While it can look very elegant due to the regular, rational design and fine strokes, a known effect on readers is 'dazzle', where the thick verticals draw the reader's attention and cause them to struggle to concentrate on the other, much thinner strokes that define which letter is which.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Berkson|first1=William|title=Reviving Caslon, Part 2|url=http://ilovetypography.com/2010/11/02/reviving-caslon-part-2-readability-affability-authority/|website=I Love Typography|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref><ref>Cees W.

The overall sound of the album is slightly flat and compressed, to give a similar sound to the varying productions of each track which are taken from the albums between the years 1974 up to 1977. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe Japanese single release of \"Strutter '78\" includes a different version to that on the album: faster and shorter, with an altered guitar solo, plus a more prominent hi-hat (cymbal) sound throughout.\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{album reviews\n|rev1=[[Allmusic]]|rev1Score={{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11061}}</ref>\n|rev2=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|rev2Score=(6.0/10)<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030626070731/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/k/kiss/double-platinum.shtml|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/k/kiss/double-platinum.shtml |archivedate=2003-06-26| title=Kiss: Double Platinum: Pitchfork Review |work=pitchforkmedia.com |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>\n|rev3=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|rev3Score={{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/kiss |title=Kiss &#124; Rolling Stone Music |work=rollingstone.com |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>\n|noprose=yes\n}}\nThe original vinyl release, in a gatefold-sleeve, had an embossed, silver-foiled sleeve, with the band members in [[bas-relief]] inside. The album was packaged with a printed \"Platinum Award\" thanking the Kiss Army for making the band a \"Double Platinum Success\". Later reissues would retain the gatefold-sleeve but replaced the logo with a printed, red-type version and the band members were now represented inside by photos rather than the ''bas'' illustrations.

The overall sound of the album is slightly flat and compressed, to give a similar sound to the varying productions of each track which are taken from the albums between the years 1974 up to 1977. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe Japanese single release of \"Strutter '78\" includes a different version to that on the album: faster and shorter, with an altered guitar solo, plus a more prominent hi-hat (cymbal) sound throughout.\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{album reviews\n|rev1=[[Allmusic]]|rev1Score={{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11061}}</ref>\n|rev2=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|rev2Score=(6.0/10)<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030626070731/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/k/kiss/double-platinum.shtml|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/k/kiss/double-platinum.shtml |archivedate=2003-06-26| title=Kiss: Double Platinum: Pitchfork Review |work=pitchforkmedia.com |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>\n|rev3=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|rev3Score={{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/kiss |title=Kiss &#124; Rolling Stone Music |work=rollingstone.com |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>\n|noprose=yes\n}}\nThe original vinyl release, in a gatefold-sleeve, had an embossed, silver-foiled sleeve, with the band members in [[bas-relief]] inside. The album was packaged with a printed \"Platinum Award\" thanking the Kiss Army for making the band a \"Double Platinum Success\". Later reissues would retain the gatefold-sleeve but replaced the logo with a printed, red-type version and the band members were now represented inside by photos rather than the ''bas'' illustrations.
