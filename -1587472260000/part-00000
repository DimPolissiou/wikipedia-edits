After turning professional later that year, he defeated [[Chris Byrd]] in 2000 to win the WBO heavyweight title. Klitschko's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to [[Corrie Sanders]] in 2003, which was followed by another knockout loss to [[Lamon Brewster]] in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired [[Emanuel Steward]] as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward's death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko's transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with [[Lennox Lewis]] in 1995 to 2003.\n\nIn 2006, Klitschko regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after defeating Chris Byrd in a rematch to win the IBF and IBO titles. He won the WBO title for a second time by defeating [[Sultan Ibragimov]] in 2008. Following his defeat of [[Ruslan Chagaev]] in 2009, Klitschko was awarded ''The Ring'' title, and lastly he won the WBA title from [[David Haye]] in 2011.

After turning professional later that year, he defeated [[Chris Byrd]] in 2000 to win the WBO heavyweight title. Klitschko's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to [[Corrie Sanders]] in 2003, which was followed by another knockout loss to [[Lamon Brewster]] in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired [[Emanuel Steward]] as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward's death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko's transition from an aggressive puncher to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with [[Lennox Lewis]] in 1995 to 2003.\n\nIn 2006, Klitschko regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship after defeating Chris Byrd in a rematch to win the IBF and IBO titles. He won the WBO title for a second time by defeating [[Sultan Ibragimov]] in 2008. Following his defeat of [[Ruslan Chagaev]] in 2009, Klitschko was awarded ''The Ring'' title, and lastly he won the WBA title from [[David Haye]] in 2011.

{"title_page": "Infantry mobility vehicle", "text_new": "[[Image:Dingo_2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[ATF Dingo]] of the [[German Army]] is a well-protected infantry mobility vehicle used by several European armed forces]]\n\nAn '''infantry mobility vehicle''' (IMV) is a wheeled [[armored personnel carrier]] (APC) serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle.  Examples include the [[ATF Dingo]], [[Iveco LMV]], [[Oshkosh M-ATV]], [[AMZ Dzik]], [[AMZ Tur]], [[Mungo ESK]], and [[Bushmaster IMV]]. This term also applies to those vehicles fielded as part of the [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAP program]]. \n\nIMVs were developed in response to the threats of modern warfare, with an emphasis on crew protection and mine-resistance. Similar vehicles existed long before the term IMV was coined, such as the French [[V\u00e9hicule de l'Avant Blind\u00e9| VAB]] and South African [[Buffel]]. The term is coming more into use to differentiate light 4x4 wheeled APCs from the traditional 8x8 wheeled APCs. The up-armored [[M1114]] Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn 1994, the Australian Department of Defence identified the need to mobilise infantry through the acquisition of unprotected and protected vehicles.  <ref>Australian National Audit Office \"Defence's Project Bushranger: Acquisition of Infantry Mobility Vehicles\". Archived from the original on 2006-09-17.</ref>  This eventually led to the development of the Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicle, later referred to as the [[Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle]].\n\n==History== \nInfantry Mobility Vehicles were first found during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].  In response to the growing threat of mines, a number of \"Mine Ambush Protected\" vehicles were produced in an improvised manner for Rhodesian government forces in unit workshops and national steel working firms from about 1972<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180709011219/http://weaponsman.com/?p=27146</ref>.  Similar units were developed by South Africa, such as the [[Casspir]].\n\nThe [[Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicle]] was designed for the Australian military in the 1990s and hundreds of vehicles entered service.  \n\nIn response to the increased threat of IEDs in the [[Global War on Terror]], a large number of IMVs were acquired by belligerents.  In 2002, the United States Marine Corps began deploying [[Cougar (MRAP)|Cougars]] built by Force Protection for use in Afghanistan.  Thousands of units have been ordered as part of the American [[Mine Resistant Ambush Protected]] and [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]] programs, respectively.  IMVs were deployed extensively by ISAF forces in Afghanistan.  They have were deployed by the US, UK, and Australia during the [[Iraq War]].\n\nIn 2018, [[Peshmerga]] forces in Syria were seen in American built IMVs<ref>https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2018/05/08/us-backed-syrian-fighters-spotted-in-mraps-prior-to-isis-assault/</ref>.\n\n==Purpose==\nInfantry Mobility Vehicles are designed to supplant lighter, less protected vehicles among rear echelon troops and in low intensity conflict.  They are a more protected alternative to jeeps and medium trucks in patrol and transportation roles.  They are designed to counter mines and ambushes; these include sporadic small arms fire, threats such as IEDs and anti-tank mines, and man portable anti tank weapons such as the [[RPG-7]].\n\n==Design==\nInfantry Mobility Vehicles share similar design to the trucks they are designed to replace.  The front and side windshields will be made of [[ballistic glass]].  They generally feature a [[v-hull]] shaped underbelly with additional crew protection features such as four- point seat belts and seats suspended from the roof or sides of the vehicle.   IMVs are resistant to small arms and explosives but aren't designed to defeat heavy machine gun and cannon fire, or shaped charge attack.\n\nInfantry Mobility Vehicles carry weapons typical of [[armoured personnel carrier]]s.  Many feature a machine gun on the roof, either on a ring mount or a [[remote weapon system]].\n\nIMVs are typically designed to have much greater protection from IEDs than other armoured vehicles, with crews able to survive blasts that would be lethal in more conventional [[armoured personnel carriers]].  They are typically much heavier than unarmoured vehicles, with weight typically greater than six tonnes, and ranging to as much as thirty.  \n\nBeing designed for patrol and transportation rather than direct combat, they are designed to have good on road mobility.  They are often capable of road speeds approaching or exceeding 100km/h, high for an armoured vehicle.

Examples include the [[ATF Dingo]], [[Iveco LMV]], [[Oshkosh M-ATV]], [[AMZ Dzik]], [[AMZ Tur]], [[Mungo ESK]], and [[Bushmaster IMV]]. This term also applies to those vehicles fielded as part of the [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAP program]]. \n\nIMVs were developed in response to the threats of modern warfare, with an emphasis on crew protection and mine-resistance. Similar vehicles existed long before the term IMV was coined, such as the French [[V\u00e9hicule de l'Avant Blind\u00e9| VAB]] and South African [[Buffel]]. The term is coming more into use to differentiate light 4x4 wheeled APCs from the traditional 8x8 wheeled APCs. The up-armored [[M1114]] Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn 1994, the Australian Department of Defence identified the need to mobilise infantry through the acquisition of unprotected and protected vehicles.  <ref>Australian National Audit Office \"Defence's Project Bushranger: Acquisition of Infantry Mobility Vehicles\". Archived from the original on 2006-09-17.</ref>  This eventually led to the development of the Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicle, later referred to as the [[Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle]].\n\n==History== \nInfantry Mobility Vehicles were first found during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].  In response to the growing threat of mines, a number of \"Mine Ambush Protected\" vehicles were produced in an improvised manner for Rhodesian government forces in unit workshops and national steel working firms from about 1972<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180709011219/http://weaponsman.com/?p=27146</ref>.  Similar units were developed by South Africa, such as the [[Casspir]].\n\nThe [[Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicle]] was designed for the Australian military in the 1990s and hundreds of vehicles entered service.  \n\nIn response to the increased threat of IEDs in the [[Global War on Terror]], a large number of IMVs were acquired by belligerents.  In 2002, the United States Marine Corps began deploying [[Cougar (MRAP)|Cougars]] built by Force Protection for use in Afghanistan.  Thousands of units have been ordered as part of the American [[Mine Resistant Ambush Protected]] and [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]] programs, respectively.  IMVs were deployed extensively by ISAF forces in Afghanistan.  They have were deployed by the US, UK, and Australia during the [[Iraq War]].\n\nIn 2018, [[Peshmerga]] forces in Syria were seen in American built IMVs<ref>https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2018/05/08/us-backed-syrian-fighters-spotted-in-mraps-prior-to-isis-assault/</ref>.\n\n==Purpose==\nInfantry Mobility Vehicles are designed to supplant lighter, less protected vehicles among rear echelon troops and in low intensity conflict.  They are a more protected alternative to jeeps and medium trucks in patrol and transportation roles.  They are designed to counter mines and ambushes; these include sporadic small arms fire, threats such as IEDs and anti-tank mines, and man portable anti tank weapons such as the [[RPG-7]].\n\n==Design==\nInfantry Mobility Vehicles share similar design to the trucks they are designed to replace.  The front and side windshields will be made of [[ballistic glass]].  They generally feature a [[v-hull]] shaped underbelly with additional crew protection features such as four- point seat belts and seats suspended from the roof or sides of the vehicle.   IMVs are resistant to small arms and explosives but aren't designed to defeat heavy machine gun and cannon fire, or shaped charge attack.\n\nInfantry Mobility Vehicles carry weapons typical of [[armoured personnel carrier]]s.  Many feature a machine gun on the roof, either on a ring mount or a [[remote weapon system]].\n\nIMVs are typically designed to have much greater protection from IEDs than other armoured vehicles, with crews able to survive blasts that would be lethal in more conventional [[armoured personnel carriers]].  They are typically much heavier than unarmoured vehicles, with weight typically greater than six tonnes, and ranging to as much as thirty.  \n\nBeing designed for patrol and transportation rather than direct combat, they are designed to have good on road mobility.  They are often capable of road speeds approaching or exceeding 100km/h, high for an armoured vehicle.  Offroad maneuverability may be limited due to lack of all wheel drive, power to weight, and high ground pressure.\n\nMany are derived from existing truck chassis.

The study inferred that the [[most recent common ancestor]] for all other ''Canis lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 years before present.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> An analysis of the Himalayan wolf mitochondrial genome indicates that the Himalayan wolf diverged between 740,000\u2014691,000 years ago from the lineage that would become the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the Himalayan wolf and Indian grey wolf were genetically closer to the [[African golden wolf]] than they were to the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> From 2017, two studies based on mDNA, and X-chromosome and Y-chromosome markers taken from the [[cell nucleus]], indicate that the Himalayan wolf is genetically basal to the Holarctic grey wolf. Its degree of divergence from the Holarctic grey wolf is similar to the degree of divergence of the African golden wolf from the Holarctic grey wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares a maternal lineage with the African golden wolf. It possesses a unique paternal lineage that falls between the grey wolf and the African golden wolf.<ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> The specimens used in these two studies show the high-elevation range of the Himalayan wolf to include the Himalayas then north across the Tibetan plateau to the [[Qinghai Lake]] in China's Qinghai Province.<ref name=werhahn2017/>\nIn 2018, whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The African golden wolf was found to be the descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72%&nbsp;grey wolf and 28%&nbsp;[[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/> The Ethiopian wolf does not share the single-nucleotide polymorphisms that confer hypoxia adaptation with the Himalayan wolf. The adaptation of the Ethiopian wolf to living in high elevations may occur at other single-nucleotide polymorphism locations. This indicates that the Ethiopian wolf's adaptation has not been inherited by descent from a common ancestor shared with the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Himalayan wolf.JPG|thumb|Himalayan wolf profile]]\nThe Himalayan wolf has a thick woolly fur that is dull earthy-brown on the back and tail, and yellowish-white on the face, belly and limbs. It is about {{convert|45|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} long and {{convert|30|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall at the shoulder.<ref name=hodgson1847/><ref name=blanford1888/><ref name=lydekker1900/><ref name=pocock1941/> It is larger than the [[Indian wolf]].<ref name=jerdon1874/> It has closely-spaced black speckles on the muzzle, below the eyes, on the upper cheeks and ears.<ref name=chetri2016/> It weighs about {{convert|35|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"shrotriya2012\" />\n\nThe heart of the Himalayan wolf withstands the low oxygen level at high elevations. It has a strong selection for RYR2, a gene that initiates cardiac excitation.<ref name=Zhang2014/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Pin Valley, Spiti.jpg|thumb|[[Pin Valley National Park]] located in Himachal Pradesh]]\nIn China, the Himalayan wolf lives on the Tibetan Plateau in the provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Qinghai]], Tibet,<ref name=smith2008/><ref name=wang2003/> and western [[Sichuan]].<ref name=Werhahn2020/>\n\nIn northern India, it occurs in the [[Ladakh]] region of eastern [[Kashmir]]<ref name=lydekker1900/> and in the [[Lahaul and Spiti]] region in northeastern [[Himachal Pradesh]].<ref name=pocock1941/> In 2004, the Himalayan wolf population in India was estimated to consist of 350 individuals ranging across an area of about {{convert|70000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=sharma2004/>\nBetween 2005 and 2008, it was sighted in the alpine meadows above the tree line north-east of [[Nanda Devi National Park]] in [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=bhattacharya2010/> In 2013, a wolf was photographed by a camera trap installed at an elevation of about {{convert|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} near the Sunderdhunga Glacier in  Uttarakhand's [[Bageshwar district]].<ref name=pioneer2014/>\n\nIn Nepal, it was recorded in [[Api Nampa Conservation Area]], Upper [[Dolpo|Dolpa]], [[Holma]], [[Manaslu]], [[Upper Mustang]], and in [[Kanchenjunga Conservation Area]].<ref name=arnold2016/><ref name=werhahn2017b/> The Nepal Himalayas provide an important habitat refuge for the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nThe howls of the Himalayan wolf have lower frequencies and are shorter in duration. These howls are acoustically distinct and differ significantly from each other and from other wolf subspecies.<ref name=\"hennelly2017\"/>\n\n===Prey===\nHimalayan wolves prefer wild over domestic prey. They prefer the smaller [[Tibetan gazelle]] than the larger [[white-lipped deer]], and they prefer the plains-dwelling Tibetan gazelle over the cliff-dwelling [[naur]]. Supplementary food includes the small [[Himalayan marmot]], [[woolly hare]], and [[pikas]]. Himalayan wolves avoided livestock where wild prey is available, however habitat encroachment and the depletion of wild prey populations is forecast to lead to conflict with herders. To protect these wolves it will be important to secure healthy wild prey populations through setting aside wildlife habitat reserves and refuges.<ref name=Werhahn2019/> \n\nHistorical sources indicate that wolves occasionally killed children in Ladakh and [[Lahaul and Spiti|Lahoul]].<ref name=pocock1941/> Within the proposed Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary in Ladakh, the intensity of livestock depredation was assessed in three villages. The assessment found that Tibetan wolves were the most important predators accounting for 60% of the total livestock losses, followed by the [[snow leopard]] and [[Eurasian lynx]]. The most frequent prey were [[domestic goat]]s (32%), followed by sheep (30%), [[yak]]s (15%), and [[horse]]s (13%). The wolves killed horses significantly more, and goats less, than would be expected from their relative abundance.<ref name=fox2007/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Canis lupus himalayensis.JPG|thumb|Wolves in the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling]]\nThe wolf in Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan is listed on [[CITES]] [[CITES Appendix I|Appendix I]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Species+: ''Canis lupus'' |website=CITES Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC |year=2010 |url=https://speciesplus.net/#/taxon_concepts/4442/legal}}</ref>\nIn India, the wolf is protected under Schedule I of the ''[[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]'', which prohibits hunting; a zoo needs a permission from the government to acquire a wolf. It is listed as endangered in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, where a large portion of the wolf population lives outside the protected area network.<ref name=shrotriya2012/> Lack of information about its basic ecology in this landscape is an obstacle for developing a conservation plan.<ref name=habib2013/>\nIn Nepal, it is protected under Schedule I of the ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 2029 (1973)'' prohibiting hunting it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ministry of Forests |year=1973 |title=National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029 (1973) |publisher=Government of Nepal |location=Kathmandu, Nepal |url=http://www.aec-fncci.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/National-Parks-and-Wildlife-Conservation-Act-2029-1973.pdf}}</ref>\nIn China, the wolf is listed as vulnerable in the ''Red List of China\u2019s Vertebrates'', and hunting it is banned.<ref name=xu2015/><ref name=fang2016/>\n\n=== In captivity ===\nIn 2007, 18 Himalayan wolves were kept for breeding in two Indian zoos.

Additionally, the wolf population in the Kashmir valley is known to have recently arrived in that area.<ref name=shrotriya2012/><ref name=chetri2016/> Subsequent genetic research showed that wolf samples from Tibet are [[lineage (genetic)#Basal lineage|genetically basal]] to the [[Holarctic]] [[gray wolf]].<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=aggarwal2007b/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=miklosi2015/><ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=ersmark2016/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> Its [[MT-ND4L]] [[gene]] commences with the [[base pairs]] [[Guanine|G]]TG, whereas all other [[Canidae|canids]] commence with [[Adenine|A]]TG.<ref name=zhao2014/> Results of [[whole genome sequencing]] showed that it is the most [[Genetic divergence|genetically divergent]] wolf.<ref name=fan2016/>\n\nAnalysis of scat samples from two wolves collected in upper [[Dolpo]] matched the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=subba2012/> Fecal remains of four wolves collected in the [[upper Mustang]] region of the [[Annapurna Conservation Area]] also fell within the Himalayan wolf clade but formed a separate haplotype to those previously studied.<ref name=chetri2016/>\n\nThe Himalayan wolf population in Tibet declined over the past 25,000&nbsp;years and suffered a historical [[population bottleneck]]. Glaciation during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] may have caused habitat loss, genetic isolation and ancient inbreeding. On the other hand, the population in Qinghai had grown, showing a [[gene flow]] of 16% from Chinese indigenous dogs and 2% of the dingo's genome. It probably recolonised the Tibetan Plateau.<ref name=fan2016/>\nThe Himalayan wolf contrasts with the wolves living at lower elevations in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Xinjiang]] province. Some wolves in China and Mongolia also fall within the Himalayan wolf clade, indicating a common maternal ancestor and a wide distribution.<ref name=ersmark2016/> There was evidence of [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] with the grey wolf at Sachyat-Ertash in the [[Issyk-Kul]] region of [[Kyrgyzstan]], and of [[introgression]] from either the grey wolf or the dog into the Himalayan wolf in Nepal.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n{{Cladogram|align=left |title=[[Phylogenetic tree]] of the extant wolf-like canids with timing in millions of years{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=mtdna_seq_desc|For a full set of supporting references refer to the note (a) in the phylotree at [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids]]}}|caption=<big>Blue shading represents the species ''Canis lupus''\n</big>\n|cladogram={{clade | style = font-size:85%;line-height:80%;width:550px;\n |label1=[[Caninae]] 3.5&nbsp;[[Megaannum|Ma]]\n |1={{clade\n  |label1=3.0\n  |1={{clade\n   |label1=2.5\n   |1={{clade\n    |label1=2.0\n    |1={{clade\n     |label1=0.96\n     |1={{clade\n       |label1=0.60\n       |1={{clade\n        |label1=0.38 \n        |1={{clade\n        |style1=background-color:#ccccff;\n         |label1=0.25\n         |1={{clade\n          |label1=0.12\n          |1={{clade\n           |label1=0.08\n           |1={{clade\n            |label1=0.031 \n            |1={{clade\n             |1=[[Dog|Domestic dog]] [[File:Tibetan mastiff (transparent background).png|50 px]]\n             |2=Holarctic [[Wolf|grey wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n             }}\n            |2=[[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]]\u2020 [[File:The_American_Museum_journal_(c1900-(1918))_(Canis_dirus)_transparent_background.png|60 px]]\n            }}\n            |2=[[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian plains wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n           }}\n           |2='''Himalayan wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n          }}\n         |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).jpg|50 px]]\n         }}\n        |2={{clade\n         |1=[[African golden wolf]] northwestern Africa[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n         |2=African golden wolf eastern Africa[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n        }}\n        |label2=0.11\n       }}\n       |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).jpg|50 px]]\n       }}\n      |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).jpg|50 px]]\n      }}\n     |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).jpg|50 px]]\n     }}\n     |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).jpg|50 px]]\n   }}\n  |2={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n    |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).jpg|50 px]]\n    |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).jpg|50 px]]\n    }}\n    |label1=2.6\n   }}\n  }}\n }}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n[[DNA sequences]] can be mapped to reveal a [[phylogenetic tree]] that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor.

The Tibetan Mastiff's ability to avoid [[Hypoxic hypoxia|hypoxia]] in high altitudes, due to its higher [[hemoglobin]] levels compared to low-altitude dogs, was due to prehistoric interbreeding with the wolves of Tibet.<ref name=Miao2016/><ref name=Signore2019/>\n\n===Relationship with the African golden wolf===\n[[File:Himalayan wolves.jpg|thumb|Wolves in the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in [[Darjeeling]]]]\nIn 2011, it was proposed that the [[Indian wolf]], Himalayan wolf, and [[African golden wolf]] represent ancient wolf lineages, with the African golden wolf having colonised Africa prior to the northern hemisphere radiation of the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/>\n\nTwo studies of the mitochondrial genome of both modern and extinct grey wolves (''Canis lupus'') have been conducted but these excluded the genetically divergent lineages of the Himalayan wolf and the Indian wolf. The ancient specimens were [[radiocarbon dated]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratagraphically]] dated, and together with DNA sequences a time-based [[phylogenetic tree]] was generated for wolves. The study inferred that the [[most recent common ancestor]] for all other ''Canis lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 years before present.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> An analysis of the Himalayan wolf mitochondrial genome indicates that the Himalayan wolf diverged between 740,000\u2014691,000 years ago from the lineage that would become the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the Himalayan wolf and Indian grey wolf were genetically closer to the [[African golden wolf]] than they were to the Holarctic grey wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> From 2017, two studies based on mDNA, and X-chromosome and Y-chromosome markers taken from the [[cell nucleus]], indicate that the Himalayan wolf is genetically basal to the Holarctic grey wolf. Its degree of divergence from the Holarctic grey wolf is similar to the degree of divergence of the African golden wolf from the Holarctic grey wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares a maternal lineage with the African golden wolf. It possesses a unique paternal lineage that falls between the grey wolf and the African golden wolf.<ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> The specimens used in these two studies show the high-elevation range of the Himalayan wolf to include the Himalayas then north across the Tibetan plateau to the [[Qinghai Lake]] in China's Qinghai Province.<ref name=werhahn2017/>\nIn 2018, whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The African golden wolf was found to be the descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72%&nbsp;grey wolf and 28%&nbsp;[[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/> The Ethiopian wolf does not share the single-nucleotide polymorphisms that confer hypoxia adaptation with the Himalayan wolf. The adaptation of the Ethiopian wolf to living in high elevations may occur at other single-nucleotide polymorphism locations. This indicates that the Ethiopian wolf's adaptation has not been inherited by descent from a common ancestor shared with the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Himalayan wolf.JPG|thumb|Himalayan wolf profile]]\nThe Himalayan wolf has a thick woolly fur that is dull earthy-brown on the back and tail, and yellowish-white on the face, belly and limbs. It is about {{convert|45|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} long and {{convert|30|inch|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall at the shoulder.<ref name=hodgson1847/><ref name=blanford1888/><ref name=lydekker1900/><ref name=pocock1941/> It is larger than the [[Indian wolf]].<ref name=jerdon1874/> It has closely-spaced black speckles on the muzzle, below the eyes, on the upper cheeks and ears.<ref name=chetri2016/> It weighs about {{convert|35|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"shrotriya2012\" />\n\nThe heart of the Himalayan wolf withstands the low oxygen level at high elevations. It has a strong selection for RYR2, a gene that initiates cardiac excitation.<ref name=Zhang2014/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Pin Valley, Spiti.jpg|thumb|[[Pin Valley National Park]] located in Himachal Pradesh]]\nIn China, the Himalayan wolf lives on the Tibetan Plateau in the provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Qinghai]], Tibet,<ref name=smith2008/><ref name=wang2003/> and western [[Sichuan]].<ref name=Werhahn2020/>\n\nIn northern India, it occurs in the [[Ladakh]] region of eastern [[Kashmir]]<ref name=lydekker1900/> and in the [[Lahaul and Spiti]] region in northeastern [[Himachal Pradesh]].<ref name=pocock1941/> In 2004, the Himalayan wolf population in India was estimated to consist of 350 individuals ranging across an area of about {{convert|70000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=sharma2004/>\nBetween 2005 and 2008, it was sighted in the alpine meadows above the tree line north-east of [[Nanda Devi National Park]] in [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=bhattacharya2010/> In 2013, a wolf was photographed by a camera trap installed at an elevation of about {{convert|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} near the Sunderdhunga Glacier in  Uttarakhand's [[Bageshwar district]].<ref name=pioneer2014/>\n\nIn Nepal, it was recorded in [[Api Nampa Conservation Area]], Upper [[Dolpo|Dolpa]], [[Holma]], [[Manaslu]], [[Upper Mustang]], and in [[Kanchenjunga Conservation Area]].<ref name=arnold2016/><ref name=werhahn2017b/> The Nepal Himalayas provide an important habitat refuge for the Himalayan wolf.<ref name=werhahn2018/>\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nThe howls of the Himalayan wolf have lower frequencies and are shorter in duration. These howls are acoustically distinct and differ significantly from each other and from other wolf subspecies.<ref name=\"hennelly2017\"/>\n\n===Prey===\nHimalayan wolves prefer wild over domestic prey. They prefer the smaller [[Tibetan gazelle]] than the larger [[white-lipped deer]], and they prefer the plains-dwelling Tibetan gazelle over the cliff-dwelling [[naur]]. Supplementary food includes the small [[Himalayan marmot]], [[woolly hare]], and [[pikas]]. Himalayan wolves avoided livestock where wild prey is available, however habitat encroachment and the depletion of wild prey populations is forecast to lead to conflict with herders. To protect these wolves it will be important to secure healthy wild prey populations through setting aside wildlife habitat reserves and refuges.<ref name=Werhahn2019/> \n\nHistorical sources indicate that wolves occasionally killed children in Ladakh and [[Lahaul and Spiti|Lahoul]].<ref name=pocock1941/> Within the proposed Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary in Ladakh, the intensity of livestock depredation was assessed in three villages. The assessment found that Tibetan wolves were the most important predators accounting for 60% of the total livestock losses, followed by the [[snow leopard]] and [[Eurasian lynx]]. The most frequent prey were [[domestic goat]]s (32%), followed by sheep (30%), [[yak]]s (15%), and [[horse]]s (13%). The wolves killed horses significantly more, and goats less, than would be expected from their relative abundance.<ref name=fox2007/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Canis lupus himalayensis.JPG|thumb|Wolves in the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park, Darjeeling]]\nThe wolf in Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan is listed on [[CITES]] [[CITES Appendix I|Appendix I]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Species+: ''Canis lupus'' |website=CITES Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC |year=2010 |url=https://speciesplus.net/#/taxon_concepts/4442/legal}}</ref>\nIn India, the wolf is protected under Schedule I of the ''[[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]'', which prohibits hunting; a zoo needs a permission from the government to acquire a wolf.

Enrico is so enraptured at the sight of Isabelle in her resplendent attire that he becomes her abject slave, casting aside the poor, peasant-clad little Italian street singer, who has loved him devotedly. Crushed almost beyond endurance the poor girl stands sobbing at the entrance of the park where the inconsistent lover left her. Her tears attract the attention of a wealthy young couple who happen to pass. In answer to their queries she tells them how contemptibly her sweetheart acted, and all because of the fascinating influence of a gown. The lady is moved to commiseration and offers her aid in the gift of the most beautiful gown Veronica has ever seen. Her opportunity for revenge has turned her love to hate, and as she appears at the Italian Benevolent Association ball, she is the star of the event, for she looks like a queen as she promenades the ball room. She at once becomes the \"Mrs. Trouble\" of the evening, for the men all desert their partners and flock around her, beseeching but a smile. All this elicits from the women folk delicate little bon-mots such as \"Hussy,\" \"Temptress,\" \"Cat,\" \"False hair,\" \"Paints,\"\u2014oh, well, you know how it is. Enrico is thrown into a rage that runs the entire gamut of his emotions,\u2014love, jealousy, hate, disappointment and a few others, too numerous to mention here. He begs forgiveness, declaring undying love, but she tells him it is the gown that has attracted him and not her, but on his knees he swears.

All this elicits from the women folk delicate little bon-mots such as \"Hussy,\" \"Temptress,\" \"Cat,\" \"False hair,\" \"Paints,\"\u2014oh, well, you know how it is. Enrico is thrown into a rage that runs the entire gamut of his emotions,\u2014love, jealousy, hate, disappointment and a few others, too numerous to mention here. He begs forgiveness, declaring undying love, but she tells him it is the gown that has attracted him and not her, but on his knees he swears. Still she will not trust him and turns to a poor good hearted Italian who has persistently loved her despite her coldness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Stories of the Films |url=https://archive.org/stream/moviwor04chal#page/n325/mode/2up |journal=[[Moving Picture World]] |location=New York |publisher=The World Photographic Publishing Co. |date=March 13, 1909 |access-date=February 21, 2016 }}</ref>}}\n\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marion Leonard]] as Isabelle\n* [[Harry Solter]] as Enrico\n* [[Florence Lawrence]] as Veronica\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0000946|The Lure of the Gown}}\n\n{{D.

Belzer also served as the first Scout Executive for the Indianapolis Council, later known as the Central Indiana Council.\n\nThe first [[List of Order of the Arrow national events|National Order of the Arrow Conference]] was held at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in 1948.\n\n==Recent history (1950-2010)==\nIn 1950, 1956, 1961, 1965, 1969, 1990, 2002, 2009 and 2018, the [[Order of the Arrow|National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC)]] was held at Indiana University in Bloomington, the most frequent venue for the event. In 1994, NOAC was held at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.\n\n==Boy Scouts of America in Indiana today==\n[[File:Indiana BSA Councils.png|thumbnail|BSA Councils serving Indiana.]]\nThere are nine [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) local councils in [[Indiana]]. All of Indiana lies within Central Region, except for Clark, Scott, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford, and Washington counties, as part of Southern Region.\n\n===Anthony Wayne Area Council===\nBased in Fort Wayne, Indiana and covering 11 counties in Northeast Indiana&nbsp;\u2014 Adams, Wells, Jay, Huntington, Allen, DeKalb, LaGrange, Noble, Steuben, Whitley, Kosciusko. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.awac.org | title = Anthony Wayne Area Council}}</ref>\n\n*Lincolnway District (Whitley and Kosciusko Counties)\n*Miami District (Southern Allen County)\n*Pokagon District (DeKalb, LaGrange, Noble, Steuben)\n*Three Rivers District (Learning for Life)\n*Thunderbird District (Northern Allen County)\n*Wabash Valley District (Adams, Huntington, Jay, Wells)\n\nFeatures Anthony Wayne Scout Reservation with Camp Chief Little Turtle\n\n====Anthony Wayne Scout Reservation====\nThe '''Anthony Wayne Scout Reservation''' is a [[Scouts BSA]] camp located near [[Ashley, Indiana]], [[United States]].\n\nThe reservation has three key areas: Camp Chief Little Turtle (CCLT), Camp Foellinger, and Camp Wilderness.\n*Camp Chief Little Turtle is the main camp. It has many activity centers, such as a waterfront, handicraft, outdoor skills, Project C.O.P.E., and other typical features of a Scouts BSA camp.\n*Camp Foellinger is used mainly for special events, such as [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scout]] camp, National Youth Leadership Training, and Order of the Arrow events.\n*Camp Wilderness contains the Jack Zeiger Ropes Course&nbsp;\u2014 used for C.O.P.E. and rock climbing&nbsp;\u2014 and Orion, an area used for camping and wilderness survival training.\n\n===Buffalo Trace Council===\nThe '''Buffalo Trace Council''' is based in Evansville, Indiana that serves southwestern [[Indiana]] and southeastern Illinois.  Its affiliated [[Order of the Arrow]] lodge is Kiondaga Lodge. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.buffalotracecouncil.org | title = Buffalo Trace Council}}</ref>\n\n====Camps====\nThe Buffalo Trace Council has operated four camps throughout its existence, three of which are still in existence.  [[Camp Arthur]], located near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], opened in 1945 and was removed from the list of BSA-approved camping facilities for a time in the mid-1990s.  [[Camp Carnes]], located between [[Jasper, Indiana|Jasper]] and [[Dubois, Indiana|Dubois]], has since changed ownership to the City of [[Jasper, Indiana|Jasper]] and is run as a park.  [[Old Ben Scout Reservation]] (OBSR), located in [[Pike County, Indiana]] opened in 1985 on the site of an abandoned [[strip mine]] operated by the [[Old Ben Coal Company]] and was the council's current primary summer camp location, until a lack of funding forced the council to cease having summer camps there.  [[Camp Pohoka]] was the previous summer camp location, but was shut down when OBSR was opened.\n\n==== Districts ====\n\n=====Algonkian (formerly Three Rivers)=====\n*[[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards County]]\n*[[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson County]]\n*[[Knox County, Indiana|Knox County]]\n*[[Lawrence County, Illinois|Lawrence County]]\n*[[Richland County, Illinois|Richland County]]\n*[[Wabash County, Illinois|Wabash County]]\n\n=====Lincoln Heritage=====\n*[[Dubois County, Indiana|Dubois County]]\n*[[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]]\n*[[Pike County, Indiana|Pike County]]\n*[[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]\n*[[Warrick County, Indiana|Warrick County]] (excluding the Newburgh area)\n\n=====Native Trails=====\n*[[Gallatin County, Illinois|Gallatin County]]\n*[[Newburgh, Indiana|Newburgh]]\n*[[Posey County, Indiana|Posey County]]\n*[[Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Vanderburgh County]]\n*[[White County, Illinois|White County]]\n\n===Calumet Council===\n'''Calumet Council''' is headquartered in [[Munster, Indiana]] and serves Scouts in Indiana and Illinois.\n\nServing the youth of the 54 communities comprising the south suburbs of Chicago and Northwest Indiana since 1917, the Calumet Council is the local entity of the Boy Scouts of America and Learning for Life Programs.\n\nCalumet Council was formed in 1966, and was the result of a merger of the Pokagon Trails Council in [[Hammond, Indiana]] and the Sauk Trails Council in [[Gary, Indiana]]. In 1971 the Twin City Council in East Chicago, Indiana joined to make up the current structure. Camp Frank S. Betz, located in Berrien Springs, MI (USA) is operated by the Calumet Council. 'Betz' has served Scouts in the South Suburbs of Chicago and Northwest Indiana since 1922.\n\nIn 2008, over 13,000 young men and women were active members of the Scouting program in the Calumet Council. Over 4,100 adult volunteers, supported by a small staff, provide a top quality \"values based\" program, with an emphasis on outdoor programs and life skills.\n\nDue to the unique demographics of the Calumet Council, a special program designed to serve the hardest to reach \"at risk\" youth, called [[Scoutreach]], is used in lower income communities. In 2008, sixty six Scoutreach Cub Scout packs, Boy Scout troops and Venture Crews were active in nine different communities with over 1,400 members.\n\nThe Eagle Scout Award, the highest award a boy can earn in Scouting, was presented to 74 young men in 2006. These newest Eagles totaled over 3,200 combined service hours in the 74 different community service projects which they carried out as part of the Eagle Scout requirement.\n\nThe Council operates four districts: Crossroads, Nishnabec, Prairie Dunes, and Thunderbird. These service areas were formed in 2005 as a result of a restructuring to utilize volunteer resources better.\n\nThe Order of the Arrow is Scouting's National Honor Society. The council's chapter is Michigamea Order of the Arrow Lodge number 110. It is youth-run and advised by adult volunteers. Michigamea lodge has over 600 active members. In 2008, the Lodge received The National Service Award for their work on the new Frank S. Betz firebowl. This annual award is only presented to eight lodges nationally.\n\nThe Council Executive Board is made up of 44 local business and community leaders who guide to the year-round operation of the Council. The Council Key III is made up of President T. Edward Page, Council Commissioner Todd Dykton and Acting Scout Executive Matthew Thornton.\n\nThis council was merged into the Pathway to Adventure Council and the Order of the Arrow Lodge was merged with the 3 other Pathway to Adventure Council Order of the Arrow Lodges into Takhone Lodge 7 in January 2019. Visit oa7.org for New Lodge Details\n\n===Crossroads of America Council===\nHeadquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Crossroads of America Council (BSA Council #160) serves Scouts and Scouters in Central Indiana.  It was initially formed when Central Indiana Council, Delaware County Council, Kikthawenund Council, and Whitewater Valley Council merged in 1972.  Recently, in the past decade, Wabash Valley and Crossroads of America were merged to form the new Crossroads of America Council, serving 25 counties in Indiana, extending from the Illinois state line to the Ohio state line.  As of the end of 2012, the council served more than 36,000 youth thanks to more than 9,000 volunteer leaders.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org |title = Crossroads of America Council}}</ref>\n\nThe Crossroads of America Council is served by Jaccos Towne Lodge #21, [[Order of the Arrow]].  It is also home to [[Firecrafter]], a local Scouting service fraternity.  Central Indiana Council was not home to a lodge of the Order of the Arrow until the merger of the councils in 1972.  Joe Wiltrout is the current Scout Executive.  The council maintains Scout offices in Indianapolis, Muncie, and Terre Haute.\n\nThe Crossroads of America Council has also served as home of the Crossroads of America Scout Band.

In 1917 local Troop 3 decided to use the property as a summer camp, as it would for three summers. The '''George Rogers Clark Council''' shortly after 1927 bought Tunnel Mill from the Murphy family, who had bought the property the previous year but lost interest after a mill fire. In 1933 the three-sided wooden Pioneer Village cabins were built. In 1942 the [[Scoutmaster]]'s Cabin and Evergreen cabins were completed. In 1950 the McDonald Bridge was completed across [[Fourteen Mile Creek]]. The camp saw its greatest use in the 1950s and 1960s, with 564 Scouts, the highest attendance ever, in 1960. In 1969 the swimming pool was built, to replace the creek, now-unsafe for swimming. By the 1980s the lessening attendance made the future of the camp uncertain. When the George Rogers Clark Council, which owned the property, merged with '''Old Kentucky Home Council''', one of the conditions was that Tunnel Mill would not be closed. Since 1993 the camp has been used primarily by [[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] and for winter camping.<ref name=\"Purlee\">{{cite book| title = Tunnel Mill: the story of an historical grist mill and an historic Boy Scout camp | first = Gary D. | last = Purlee  | year = 2005}}</ref> The property includes a cabin village, a swimming pool, and a dining hall built in 2000.

[[Camp Pohoka]] was the previous summer camp location, but was shut down when OBSR was opened.\n\n==== Districts ====\n\n=====Algonkian (formerly Three Rivers)=====\n*[[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards County]]\n*[[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson County]]\n*[[Knox County, Indiana|Knox County]]\n*[[Lawrence County, Illinois|Lawrence County]]\n*[[Richland County, Illinois|Richland County]]\n*[[Wabash County, Illinois|Wabash County]]\n\n=====Lincoln Heritage=====\n*[[Dubois County, Indiana|Dubois County]]\n*[[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]]\n*[[Pike County, Indiana|Pike County]]\n*[[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]\n*[[Warrick County, Indiana|Warrick County]] (excluding the Newburgh area)\n\n=====Native Trails=====\n*[[Gallatin County, Illinois|Gallatin County]]\n*[[Newburgh, Indiana|Newburgh]]\n*[[Posey County, Indiana|Posey County]]\n*[[Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Vanderburgh County]]\n*[[White County, Illinois|White County]]\n\n===Calumet Council===\n'''Calumet Council''' is headquartered in [[Munster, Indiana]] and serves Scouts in Indiana and Illinois.\n\nServing the youth of the 54 communities comprising the south suburbs of Chicago and Northwest Indiana since 1917, the Calumet Council is the local entity of the Boy Scouts of America and Learning for Life Programs.\n\nCalumet Council was formed in 1966, and was the result of a merger of the Pokagon Trails Council in [[Hammond, Indiana]] and the Sauk Trails Council in [[Gary, Indiana]]. In 1971 the Twin City Council in East Chicago, Indiana joined to make up the current structure. Camp Frank S. Betz, located in Berrien Springs, MI (USA) is operated by the Calumet Council. 'Betz' has served Scouts in the South Suburbs of Chicago and Northwest Indiana since 1922.\n\nIn 2008, over 13,000 young men and women were active members of the Scouting program in the Calumet Council. Over 4,100 adult volunteers, supported by a small staff, provide a top quality \"values based\" program, with an emphasis on outdoor programs and life skills.\n\nDue to the unique demographics of the Calumet Council, a special program designed to serve the hardest to reach \"at risk\" youth, called [[Scoutreach]], is used in lower income communities. In 2008, sixty six Scoutreach Cub Scout packs, Boy Scout troops and Venture Crews were active in nine different communities with over 1,400 members.\n\nThe Eagle Scout Award, the highest award a boy can earn in Scouting, was presented to 74 young men in 2006. These newest Eagles totaled over 3,200 combined service hours in the 74 different community service projects which they carried out as part of the Eagle Scout requirement.\n\nThe Council operates four districts: Crossroads, Nishnabec, Prairie Dunes, and Thunderbird. These service areas were formed in 2005 as a result of a restructuring to utilize volunteer resources better.\n\nThe Order of the Arrow is Scouting's National Honor Society. The council's chapter is Michigamea Order of the Arrow Lodge number 110. It is youth-run and advised by adult volunteers. Michigamea lodge has over 600 active members. In 2008, the Lodge received The National Service Award for their work on the new Frank S. Betz firebowl. This annual award is only presented to eight lodges nationally.\n\nThe Council Executive Board is made up of 44 local business and community leaders who guide to the year-round operation of the Council. The Council Key III is made up of President T. Edward Page, Council Commissioner Todd Dykton and Acting Scout Executive Matthew Thornton.\n\nThis council was merged into the Pathway to Adventure Council and the Order of the Arrow Lodge was merged with the 3 other Pathway to Adventure Council Order of the Arrow Lodges into Takhone Lodge 7 in January 2019. Visit oa7.org for New Lodge Details\n\n===Crossroads of America Council===\nHeadquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Crossroads of America Council (BSA Council #160) serves Scouts and Scouters in Central Indiana.  It was initially formed when Central Indiana Council, Delaware County Council, Kikthawenund Council, and Whitewater Valley Council merged in 1972.  Recently, in the past decade, Wabash Valley and Crossroads of America were merged to form the new Crossroads of America Council, serving 25 counties in Indiana, extending from the Illinois state line to the Ohio state line.  As of the end of 2012, the council served more than 36,000 youth thanks to more than 9,000 volunteer leaders.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org |title = Crossroads of America Council}}</ref>\n\nThe Crossroads of America Council is served by Jaccos Towne Lodge #21, [[Order of the Arrow]].  It is also home to [[Firecrafter]], a local Scouting service fraternity.  Central Indiana Council was not home to a lodge of the Order of the Arrow until the merger of the councils in 1972.  Joe Wiltrout is the current Scout Executive.  The council maintains Scout offices in Indianapolis, Muncie, and Terre Haute.\n\nThe Crossroads of America Council has also served as home of the Crossroads of America Scout Band.  Founded in 1917 by \"Chief\" F.O. Belzer as a camp band, this band has grown into a concert band that has traveled throughout the United States, Canada and England representing the Boy Scouts of America and the Crossroads of America Council for 102 years.  The Bands annual summer tour takes it to as many scout camps as it can for the enjoyment of those scouts at camp.  <ref>{{cite web | url = http://scoutband.com/ |title = Scout Band|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010422002636/http://scoutband.com/|archive-date = 2001-04-22}}</ref>}\n\n====Districts====\n* Bear Creek District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/140|title =Bear Creek District}}</ref>, serving Fayette, Franklin, Rush, Shelby, Union, Wayne and southern Randolph counties\n* Del-Mi District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/137 |title =Del-Mi District}}</ref>, serving Hamilton and Tipton counties\n* Golden Eagle District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://crossroadsbsa.org/138 |title = Golden Eagle District}}</ref>, serving Blackford, Delaware, eastern Henry, and northern Randolph Counties\n* Hou Koda District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/139 |title =Hou Koda District}}</ref>, serving southwestern Marion county and Hendricks county\n* Northeast District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/142 |title =Northeast District}}</ref>, serving northeast Marion county and northwestern Hancock county\n*Northeast District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/258 |title =Northeast District}}</ref>, serving northwestern Marion county, and southeastern Boone county\n* Pathfinder District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/144 |title = Pathfinder District}}</ref>, serving southern Marion county and Johnson county\n* Pioneer District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/145 |title = Pioneer District}}</ref>, serving east central Marion County and southeastern Hancock county\n* Sakima District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/146 |title = Sakima District}}</ref>, serving Madison county, and western Henry county\n* Sugar Creek District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://crossroadsbsa.org/147 |title = Sugar Creek District}}</ref>, serving Boone, northern Hendricks, Montgomery, and Clinton counties\n* Wabash Valley District<ref>{{cite web | url = http://crossroadsbsa.org/149 |title = Wabash Valley District}}</ref>, serving Clay, Vigo, Sullivan, southern Vermillion, Parke, and Putnam Counties\n\n====Camps====\nThe [[Crossroads of America Council]] currently operates <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.crossroadsbsa.org/rentals | title =Rentals}}</ref> seven camps]:\n* Ransburg Scout Reservation<ref>{{cite web | url =  http://www.ransburgbsa.org |title =Ransburg Scout Reservation}}</ref> - [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]\n* Camp Belzer<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.campbelzer.org |title =Camp Belzer}}</ref>- Indianapolis\n* Camp Kikthawenund - [[Frankton, Indiana|Frankton]]\n* Camp Bear Creek - [[Connersville, Indiana|Connersville]]\n* Camp Red Wing - [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]]\n* Camp Krietenstein - [[Center Point, Indiana|Center Point]]\n* Camp Wildwood - [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]]\n\n===Hoosier Trails Council===\n{{Infobox WorldScouting\n|name=Hoosier Trails Council\n|image=\n|type=council\n|owner=[[Boy Scouts of America]]\n|location=[[Bloomington, Indiana]]\n|country=United States\n|coords=\n|f-date=\n|defunct=\n|founders=\n|founder=\n|members=\n|chiefscouttitle=President\n|chiefscout= \n|chiefscouttitle2=Council Commissioner\n|chiefscout2=  \n|chiefscouttitle3=Scout Executive\n|chiefscout3=  Glen Steenberger\n|website={{url|http://www.hoosiertrailsbsa.org}}\n}}\nThe Hoosier Trails Council, BSA serves in 18 counties in south-central Indiana, and to more than 6,000 youth each year.<ref name=\"About Us\">{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://www.hoosiertrailsbsa.org/726 |website=Hoosier Trails Council|accessdate=2020-02-25}}</ref> \n====History====\nThe Hoosier Trails Council is the result of several council mergers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hook|first1=James |last2=Franck |first2=Dave|last3=Austin|first3=Steve |year=1982 |title=An Aid to Collecting Selected Council Shoulder Patches with Valuation |url=http://www.angelfire.com/tx6/patch/cspbook.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, the Bartholomew County Council (#150) was founded.

In 1917 local Troop 3 decided to use the property as a summer camp, as it would for three summers. The '''George Rogers Clark Council''' shortly after 1927 bought Tunnel Mill from the Murphy family, who had bought the property the previous year but lost interest after a mill fire. In 1933 the three-sided wooden Pioneer Village cabins were built. In 1942 the [[Scoutmaster]]'s Cabin and Evergreen cabins were completed. In 1950 the McDonald Bridge was completed across [[Fourteen Mile Creek]]. The camp saw its greatest use in the 1950s and 1960s, with 564 Scouts, the highest attendance ever, in 1960. In 1969 the swimming pool was built, to replace the creek, now-unsafe for swimming. By the 1980s the lessening attendance made the future of the camp uncertain. When the George Rogers Clark Council, which owned the property, merged with '''Old Kentucky Home Council''', one of the conditions was that Tunnel Mill would not be closed. Since 1993 the camp has been used primarily by [[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] and for winter camping.<ref name=\"Purlee\">{{cite book| title = Tunnel Mill: the story of an historical grist mill and an historic Boy Scout camp | first = Gary D. | last = Purlee  | year = 2005}}</ref> The property includes a cabin village, a swimming pool, and a dining hall built in 2000.

({{lang-pt|Rep\u00fablica de Angola}}), is a country on the west coast of [[Southern Africa]]. It is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]], bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is [[Luanda]].\n\nThe territory of Angola has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Era]], hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups, tribes and kingdoms. The nation state of Angola originated from [[Portuguese colonization of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which initially began with coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].\n\nAfter a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], independence was achieved in 1975 as the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola]], a [[one-party state]] supported by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. The [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between the ruling [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) and the insurgent anti-communist [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), supported by the United States and [[apartheid South Africa]], lasted until 2002. The [[sovereign state]] has since become a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic|constitutional republic]].\n\nAngola has vast [[Mineral reserve|mineral]] and [[petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, the [[standard of living]] remains low for most of the population, and [[life expectancy]] in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while [[infant mortality]] is among the highest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120024054/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's [[wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small sector of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=1 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006051053/http://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|archive-date=6 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAngola is a member state of the [[United Nations]], [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]].

The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/>\n[[File:Cadornega.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''History of Angola''; written in Luanda in 1680.]]\nThe [[slave trade]] was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/> Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by Lisbon abolished [[slavery]] altogether.

({{lang-pt|Rep\u00fablica de Angola}}), is a country on the west coast of [[Southern Africa]]. It is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]], bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is [[Luanda]].\n\nThe territory of Angola has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Era]], hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups, tribes and kingdoms. The nation state of Angola originated from [[Portuguese colonization of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which initially began with coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].\n\nAfter a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], independence was achieved in 1975 as the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola]], a [[one-party state]] supported by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. The [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between the ruling [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) and the insurgent anti-communist [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), supported by the United States and [[apartheid South Africa]], lasted until 2002. The [[sovereign state]] has since become a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic|constitutional republic]].\n\nAngola has vast [[Mineral reserve|mineral]] and [[petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, the [[standard of living]] remains low for most of the population, and [[life expectancy]] in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while [[infant mortality]] is among the highest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120024054/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's [[wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small sector of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=1 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006051053/http://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|archive-date=6 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAngola is a member state of the [[United Nations]], [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]].

The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/>\n[[File:Cadornega.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''History of Angola''; written in Luanda in 1680.]]\nThe [[slave trade]] was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/> Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by Lisbon abolished [[slavery]] altogether.
