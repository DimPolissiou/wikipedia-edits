His suit was dismissed by the [[federal district court]], but on appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the ruling, concluding that Frederick's speech rights were violated.\n\n[[Chief Justice Roberts]], writing for the majority, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment. To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

Frederick then appealed to the Juneau School Board, which upheld the suspension on March 19, 2002.\n\n===District court===\n{{Youth rights sidebar|Activities}}\nOn April&nbsp;25, 2002, Frederick filed a [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|civil rights]] lawsuit (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) against Morse and the school board, claiming they violated his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech.<ref name=Mears/> He sought a [[declaratory relief]] (for a declaratory judgment that his First Amendment rights had been violated), [[Injunction|injunctive]] relief (for an injunction to remove the reference to the ten-day suspension from his school records), and monetary awards ([[Compensatory damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory damages]], [[punitive damages]], and [[attorney's fee]]s).<ref name=MvF4>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 399.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]] dismissed Frederick's case on [[summary judgment]].<ref>''Frederick v.

Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No.'\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}. The Court, in holding (contra the District Court) that ''[[Tinker v.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He defined the disruptiveness in general terms as behavior inimical to the educational mission of the school, and in specific terms as a violation of the school's announced policy to enforce and support laws with respect to the control of marijuana (and other laws in general). Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> That case was said to be concerned with school disciplinary actions \"casting a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, ''Morse v.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>\n\nDeputy Solicitor-General [[Edwin Kneedler]] spoke on behalf of the U.S. government in support of the petitioner. He said: \"The First Amendment does not require public school officials to stand aside and permit students who are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote or encourage the illegal use of drugs.\"<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 19, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He cited the cases of ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' and ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'' in his favor.\n\nDouglas K. Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''. A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the class room: we are light years away from that.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 59, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits&nbsp;...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No.&nbsp;92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.

It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure. Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would&nbsp;... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]].

For example, in Wisniewski, a student was suspended after school officials learned of an instant messenger icon he had created that depicted the shooting of his English teacher. 494 F.3d at 35. In one of the few decisions citing to Morse, the Second Circuit declined to consider whether the true threat doctrine was relevant, and instead applied ''Tinker''{{'}}s substantial disruption test. Id. at 38\u201339. The court held that the school did not violate the student's First Amendment rights by suspending him because it was reasonably foreseeable that the icon would come to school officials' attention and cause a disruption at school. Id. at 39\u201340.\n\nFor a discussion of the true threat doctrine's application to student speech, see Andrew P. Stanner, Note, Toward an Improved True Threat Doctrine for Student Speakers, 81 ''NYU Law Review'', 385 (2006).

Frederick'': How Will ''Morse v. Frederick'' Be Applied?\" 12 ''Lewis & Clark Law Review'', 1</ref> noting that Chief Justice Roberts \"sought to keep the decision quite narrow\", limiting the case \"to the issue of public school administrators' ability to keep the educational process free from messages about illegal drugs\" and drawing from the Court's existing student speech jurisprudence that \"permitted school administrators broad discretion to keep out of the educational environment antisocial messages celebrating drug use\".<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n===Erwin Chemerinsky===\nLeading constitutional law scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] participated in the same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; second, that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech\u2014based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools and a school's \"important, indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\nOne scholar noted that \"by its plain language, ''Morse''{{'}}s holding is narrow in that it expressly applies only to student speech promoting illegal drug use.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/> She adds, however, that courts could nonetheless apply it to other student speech that, like speech encouraging illegal drug use, similarly undermines schools' educational missions or threatens students' safety. \"Further, ''Morse'' arguably permits viewpoint discrimination of purely political speech whenever that speech mentions illegal drugs\u2014a result seemingly at odds with the First Amendment.\"<ref name=\"Dickler\"/>\n\n==Background and procedural history{{anchor|Background}}==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bong Hits 4 Jesus banner.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The banner in question]] -->\n[[File:Bong Hits for Jesus.jpg|thumb|left|The original banner now hanging in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, DC.]]]]On January 24, 2002, students and staff at [[Juneau-Douglas High School]] in Alaska were permitted to leave classes{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit, which held in favor of Frederick, noted: {{quote|Frederick says that students were simply released from school so that they could watch the privately sponsored Olympic Torch being carried through a public street, and a student affidavit he submitted pointed out that the students did not have to obtain parental permission slips to be released, as is the routine for field trips and other supervised events off the school premises.

Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No.'\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He defined the disruptiveness in general terms as behavior inimical to the educational mission of the school, and in specific terms as a violation of the school's announced policy to enforce and support laws with respect to the control of marijuana (and other laws in general). Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> That case was said to be concerned with school disciplinary actions \"casting a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, ''Morse v.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He cited the cases of ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' and ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'' in his favor.\n\nDouglas K. Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''. A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the class room: we are light years away from that.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 59, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits&nbsp;...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No.&nbsp;92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.

It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure. Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened.

He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence.

These tragic events led to a significant number of cases and articles on the subject of school violence. For example, in Wisniewski, a student was suspended after school officials learned of an instant messenger icon he had created that depicted the shooting of his English teacher. 494 F.3d at 35. In one of the few decisions citing to Morse, the Second Circuit declined to consider whether the true threat doctrine was relevant, and instead applied ''Tinker'''s substantial disruption test. Id. at 38\u201339. The court held that the school did not violate the student's First Amendment rights by suspending him because it was reasonably foreseeable that the icon would come to school officials' attention and cause a disruption at school. Id. at 39\u201340.\n\nFor a discussion of the true threat doctrine's application to student speech, see Andrew P.

Frederick'': How Will ''Morse v. Frederick'' Be Applied?\" 12 ''Lewis & Clark Law Review'', 1</ref> noting that Chief Justice Roberts \"sought to keep the decision quite narrow\", limiting the case \"to the issue of public school administrators' ability to keep the educational process free from messages about illegal drugs\" and drawing from the Court's existing student speech jurisprudence that \"permitted school administrators broad discretion to keep out of the educational environment antisocial messages celebrating drug use\".<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n===Erwin Chemerinsky===\nLeading constitutional law scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] participated in the same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

The suggestion that Barara was located on Mount Entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking Addis Ababa located between rock-hewn Washa Mikael and the more modern church of Entoto Maryam, founded in the late 19th century by Emperor [[Menelik II|Menelik]].

His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Mount Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area.<ref name=Addis2 /><ref name=Addis1 />\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Mausoleum des Kaisers Menelik I. auf dem H\u00fcgel des grossen Gibi-Abessinienflug 1934-LBS MH02-22-0326.tif|thumb|left|The Te'eka Negist Mausoleum at [[Menelik Palace]] in Addis Ababa, 1934.]]\nHowever, the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town for lack of [[firewood]] and water, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in 1886. Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the \"Filwoha\" hot [[mineral springs]], where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the [[Imperial Palace Addis Ababa|Imperial Palace]] which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today. The name changed to Addis Ababa and became Ethiopia's capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that are still visible today is the planting of numerous [[eucalyptus]] trees along the city streets.<ref>Pankhurst, p. 195</ref>\n[[File:Selassie_and_Nasser,_1963.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia and President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt in Addis Ababa for the [[Organisation of African Unity]] summit, 1963.]]\nFollowing all the major engagements of [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|their invasion]], [[Fascist Italy (1922\u201343)|Italian]] troops from the colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Along with [[Dire Dawa]], the city had been spared the aerial bombardment (including the use of [[chemical weapons]] such as [[mustard gas]]) practiced elsewhere and [[Franco-Ethiopian Railway|its railway]] to [[Djibouti]] remained intact. After the occupation the city served as the [[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]]'s capital for unified [[Italian East Africa]] until 1941, when it was abandoned in favor of [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1941)|Amba Alagi]] and other redoubts during the [[Second World War]]'s [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. The city was liberated by Major [[Orde Wingate]] and negus [[Haile Selassie]] for Ethiopian [[Gideon Force]] and Ethiopian resistance in time to permit Emperor Haile Selassie's return on 5 May 1941, five years to the day after he had left. Following reconstruction, Haile Selassie helped form the [[Organisation of African Unity]] in 1963 and invited the new organization to keep its headquarters in Addis Ababa.

The high elevation moderates temperatures year-round, and the city's position near the [[equator]] means that temperatures are very constant from month to month. As such the climate would be [[oceanic climate|maritime]] if its elevation was not taken into account, as no month is above {{convert|22|C|F}} in mean temperatures.\n\nMid-November to January is a season for occasional rain. The highland climate regions are characterized by dry winters, and this is the dry season in Addis Ababa. During this season the daily maximum temperatures are usually not more than {{convert|23|\u00b0C}}, and the night-time minimum temperatures can drop to freezing. The short rainy season is from February to May. During this period, the difference between the daytime maximum temperatures and the night-time minimum temperatures is not as great as during other times of the year, with minimum temperatures in the range of {{convert|10|-|15|\u00b0C}}. At this time of the year, the city experiences warm temperatures and a pleasant rainfall. The long wet season is from June to mid-September; it is the major winter season of the country. This period coincides with summer, but the temperatures are much lower than at other times of year because of the frequent rain and hail and the abundance of cloud cover and fewer hours of sunshine.

The other city with the same status is Dire Dawa in the east of the country and both are federal cities.  Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the Transitional Charter of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.\n\nThe administration of Addis Ababa city consists of the Mayor, who leads the executive branch, and the City Council, which enacts city regulations. However, as part of the Federal Government, the federal legislature enacts laws that are binding in Addis Ababa. Members of the City Council are directly elected by the residents of the city and the Council, in turn, elects the Mayor among its members. The term of office for elected officials is five years. However, the Federal Government, when it deems necessary, can dissolve the City Council and the entire administration and replace it by a temporary administration until elections take place next. Residents of Addis Ababa are represented in the federal legislature, the House of Peoples' Representatives. However, the city is not represented in the House of Federation, which is the federal upper house constituted by the representatives of the member states. The executive branch under the Mayor comprises the City Manager and various branches of civil service offices.\n\nThe current Mayor of Addis Ababa is Engineer [[Takele Uma Benti]] from the [[Oromo Democratic Party]], ODP formerly [[Oromo People Democratic Organisation]] (OPDO), which is the member of the ruling coalition Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Engineer Takele Uma took office in 2018. His predecessor, Mr. Dirribaa Kumaa and Kumaa Dammaqsaa (also both from the ODP), were the city's mayor respectively before Takele. Before that, the Federal Government appointed Mr. Berhane Deressa to lead the temporary caretaker administration that served from 9 May 2006 to 30 October 2008 following the 2005 election crisis. In the 2005 national election, the ruling EPRDF party suffered a major defeat in Addis Ababa. However, the opposition who won in Addis Ababa did not take part in the government both on the regional and federal level. This situation forced the EPRDF-led Federal Government to assign a temporary administration until a new election was carried out. As a result, Mr. Berhane Deressa, an independent citizen, was appointed.\n\nSome of the notable past mayors of Addis Ababa are [[Arkebe Oqubay]] (2003\u201306), Zewde Teklu (1985\u201389), Alemu Abebe (1977\u201385) and Zewde Gebrehiwot (1960\u201369).\n\n===Crime===\nAddis Ababa is considered to be extremely safe in comparison to the other cities in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/5-reasons-to-visit-addis-ababa-now-11088|title=5 Reasons to Visit Addis Ababa Now|website=www.fodors.com|access-date=2016-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114235156/http://www.fodors.com/news/5-reasons-to-visit-addis-ababa-now-11088|archive-date=14 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On a crime index, Addis Ababa scores a 44.28, putting it at a crime level of moderate.

A few meters to the southwest of the Anwar Mosque is the Raguel Church built after the liberation by Empress Menen. The proximity of the mosque and the church has symbolized the long peaceful relations between Christianity and Islam in Ethiopia. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family is also in the Merkato district. Near [[Bole International Airport]] is the new Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Cathedral, which is the second largest in Africa.\n\nThe [[Entoto Mountains]] start among the northern suburbs. Suburbs of the city include Shiro Meda and [[Entoto]] in the north, Urael and [[Bole Medhanealem|Bole]] (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, [[Nifas Silk]] in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and [[Keranio (Addis Ababa)|Keraniyo]] and [[Kolfe]] in the west. Kolfe was mentioned in [[Nelson Mandela]]'s Autobiography \"A Long Walk to Freedom\", as the place he got military training.\n\nAddis Ababa has a distinct architectural style. Unlike many African cities, Addis Ababa was not built as a colonial settlement. This means that the city has not a European style of architecture. This changed with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. The Piazza district in the city center is the most evident indicator of Italian influence. The buildings are very much Italian in style and there are many Italian restaurants, as well as small cafes, and European-style shopping centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-guides.com/africa/east-africa/ethiopia/ethiopia_addis_ababa.html|title=Ethiopia Capital City, About Addis Ababa Tourism and Travel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115131857/http://www.world-guides.com/africa/east-africa/ethiopia/ethiopia_addis_ababa.html|archive-date=15 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nParks include the [[Africa Park]], which is situated along Menelik II Avenue.\n\nOther features of the city include the large [[Addis Mercato|Mercato]] market, the Jan Meda [[racecourse]], Bihere Tsige Recreation Centre and a railway line to [[Djibouti]].\n\n==Culture==\nThe fossilized skeleton, and a plaster replica of the early hominid [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] (known in Ethiopia as ''Dinkinesh'') is preserved at the [[National Museum of Ethiopia]] in Addis Ababa. [[Meskel Square]] is one of the noted squares in the city and is the site for the annual [[Meskel]] at the end of September annually when thousands gather in celebration.\n\nThe city is home to the [[Ethiopian National Library]], the Ethiopian Ethnological Museum (and [[Guenete Leul Palace|former Guenete Leul Palace]]), the [[Addis Ababa Museum]], the [[Ethiopian Natural History Museum]], the Ethiopian Railway Museum and National Postal Museum.\n\nThere is also [[Menelek II of Ethiopia|Menelik]]'s old [[Imperial Palace Addis Ababa|Imperial palace]] which remains the official seat of government, and the [[National Palace (Ethiopia)|National Palace]] formerly known as the Jubilee Palace (built to mark Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955) which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia. Jubilee Palace was also modeled after Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom. [[Africa Hall]] is located across Menelik II avenue from this Palace and is where the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is headquartered as well as most UN offices in Ethiopia. It is also the site of the founding of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), which eventually became the [[African Union]] (AU). The African Union is now housed in a new headquarters built on the site of the demolished [[Akaki Prison]], on land donated by Ethiopia for this purpose in the south western part of the city. The [[Hager Fikir Theatre]], the oldest theater in Ethiopia, is located at the Piazza district. Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the art deco Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the Shengo Hall, built by the [[Derg]] regime of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its new parliament hall. The Shengo Hall was the world's largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in [[Finland]] before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions.  [[Taitu Hotel|Itegue Taitu Hotel]], built in 1898 ([[Ethiopian Calendar]]) in the middle of the city (Piazza), was the first hotel in Ethiopia.\n\n==Sport==\nSport facilities include [[Addis Abeba Stadium|Addis Ababa]] and [[Nyala Stadium]]s. The [[2008 African Championships in Athletics]] were held in Addis Ababa.\n\n===Development===\nThe city hosts the We Are the Future center, a child care center that provides children with a higher standard of living. The center is managed under the direction of the mayor's office, and the international NGO [[Glocal Forum]] serves as the fundraiser and program planner and coordinator for the WAF child center in each city. Each WAF city is linked to several peer cities and public and private partners to create a unique international coalition.\n\nLaunched in 2004, the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the [[Quincy Jones]] Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the [[World Bank]], UN agencies and major companies.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Arat Kilo Monument.JPG|Arat Kilo monument\nFile:Ethiopian Commercial Bank Addis Abeba.jpg|Commercial [[Bank of Ethiopia]]\nFile:ET Addis asv2018-01 img01 Meskel Square.jpg|[[Meskel Square]]\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale Saint Georges Addis Abeba1.jpg|[[St George's Cathedral (Addis Ababa)|St George's Cathedral]]\nFile:HagerFikirTheatre.jpg|[[Hager Fikir Theatre]] (April 2006)\nFile:Ethiopian Television.JPG|Ethiopian Radio and Television station\nFile:Ethiopian Federal Police HQ Addis Abeba.JPG|Headquarters of the Ethiopian Federal Police\nFile:Light Rail Traffic Circle.jpg|Light rail overpass at Mexico Square, Addis Ababa\n</gallery>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:ET Addis asv2018-01 img13 University gate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Addis Ababa University]]]]\n[[Addis Ababa University]] was founded in 1950 and was originally named \"University College of Addis Ababa\", then renamed in 1962 for the former Ethiopian emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]] who had donated his Genete Leul Palace to be the university's main campus in the previous year. It is the home of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum. The city also has numerous public universities and private colleges including [[Addis Ababa Science and Technology University]], [[Ethiopian Civil Service University]], [[Admas University College\u2013Addis Ababa|Admas University College]], [[St. Mary's University (Addis Ababa)|St. Mary's University]], [[Unity University]], Kotebe Metropolitan University and Rift Valley University.\n\n==Transport==\n\n[[File:Bole international airport.jpg|thumb|Bole international airport]]\nPublic transport is through public buses from three different companies ([[Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise]], Sheger, Alliance), [[Light Rail]] or blue and white [[taxi]]s. The taxis are usually [[minibus]]es that can seat at most twelve people, which follow somewhat pre-defined routes. The minibus taxis are typically operated by two people, the driver and a ''[[weyala]]'' who collects fares and calls out the taxi's destination. Sedan taxis work like normal taxis, and are driven to the desired destination on demand. In recent years, new taxi companies have appeared, which uses other designs, including one large company using yellow sedan taxis.\n\n=== Road ===\n\nThe construction of the Addis Ababa Ring Road was initiated in 1998 to implement the city master plan and enhance peripheral development. The Ring Road was divided into three major phases that connect all the five main gates in and out of Addis Ababa with all other regions ([[Jimma]], [[Bishoftu]], [[Dessie]], [[Gojjam]] and [[Ambo, Ethiopia|Ambo]]). For this project, [[China Road and Bridge Corporation]] (CRBC) was the partner of Addis Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT:-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |accessdate=8 December 2010 |title=INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTI-NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Addis Ababa Ring Road Project \u2013 A Case Study of a Chinese ... |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174403/http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT%3A-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Ring Road has greatly helped to decongest and alleviate city traffic.\n\nIntercity bus service is provided by the Lion City Bus Services.\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by [[Addis Ababa Bole International Airport]], where a new terminal opened in 2003. The old Lideta Airport in the western \"Old Airport\" district is used mostly by small craft and military planes and helicopters.{{Dubious|Lideta|date=May 2009}}\n\n=== Railway ===\nAddis Ababa originally had a [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|railway connection]] with [[Djibouti City]], with a picturesque French style railway station, but this route has been abandoned. The new [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]] started operation in September 2016, running parallel to the route of the original railway line.\n\n=== Light rail ===\n[[File: ET Addis asv2018-01 img07 Light Rail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Light rail overpass at Lideta station, Addis Ababa]]\n{{main|Addis Ababa Light Rail}}\n\nAddis Ababa opened its [[Addis Ababa Light Rail|light rail system]] to the public on 20 September 2015. The system is the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Ethiopian Railway Corporation reached a funding agreement worth millions of dollars with the [[Export and Import Bank of China]] in September 2010 and the light rail project was completed in January 2015. The route is a {{convert|34.25|km|adj=on}} network with two lines; the operational line running from the center to the south of the city. Upon completion, the east\u2013west line will run from Ayat to the Torhailoch ring-road, and from Menelik Square to Merkato Bus Station, Meskel Square and Akaki.<ref>{{cite

The suggestion that Barara was located on Mount Entoto is supported by the very recent discovery of a large medieval town overlooking Addis Ababa located between rock-hewn Washa Mikael and the more modern church of Entoto Maryam, founded in the late 19th century by Emperor [[Menelik II|Menelik]].

His interest in the area grew when his wife Taytu began work on a church on Mount Entoto, and Menelik endowed a second church in the area.<ref name=Addis2 /><ref name=Addis1 />\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Mausoleum des Kaisers Menelik I. auf dem H\u00fcgel des grossen Gibi-Abessinienflug 1934-LBS MH02-22-0326.tif|thumb|left|The Te'eka Negist Mausoleum at [[Menelik Palace]] in Addis Ababa, 1934.]]\nHowever, the immediate area did not encourage the founding of a town for lack of [[firewood]] and water, so settlement actually began in the valley south of the mountain in 1886. Initially, Taytu built a house for herself near the \"Filwoha\" hot [[mineral springs]], where she and members of the Showan Royal Court liked to take mineral baths. Other nobility and their staff and households settled in the vicinity, and Menelik expanded his wife's house to become the [[Imperial Palace Addis Ababa|Imperial Palace]] which remains the seat of government in Addis Ababa today. The name changed to Addis Ababa and became Ethiopia's capital when Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia. The town grew by leaps and bounds. One of Emperor Menelik's contributions that are still visible today is the planting of numerous [[eucalyptus]] trees along the city streets.<ref>Pankhurst, p. 195</ref>\n[[File:Selassie_and_Nasser,_1963.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia and President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt in Addis Ababa for the [[Organisation of African Unity]] summit, 1963.]]\nFollowing all the major engagements of [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|their invasion]], [[Fascist Italy (1922\u201343)|Italian]] troops from the colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] entered Addis Ababa on 5 May 1936. Along with [[Dire Dawa]], the city had been spared the aerial bombardment (including the use of [[chemical weapons]] such as [[mustard gas]]) practiced elsewhere and [[Franco-Ethiopian Railway|its railway]] to [[Djibouti]] remained intact. After the occupation the city served as the [[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta|Duke of Aosta]]'s capital for unified [[Italian East Africa]] until 1941, when it was abandoned in favor of [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1941)|Amba Alagi]] and other redoubts during the [[Second World War]]'s [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. The city was liberated by Major [[Orde Wingate]] and negus [[Haile Selassie]] for Ethiopian [[Gideon Force]] and Ethiopian resistance in time to permit Emperor Haile Selassie's return on 5 May 1941, five years to the day after he had left. Following reconstruction, Haile Selassie helped form the [[Organisation of African Unity]] in 1963 and invited the new organization to keep its headquarters in Addis Ababa. The OAU was dissolved in 2002 and replaced by the [[African Union]] (AU), which is also headquartered in the city. The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] also has its headquarters in Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa was also the site of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Council of the Oriental Orthodox Churches]] in 1965.\n\nEthiopia has often been called the original home of mankind because of various humanoid fossil discoveries like the [[Australopithecus|Australopithecine]] [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090512140843/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/5299351/African-tribe-populated-rest-of-the-world.html African tribe from Ethiopia populated rest of the world].</ref> Northeastern Africa, and the [[Afar Region|Afar]] region in particular, was the central focus of these claims until recent DNA evidence suggested origins in south central Ethiopian regions like present-day Addis Ababa.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&sid=awJVkvnk8KjM&refer=australia |archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100312140044/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&sid=awJVkvnk8KjM&refer=australia |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 March 2010 |title=Humans Moved From Africa Across Globe, DNA Study Says | work=Bloomberg | date=21 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_DNA_Links_Humanity_To_One_Common_Origin_Africa_14333.html |title=DNA Links Humanity To One Common Origin: Africa |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914103215/http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_DNA_Links_Humanity_To_One_Common_Origin_Africa_14333.html |archivedate=14 September 2009 }}</ref> After analysing the DNA of almost 1,000 people around the world, geneticists and other scientists claimed people spread from what is now Addis Ababa 100,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/world/15860017.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225143432/http://www.startribune.com/world/15860017.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 February 2008 |title=Around the world from Addis Ababa |publisher=Startribune.com |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsfromrussia.com/news/science/21-02-2008/104190-first_human-0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092113/http://newsfromrussia.com/news/science/21-02-2008/104190-first_human-0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-12-05 |title=New Study Proves Theory of Human Recent African Origin }}</ref> The research indicated that genetic diversity decreases steadily the farther one's ancestors traveled from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022102739.html?hpid=moreheadlines | title=Genetic Mutations Offer Insights on Human Diversity | work=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Brown | date=22 February 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604224751/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022102739.html?hpid=moreheadlines | archive-date=4 June 2011 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bnd.com/news/nation/story/262406.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20071020010637/http://www.bnd.com/news/nation/story/262406.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 20 October 2007 | title = DNA studies trace migration from Ethiopia | accessdate = 6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Addis-Ababa and vicinities, Ethiopia, LandSat-5 false color satellite image, 2011-01-10.jpg|thumb|right|Addis-Ababa and vicinities (false colors satellite image): it is an urbanization strip connecting Addis Ababa and [[Debre Zeyit]] city (at image right bottom corner)]]\n[[File:Addis Ababa SPOT.1003.jpg|thumb|right|Addis Ababa seen from SPOT satellite]]\n[[File:Addis Ababa (district map).png|thumb|right|[[#Subdivision|District map]] of Addis Ababa]]\n\nAddis Ababa lies at an elevation of {{convert|2355|m}} and is a [[grassland]] [[biome]], located at {{Coord|9|1|48|N|38|44|24|E|type:city(2757729)}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |title=NGA: Country Files |publisher=Earth-info.nga.mil |accessdate=5 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504031911/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |archivedate=4 May 2012 }}</ref> The city lies at the foot of [[Mount Entoto]] and forms part of the watershed for the [[Awash River|Awash]].

The high elevation moderates temperatures year-round, and the city's position near the [[equator]] means that temperatures are very constant from month to month. As such the climate would be [[oceanic climate|maritime]] if its elevation was not taken into account, as no month is above {{convert|22|C|F}} in mean temperatures.\n\nMid-November to January is a season for occasional rain. The highland climate regions are characterized by dry winters, and this is the dry season in Addis Ababa. During this season the daily maximum temperatures are usually not more than {{convert|23|\u00b0C}}, and the night-time minimum temperatures can drop to freezing. The short rainy season is from February to May. During this period, the difference between the daytime maximum temperatures and the night-time minimum temperatures is not as great as during other times of the year, with minimum temperatures in the range of {{convert|10|-|15|\u00b0C}}. At this time of the year, the city experiences warm temperatures and a pleasant rainfall. The long wet season is from June to mid-September; it is the major winter season of the country. This period coincides with summer, but the temperatures are much lower than at other times of year because of the frequent rain and hail and the abundance of cloud cover and fewer hours of sunshine. This time of the year is characterized by dark, chilly and wet days and nights. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The autumn which follows is a transitional period between the wet and dry seasons.\n\nThe highest temperature on record was {{convert|30.6|C}} 26 February 2019, while the lowest temperature on record was {{convert|0|C}} recorded on multiple occasions.<ref name=meteoclimat/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Addis Ababa (1981\u20132010, extremes 1898\u2013present)\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 28.8\n|Feb record high C = 30.6\n|Mar record high C = 30.0\n|Apr record high C = 30.2\n|May record high C = 29.5\n|Jun record high C = 29.0\n|Jul record high C = 29.1\n|Aug record high C = 28.0\n|Sep record high C = 25.6\n|Oct record high C = 27.1\n|Nov record high C = 29.5\n|Dec record high C = 26.5\n|year record high C = 30.6\n|Jan high C = 24\n|Feb high C = 24\n|Mar high C = 25\n|Apr high C = 24\n|May high C = 25\n|Jun high C = 23\n|Jul high C = 21\n|Aug high C = 21\n|Sep high C = 22\n|Oct high C = 23\n|Nov high C = 23\n|Dec high C = 23\n|year high C =\n|Jan mean C = 16.0\n|Feb mean C = 16.8\n|Mar mean C = 17.8\n|Apr mean C = 17.8\n|May mean C = 18.2\n|Jun mean C = 16.8\n|Jul mean C = 15.5\n|Aug mean C = 15.6\n|Sep mean C = 16.1\n|Oct mean C = 16.1\n|Nov mean C = 15.4\n|Dec mean C = 15.2\n|year mean C = 16.4\n|Jan low C = 8\n|Feb low C = 9\n|Mar low C = 10\n|Apr low C = 11\n|May low C = 11\n|Jun low C = 10\n|Jul low C = 10\n|Aug low C = 10\n|Sep low C = 10\n|Oct low C = 9\n|Nov low C = 7\n|Dec low C = 7\n|year low =\n|Jan record low C = 0.0\n|Feb record low C = 0.1\n|Mar record low C = 0.0\n|Apr record low C = 2.5\n|May record low C = 4.0\n|Jun record low C = 4.2\n|Jul record low C = 5.4\n|Aug record low C = 5.7\n|Sep record low C = 3.9\n|Oct record low C = 0.0\n|Nov record low C = 0.0\n|Dec record low C = 0.0\n|year record low C = 0.0\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 13\n|Feb rain mm = 30\n|Mar rain mm = 58\n|Apr rain mm = 82\n|May rain mm = 84\n|Jun rain mm = 138\n|Jul rain mm = 280\n|Aug rain mm = 290\n|Sep rain mm = 149\n|Oct rain mm = 27\n|Nov rain mm = 7\n|Dec rain mm = 7\n|year rain mm =\n|unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan rain days = 3\n|Feb rain days = 5\n|Mar rain days = 7\n|Apr rain days = 10\n|May rain days = 10\n|Jun rain days = 20\n|Jul rain days = 27\n|Aug rain days = 26\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 4\n|Nov rain days = 1\n|Dec rain days = 1\n|year rain days =\n|Jan humidity = 52\n|Feb humidity = 51\n|Mar humidity = 53\n|Apr humidity = 59\n|May humidity = 55\n|Jun humidity = 68\n|Jul humidity = 78\n|Aug humidity = 80\n|Sep humidity = 75\n|Oct humidity = 57\n|Nov humidity = 53\n|Dec humidity = 53\n|year humidity = 62\n|Jan sun = 266.6\n|Feb sun = 206.2\n|Mar sun = 241.8\n|Apr sun = 210.0\n|May sun = 238.7\n|Jun sun = 174.0\n|Jul sun = 111.6\n|Aug sun = 133.3\n|Sep sun = 162.0\n|Oct sun = 248.0\n|Nov sun = 267.0\n|Dec sun = 288.3\n|year sun =\n|Jand sun = 8.6\n|Febd sun = 7.3\n|Mard sun = 7.8\n|Aprd sun = 7.0\n|Mayd sun = 7.7\n|Jund sun = 5.8\n|Juld sun = 3.6\n|Augd sun = 4.3\n|Sepd sun = 5.4\n|Octd sun = 8.0\n|Novd sun = 8.9\n|Decd sun = 9.3\n|yeard sun = 7.0\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organisation]] (average high and low, and rainfall)<ref name=WMO>{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/060/c00162.htm\n| title = World Weather Information Service \u2013 Addis Ababa\n| accessdate = 31 March 2019\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organisation\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131022180728/http://worldweather.wmo.int/060/c00162.htm\n| archive-date = 22 October 2013\n| url-status = live\n| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (mean temperatures 1961\u20131990, humidity 1951\u20131990, and sun 1985\u20131998)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_634500_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Addis Abeba (Adis Ababa) / \u00c4thiopien\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961\u20131990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 31 March 2019}}</ref> Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=1837\n| title = Station Addis Abeba\n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat\n| language = French\n| accessdate = 31 March 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the latest 2007 population census conducted by the Ethiopian national statistics authorities, Addis Ababa has a total population of 2,739,551 urban and rural inhabitants.

The other city with the same status is Dire Dawa in the east of the country and both are federal cities.  Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the Transitional Charter of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.\n\nThe administration of Addis Ababa city consists of the Mayor, who leads the executive branch, and the City Council, which enacts city regulations. However, as part of the Federal Government, the federal legislature enacts laws that are binding in Addis Ababa. Members of the City Council are directly elected by the residents of the city and the Council, in turn, elects the Mayor among its members. The term of office for elected officials is five years. However, the Federal Government, when it deems necessary, can dissolve the City Council and the entire administration and replace it by a temporary administration until elections take place next. Residents of Addis Ababa are represented in the federal legislature, the House of Peoples' Representatives. However, the city is not represented in the House of Federation, which is the federal upper house constituted by the representatives of the member states. The executive branch under the Mayor comprises the City Manager and various branches of civil service offices.\n\nThe current Mayor of Addis Ababa is Engineer [[Takele Uma Benti]] from the [[Oromo Democratic Party]], ODP formerly [[Oromo People Democratic Organisation]] (OPDO), which is the member of the ruling coalition Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Engineer Takele Uma took office in 2018. His predecessor, Mr. Dirribaa Kumaa and Kumaa Dammaqsaa (also both from the ODP), were the city's mayor respectively before Takele. Before that, the Federal Government appointed Mr. Berhane Deressa to lead the temporary caretaker administration that served from 9 May 2006 to 30 October 2008 following the 2005 election crisis. In the 2005 national election, the ruling EPRDF party suffered a major defeat in Addis Ababa. However, the opposition who won in Addis Ababa did not take part in the government both on the regional and federal level. This situation forced the EPRDF-led Federal Government to assign a temporary administration until a new election was carried out. As a result, Mr. Berhane Deressa, an independent citizen, was appointed.\n\nSome of the notable past mayors of Addis Ababa are [[Arkebe Oqubay]] (2003\u201306), Zewde Teklu (1985\u201389), Alemu Abebe (1977\u201385) and Zewde Gebrehiwot (1960\u201369).\n\n===Crime===\nAddis Ababa is considered to be extremely safe in comparison to the other cities in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/5-reasons-to-visit-addis-ababa-now-11088|title=5 Reasons to Visit Addis Ababa Now|website=www.fodors.com|access-date=2016-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114235156/http://www.fodors.com/news/5-reasons-to-visit-addis-ababa-now-11088|archive-date=14 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On a crime index, Addis Ababa scores a 44.28, putting it at a crime level of moderate.

A few meters to the southwest of the Anwar Mosque is the Raguel Church built after the liberation by Empress Menen. The proximity of the mosque and the church has symbolized the long peaceful relations between Christianity and Islam in Ethiopia. The Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family is also in the Merkato district. Near [[Bole International Airport]] is the new Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Cathedral, which is the second largest in Africa.\n\nThe [[Entoto Mountains]] start among the northern suburbs. Suburbs of the city include Shiro Meda and [[Entoto]] in the north, Urael and [[Bole Medhanealem|Bole]] (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, [[Nifas Silk]] in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and [[Keranio (Addis Ababa)|Keraniyo]] and [[Kolfe]] in the west. Kolfe was mentioned in [[Nelson Mandela]]'s Autobiography \"A Long Walk to Freedom\", as the place he got military training.\n\nAddis Ababa has a distinct architectural style. Unlike many African cities, Addis Ababa was not built as a colonial settlement. This means that the city has not a European style of architecture. This changed with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. The Piazza district in the city center is the most evident indicator of Italian influence. The buildings are very much Italian in style and there are many Italian restaurants, as well as small cafes, and European-style shopping centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-guides.com/africa/east-africa/ethiopia/ethiopia_addis_ababa.html|title=Ethiopia Capital City, About Addis Ababa Tourism and Travel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115131857/http://www.world-guides.com/africa/east-africa/ethiopia/ethiopia_addis_ababa.html|archive-date=15 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nParks include the [[Africa Park]], which is situated along Menelik II Avenue.\n\nOther features of the city include the large [[Addis Mercato|Mercato]] market, the Jan Meda [[racecourse]], Bihere Tsige Recreation Centre and a railway line to [[Djibouti]].\n\n==Culture==\nThe fossilized skeleton, and a plaster replica of the early hominid [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] (known in Ethiopia as ''Dinkinesh'') is preserved at the [[National Museum of Ethiopia]] in Addis Ababa. [[Meskel Square]] is one of the noted squares in the city and is the site for the annual [[Meskel]] at the end of September annually when thousands gather in celebration.\n\nThe city is home to the [[Ethiopian National Library]], the Ethiopian Ethnological Museum (and [[Guenete Leul Palace|former Guenete Leul Palace]]), the [[Addis Ababa Museum]], the [[Ethiopian Natural History Museum]], the Ethiopian Railway Museum and National Postal Museum.\n\nThere is also [[Menelek II of Ethiopia|Menelik]]'s old [[Imperial Palace Addis Ababa|Imperial palace]] which remains the official seat of government, and the [[National Palace (Ethiopia)|National Palace]] formerly known as the Jubilee Palace (built to mark Emperor Haile Selassie's Silver Jubilee in 1955) which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia. Jubilee Palace was also modeled after Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom. [[Africa Hall]] is located across Menelik II avenue from this Palace and is where the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is headquartered as well as most UN offices in Ethiopia. It is also the site of the founding of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), which eventually became the [[African Union]] (AU). The African Union is now housed in a new headquarters built on the site of the demolished [[Akaki Prison]], on land donated by Ethiopia for this purpose in the south western part of the city. The [[Hager Fikir Theatre]], the oldest theater in Ethiopia, is located at the Piazza district. Near Holy Trinity Cathedral is the art deco Parliament building, built during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, with its clock tower. It continues to serve as the seat of Parliament today. Across from the Parliament is the Shengo Hall, built by the [[Derg]] regime of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its new parliament hall. The Shengo Hall was the world's largest pre-fabricated building, which was constructed in [[Finland]] before being assembled in Addis Ababa. It is used for large meetings and conventions.  [[Taitu Hotel|Itegue Taitu Hotel]], built in 1898 ([[Ethiopian Calendar]]) in the middle of the city (Piazza), was the first hotel in Ethiopia.\n\n==Sport==\nSport facilities include [[Addis Abeba Stadium|Addis Ababa]] and [[Nyala Stadium]]s. The [[2008 African Championships in Athletics]] were held in Addis Ababa.\n\n===Development===\nThe city hosts the We Are the Future center, a child care center that provides children with a higher standard of living. The center is managed under the direction of the mayor's office, and the international NGO [[Glocal Forum]] serves as the fundraiser and program planner and coordinator for the WAF child center in each city. Each WAF city is linked to several peer cities and public and private partners to create a unique international coalition.\n\nLaunched in 2004, the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the [[Quincy Jones]] Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the [[World Bank]], UN agencies and major companies.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Arat Kilo Monument.JPG|Arat Kilo monument\nFile:Ethiopian Commercial Bank Addis Abeba.jpg|Commercial [[Bank of Ethiopia]]\nFile:ET Addis asv2018-01 img01 Meskel Square.jpg|[[Meskel Square]]\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale Saint Georges Addis Abeba1.jpg|[[St George's Cathedral (Addis Ababa)|St George's Cathedral]]\nFile:HagerFikirTheatre.jpg|[[Hager Fikir Theatre]] (April 2006)\nFile:Ethiopian Television.JPG|Ethiopian Radio and Television station\nFile:Ethiopian Federal Police HQ Addis Abeba.JPG|Headquarters of the Ethiopian Federal Police\nFile:Light Rail Traffic Circle.jpg|Light rail overpass at Mexico Square, Addis Ababa\n</gallery>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:ET Addis asv2018-01 img13 University gate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Addis Ababa University]]]]\n[[Addis Ababa University]] was founded in 1950 and was originally named \"University College of Addis Ababa\", then renamed in 1962 for the former Ethiopian emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]] who had donated his Genete Leul Palace to be the university's main campus in the previous year. It is the home of the Institute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum. The city also has numerous public universities and private colleges including [[Addis Ababa Science and Technology University]], [[Ethiopian Civil Service University]], [[Admas University College\u2013Addis Ababa|Admas University College]], [[St. Mary's University (Addis Ababa)|St. Mary's University]], [[Unity University]], Kotebe Metropolitan University and Rift Valley University.\n\n==Transport==\n\n[[File:Bole international airport.jpg|thumb|Bole international airport]]\nPublic transport is through public buses from three different companies ([[Anbessa City Bus Service Enterprise]], Sheger, Alliance), [[Light Rail]] or blue and white [[taxi]]s. The taxis are usually [[minibus]]es that can seat at most twelve people, which follow somewhat pre-defined routes. The minibus taxis are typically operated by two people, the driver and a ''[[weyala]]'' who collects fares and calls out the taxi's destination. Sedan taxis work like normal taxis, and are driven to the desired destination on demand. In recent years, new taxi companies have appeared, which uses other designs, including one large company using yellow sedan taxis.\n\n=== Road ===\n\nThe construction of the Addis Ababa Ring Road was initiated in 1998 to implement the city master plan and enhance peripheral development. The Ring Road was divided into three major phases that connect all the five main gates in and out of Addis Ababa with all other regions ([[Jimma]], [[Bishoftu]], [[Dessie]], [[Gojjam]] and [[Ambo, Ethiopia|Ambo]]). For this project, [[China Road and Bridge Corporation]] (CRBC) was the partner of Addis Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT:-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |accessdate=8 December 2010 |title=INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTI-NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Addis Ababa Ring Road Project \u2013 A Case Study of a Chinese ... |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174403/http://www.pdf-searcher.com/ADDIS-ABABA-RING-ROAD-PROJECT%3A-A-Case-Study-of-a-Chinese-....html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Ring Road has greatly helped to decongest and alleviate city traffic.\n\nIntercity bus service is provided by the Lion City Bus Services.\n\n=== Air ===\n\nThe city is served by [[Addis Ababa Bole International Airport]], where a new terminal opened in 2003. The old Lideta Airport in the western \"Old Airport\" district is used mostly by small craft and military planes and helicopters.{{Dubious|Lideta|date=May 2009}}\n\n=== Railway ===\nAddis Ababa originally had a [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|railway connection]] with [[Djibouti City]], with a picturesque French style railway station, but this route has been abandoned. The new [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]] started operation in September 2016, running parallel to the route of the original railway line.\n\n=== Light rail ===\n[[File: ET Addis asv2018-01 img07 Light Rail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Light rail overpass at Lideta station, Addis Ababa]]\n{{main|Addis Ababa Light Rail}}\n\nAddis Ababa opened its [[Addis Ababa Light Rail|light rail system]] to the public on 20 September 2015. The system is the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Ethiopian Railway Corporation reached a funding agreement worth millions of dollars with the [[Export and Import Bank of China]] in September 2010 and the light rail project was completed in January 2015. The route is a {{convert|34.25|km|adj=on}} network with two lines; the operational line running from the center to the south of the city. Upon completion, the east\u2013west line will run from Ayat to the Torhailoch ring-road, and from Menelik Square to Merkato Bus Station, Meskel Square and Akaki.<ref>{{cite
