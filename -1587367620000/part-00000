The treatment involves  inserting a special microwave urinary catheter into the hyperplastic prostatic urethra. The microwave antenna within the catheter then emits microwaves to heat and destroy the surrounding prostatic tissue.\n\nThe procedure can take from 30 minutes to one hour and is well tolerated by patients. Following the procedure, the prostatic tissue will be swollen and irritated. Urologists often place a [[Foley catheter]] to prevent the patient from having urinary retention. After three to five days the Foley catheter can be replaced by a temporary prostatic stent  to improve voiding without exacerbating irritation symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18374395 | doi=10.1016/j.urology.2007.12.015 | volume=71 | issue=5 | title=Use of a temporary prostatic stent after transurethral microwave thermotherapy reduced voiding symptoms and bother without exacerbating irritative symptoms | date=May 2008 | author=Dineen MK, Shore ND, Lumerman JH, Saslawsky MJ, Corica AP | journal=Urology | pages=873\u20137 }}</ref>\n\n==Risks==\nThe main risks of transurethral microwave thermotherapy include:\n\n* Urinary retention\n* Infection\n* Postprocedural pain\n* [[Retrograde ejaculation]]\n* Intense pain during the procedure\n* Urination pain for several weeks\n\n==Aftercare==\nThe [[International Prostate Symptom Score]] including a [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] survey, is often used to quantify symptoms and to monitor the response to the treatment. Convalescence is relatively rapid, with most patients able to void and a mean recovery time of less than 5 days at home.\n\nHowever, prostatic [[edema]] is expected after microwave therapy, and this can lead to a risk of urinary retention. While some protocols suggest leaving a Foley catheter in for up to 2 weeks in all patients, other urologists are choosing to place a temporary [[prostatic stent]] after the first week following treatment. The stent is worn for 30 days and allows the patient to have volitional voiding with improved quality of life compared to a Foley catheter. Urinary flow generally improves over a few months.\n\nPatients maintained on alpha-blockers after transurethral microwave thermotherapy may experience fewer urinary symptoms and have a decreased incidence of retention.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Neal D.

It is an alternative treatment to pharmacotherapy such as [[alpha blocker]]s, [[transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP), [[transurethral needle ablation of the prostate]], photoselective vaporization of the prostate and prostatic removal or [[prostatectomy]].<ref>Jonathan Rubenstein, MD | Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy of the Prostate (TUMT) http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3070.htm | Feb 6, 2008</ref>\n\n==Process==\nTransurethral microwave thermotherapy is a non-surgical, minimally invasive therapy that can be performed under a local anesthetic on an outpatient basis. The treatment involves  inserting a special microwave urinary catheter into the hyperplastic prostatic urethra. The microwave antenna within the catheter then emits microwaves to heat and destroy the surrounding prostatic tissue.\n\nThe procedure can take from 30 minutes to one hour and is well tolerated by patients. Following the procedure, the prostatic tissue will be swollen and irritated. Urologists often place a [[Foley catheter]] to prevent the patient from having urinary retention. After three to five days the Foley catheter can be replaced by a temporary prostatic stent  to improve voiding without exacerbating irritation symptoms.<ref>Dineen MK, Shore ND, Lumerman JH, Saslawsky MJ, Corica AP (2008 March 26). Use of a Temporary Prostatic Stent After Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy Reduced Voiding Symptoms and Bother Without Exacerbating Irritative Symptoms. {{PMID|18374395}}</ref>\n\n==Risks==\nThe main risks of transurethral microwave thermotherapy include:\n\n* Urinary retention\n* Infection\n* Postprocedural pain\n* [[Retrograde ejaculation]]\n* Intense pain during the procedure\n* Urination pain for several weeks\n\n==Aftercare==\nThe [[International Prostate Symptom Score]] including a [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] survey, is often used to quantify symptoms and to monitor the response to the treatment. Convalescence is relatively rapid, with most patients able to void and a mean recovery time of less than 5 days at home.\n\nHowever, prostatic [[edema]] is expected after microwave therapy, and this can lead to a risk of urinary retention. While some protocols suggest leaving a Foley catheter in for up to 2 weeks in all patients, other urologists are choosing to place a temporary [[prostatic stent]] after the first week following treatment. The stent is worn for 30 days and allows the patient to have volitional voiding with improved quality of life compared to a Foley catheter. Urinary flow generally improves over a few months.\n\nPatients maintained on alpha-blockers after transurethral microwave thermotherapy may experience fewer urinary symptoms and have a decreased incidence of retention.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Neal D.

Upon its release, the song received positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised the singer's full vocal range display and the [[African music]]al undertones.\n\n\"Spirit\" charted at number 98 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 6 on the US [[Hot R&B Songs]] chart, while also entering the charts in numerous European countries. A [[music video]] directed by [[Jake Nava]] was filmed at [[Havasu Falls]] in Arizona and Apple Valley, California and premiered on July 16, 2019. It shows the singer performing a dancing choreography surrounded by African dancers and choristers in a desert-like environment and features a cameo appearance by her daughter, Blue Ivy Carter. Upon its release, the video was positively received by most critics who praised the scenery of the location and the singer's fashion style.\n\n==Background==\nIn a Huffpost interview with [[Hans Zimmer]], he explained that \"Spirit\" was the final addition to the soundtrack and was initially slotted in for the end credits.\n\n\"At the last moment, she comes to the room and basically shows us a diamond and goes, \u2018If you want it, you can have it.\" \"Every musician has a habit of when they come into the room to play you something for the first time ...

He has grown up and established friendly relationships with Timon and Pumbaa. Nala, however, convinces him to return home in order to reclaim the throne that rightfully belongs to him and has been taken by Scar who has allowed the hyenas to overrule the kingdom.

A [[music video]] directed by [[Jake Nava]] was filmed at [[Havasu Falls]] in Arizona and Apple Valley, California and premiered on July 16, 2019. It shows the singer performing a dancing choreography surrounded by African dancers and choristers in a desert-like environment and features a cameo appearance by her daughter, Blue Ivy Carter.

Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day [[Seoul]]. The kingdom's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of [[Amnok River|Amnok]] and [[Tumen River|Tuman]] through the subjugation of the [[Jurchens]]. Joseon was the last dynasty of Korea and its longest-ruling [[Confucian]] dynasty.\n\nDuring its reign, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society. [[Neo-Confucianism]] was installed as the new dynasty's state ideology. [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]] was accordingly discouraged and occasionally faced persecutions by the dynasty. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. However, the dynasty was severely weakened when the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s]] and the [[first Manchu invasion of Korea|first]] and [[Qing invasion of Joseon|second Manchu invasions]] in 1627 and 1636\u20131637 nearly overran the [[Korean Peninsula]], leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as the \"[[hermit kingdom]]\" in [[Western literature]]. After the end of invasions from [[Manchuria]], Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace, prosperity, cultural, and technological development.\n\nHowever, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home, the Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Joseon period has left a substantial legacy to modern Korea; much of modern [[Korean culture]], etiquette, norms, and societal attitudes towards current issues, and [[Korean language|the modern Korean language]] and [[Korean dialects|its dialects]], derive from the culture and traditions of Joseon.\n\n== History ==\n{{History of Korea}}\n{{Main|History of the Joseon dynasty}}\n\n=== Early Joseon period ===\n[[File:King Taejo Yi 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]]'s portrait]]\n\n==== Founding ====\nBy the late 14th century, the nearly 500-year-old [[Goryeo]] established in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and ''de facto'' occupation from the disintegrating [[Mongol Empire]]. Following the emergence of the [[Ming dynasty]], the royal court in Goryeo split into two conflicting factions: the group led by General Yi (supporting the Ming) and the camp led by [[Choe Yeong|General Choe]] (standing by the Yuan).\n\nGoryeo claimed to be the successor of the ancient kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (which was later renamed Goryeo); as such, restoring [[Manchuria]] as part of Korean territory was part of its foreign policy throughout its history. When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388, the 14th year of [[U of Goryeo]], to demand that Goguryeo's former northern territory be handed over to Ming China, General Choe seized the chance to argue for an attack on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]].\n\nYi was chosen to lead the attack; however, he revolted and swept back to Gaegyeong and initiated a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], overthrowing King U in favor of his son, [[Chang of Goryeo]] (1388). He later killed King U and his son after a failed restoration and forcibly placed a royal named Yi on the throne (he became [[Gongyang of Goryeo]]). In 1392, Yi eliminated [[Jeong Mong-ju]], highly respected leader of a group loyal to Goryeo dynasty, and dethroned King Gongyang, exiling him to [[Wonju]], and before he ascended the throne. The Goryeo Dynasty had come to an end after almost 500 years of rule.\n\nIn the beginning of his reign, Yi Seonggye, now ruler of Korea, intended to continue use of the name Goryeo for the country he ruled and simply change the royal line of descent to his own, thus maintaining the fa\u00e7ade of continuing the 500-year-old Goryeo tradition. However, after numerous threats of mutiny from the drastically weakened but still influential Gwonmun nobles, who continued to swear allegiance to the remnants of the Goryeo and now the demoted Wang clan, the consensus in the reformed court was that a new dynastic title was needed to signify the change. In naming the new dynasty, Taejo contemplated two possibilities - \"Hwaryeong\" and \"Joseon\". After much internal deliberation, as well as endorsement by the neighboring Ming dynasty's emperor, Taejo declared the name of the kingdom to be Joseon, a tribute to the ancient Korean state of [[Gojoseon]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Kang|first= Jae-eun|date= 2006|title= The Land of Scholars: Two Thousand Years of Korean Confucianism|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XB4UYXNQK1wC&dq=ming+taizu+joseon|publisher= Homa & Sekey Books|page= 177|access-date= August 7, 2015|isbn= 9781931907309}} \"Yi Seong-gye issued a royal edict to proclaim the name of the new dynasty to \"Joseon\" and issued amnesty to all criminals who opposed the transition in dynasty. The statement by Taizu about \"only the name of Joseon is beautiful and old\" naturally refers to Gija Joseon.\"</ref> He also moved the capital to [[Seoul|Hanyang]] from Kaesong.\n\n==== Strife of princes ====\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-GeunJeongJeon.jpg|thumb|left|The Throne Hall at [[Gyeongbokgung]]]]\n{{Joseon Dynasty monarchs}}\n\nWhen the new dynasty was promulgated and officially brought into existence, Taejo brought up the issue of which son would be his successor. Although Yi Bangwon, Taejo's fifth son by Queen Sineui, had contributed most to assisting his father's rise to power, the prime minister [[Jeong Dojeon]] and [[Nam Eun]] used their influence on King Taejo to name his eighth son (second son of Queen Sindeok) Grand Prince Uian (Yi Bangseok) as crown prince in 1392. This conflict arose largely because Jeong Dojeon, who shaped and laid down ideological, institutional, and legal foundations of the new dynasty more than anyone else, saw Joseon as a kingdom led by ministers appointed by the king while Yi Bangwon wanted to establish the absolute monarchy ruled directly by the king. With Taejo's support, Jeong Dojeon kept limiting the royal family's power by prohibiting political involvement of princes and attempting to abolish their private armies. Both sides were well aware of each other's great animosity and were getting ready to strike first.\n\nAfter the sudden death of Queen Sindeok, while King Taejo was still in mourning for his second wife, Yi Bangwon struck first by raiding the palace and killed Jeong Dojeon and his supporters as well as Queen Sindeok's two sons (his half-brothers) including the crown prince in 1398. This incident became known as the First Strife of Princes.\n\nAghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the crown, and psychologically exhausted from the death of his second wife, King Taejo abdicated and immediately crowned his second son Yi Banggwa as [[Jeongjong of Joseon|King Jeongjong]]. One of King Jeongjong's first acts as monarch was to revert the capital to [[Kaesong]], where he is believed to have been considerably more comfortable, away from the toxic power strife. Yet Yi Bangwon retained real power and was soon in conflict with his disgruntled older brother, Yi Banggan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, the tensions between Yi Bangwon's faction and Yi Banggan's camp escalated into an all-out conflict that came to be known as the Second Strife of Princes. In the aftermath of the struggle, the defeated Yi Banggan was exiled to [[Tosan County|Dosan]] while his supporters were executed. Thoroughly intimidated, King Jeongjong immediately invested Yi Bangwon as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Bangwon assumed the throne of Joseon at long last as [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]], third king of Joseon.\n\n====Consolidation of royal power====\nIn the beginning of Taejong's reign, the Grand King Former, Taejo, refused to relinquish the royal seal that signified the legitimacy of any king's rule. Taejong began to initiate policies he believed would prove his qualification to rule. One of his first acts as king was to abolish the privilege enjoyed by the upper echelons of government and the aristocracy to maintain private armies. His revoking of such rights to field independent forces effectively severed their ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of men employed in the national military. Taejong's next act as king was to revise the existing legislation concerning the taxation of land ownership and the recording of state of subjects. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national income increased twofold.\n\nIn 1399, Taejong had played an influential role in scrapping the [[Dopyeong Assembly]], a council of the old government administration that held a monopoly in court power during the waning years of the Goryeo Dynasty, in favor of the [[State Council of Joseon]] ({{Hangul|\uc758\uc815\ubd80}} {{Hanja|\u8b70\u653f\u5e9c}}), a new branch of central administration that revolved around the king and his edicts. After passing the subject documentation and taxation legislation, King Taejong issued a new decree in which all decisions passed by the State Council could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom of court ministers and advisors making decisions through debate and negotiations amongst themselves, and thus brought the royal power to new heights.\n\nShortly thereafter, Taejong installed an office, known as the [[Sinmun Office]], to hear cases in which aggrieved subjects felt that they had been exploited or treated unjustly by government officials or [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s. However, Taejong kept Jeong Dojeon's reforms intact for most part. In addition, Taejong executed or exiled many of his supporters who helped him ascend on the throne in order to strengthen the royal authority. To limit influence of in-laws, he also killed all four of his Queen's brothers and his son [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]]'s father-in-law. Taejong remains a controversial figure who killed many of his rivals and relatives to gain power and yet ruled effectively to improve the populace's lives, strengthen national defense, and lay down a solid foundation for his successor Sejong's rule.\n\n====Sejong the Great====\n[[File:\uc601\uc758\uc815\ud558\uc5f0\ubd80\ubd80\uc601\uc8153.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Ha Yeon]] who served as [[Yeonguijeong]] during the [[Sejong of Joseon|King Sejong]]'s reign.]]\n[[File:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|right|A page from the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Eonhae'', a partial translation of ''[[Hunminjeongeum]]'', the original promulgation of the Korean alphabet]]\n\nIn August 1418, following Taejong's abdication two months earlier, [[Sejong the Great]] ascended the throne. In May 1419, King Sejong, under the advice and guidance of his father Taejong, embarked upon the [[\u014cei Invasion|Gihae Eastern Expedition]] to remove the nuisance of [[Wokou|waegu]] (coastal pirates) who had been operating out of [[Tsushima Island]].\n\nIn September 1419, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of Tsushima, Sadamori, capitulated to the Joseon court. In 1443, The [[Treaty of Gyehae]] was signed in which the ''daimy\u014d'' of Tsushima was granted rights to conduct trade with Korea in fifty ships per year in exchange for sending tribute to Korea and aiding to stop any Waegu coastal pirate raids on Korean ports.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Korea | last= Richard Rutt.| publisher= Routledge/Curzon| date= September 1999|isbn=978-0-7007-0464-4|url= https://books.google.com/?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&pg=PA255&dq=kyehae+treaty&q=kyehae%20treaty|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title= The Cambridge history of Japan |volume=3 |trans-title= Medieval Japan |last= John W.

In 1433, Sejong sent [[Kim Jong-seo (general)|Kim Jong-seo]], a government official, north to fend off the Jurchens.

He was succeeded by his twelve-year-old son, [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]]. In addition to two regents, [[Princess Gyeonghye]] also served as Danjong's guardian and, along with the general Kim Jongso, attempted to strengthen royal authority.<ref name=\"an\">{{cite web |url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/05/628_153138.html |title=Forgotten story of Princess Gyeonghye |last1=An|first1=Seung-jun|website=Korea Times|date=4 April 2014|access-date=22 February 2018 }}</ref> However, Danjong's uncle, [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]], gained control of the government and eventually deposed his nephew to become the seventh king of Joseon himself in 1455. After [[Six martyred ministers|six ministers loyal to Danjong]] attempted to assassinate Sejo to return Danjong to the throne, Sejo executed the six ministers and also killed Danjong in his place of exile.\n\nKing Sejo enabled the government to determine exact population numbers and to mobilize troops effectively. He also revised the land ordinance to improve the national economy and encouraged publication of books. Most importantly, he compiled the Grand Code for State Administration, which became the cornerstone of dynastic administration and provided the first form of constitutional law in a written form in Korea.\n\nHowever, he undermined much foundation of the many systems including the Jiphyeonjeon which his predecessors King Sejong and Munjong had carefully laid down, cutting down on everything he deemed unworthy of the effort and thus caused countless complications in the long run. Much of his own adjustments were done for his own power, not regarding the consequences and problems that would occur. Furthermore, the relentless favoritism which he showed towards the ministers who aided him in the taking of the throne led to much corruption in the higher echelon of the political field.\n\n====Institutional arrangements and Prosper culture====\nSejo's weak son [[Yejong of Joseon|Yejong]] succeeded him as the eighth king, but died two years later in 1469. Yejong's nephew [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] ascended the throne. His reign was marked by the prosperity and growth of the national economy and the rise of neo-Confucian scholars called [[sarim]] who were encouraged by Seongjong to enter court politics. He established Hongmungwan ({{hanja|\u5f18\u6587\u9928}}), the royal library and advisory council composed of Confucian scholars, with whom he discussed philosophy and government policies. He ushered in a cultural golden age that rivaled Sejong's reign by publishing numerous books on geography, ethics, and various other fields.\n\nHe also sent several military campaigns against the Jurchens on the northern border in 1491, like many of his predecessors. The campaign, led by General [[Heo Jong]], was successful, and the defeated Jurchens, led by the Udige clan ({{hanja|\u5140\u72c4\u54c8}}), retreated to the north of the [[Yalu River]]. King Seongjong was succeeded by his son, [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsangun]], in 1494.\n\n====Literati purges====\n{{Main|Korean literati purges}}\n[[File:Cho Kwang-jo in 1750.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the neo-Confucian scholar, [[Jo Gwang-jo]] \uc870\uad11\uc870 (1482\u20131519)]]\n\n[[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsangun]] is often considered the worst tyrant of the Joseon, whose reign was marked by [[Korean literati purges]] between 1498 and 1506. His behavior became erratic after he learned that his biological mother was not Queen Junghyeon but the [[deposed Queen Lady Yun]], who was forced to drink poison after poisoning one of Seongjong's concubines out of jealousy and leaving a scratch mark on Seongjong's face. When he was shown a piece of clothing that was allegedly stained with his mother's blood vomited after drinking poison, he beat to death two of Seongjong's concubines who had accused Consort Yun and he pushed Grand Queen Insu, who died afterward. He executed government officials who supported Consort Yun's death along with their families. He also executed [[sarim]] scholars for writing phrases critical of Sejo's usurpation of the throne.\n\nYeonsangun also seized a thousand women from the provinces to serve as palace entertainers and appropriated the [[Sungkyunkwan]] as a personal pleasure ground. He abolished the Office of Censors, whose function was to criticize inappropriate actions and policies of the king, and Hongmungwan. He banned the use of hangul when the common people wrote with it on posters criticizing the king. After twelve years of misrule, he was finally deposed in a coup that placed his half-brother [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]] on the throne in 1506.\n\nJungjong was a fundamentally weak king because of the circumstances that placed him on the throne, but his reign also saw a period of significant reforms led by his minister [[Jo Gwang-jo]], the charismatic leader of sarim. He established a local self-government system called [[hyangyak]] to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit among the people, sought to reduce the gap between the rich and poor with a land reform that would distribute land to farmers more equally and limit the amount of land and number of slaves that one could own, promulgated widely among the populace Confucian writings with vernacular translations, and sought to trim the size of government by reducing the number of bureaucrats. According to the ''[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty]]'', it was said that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because as Inspector General, he applied law strictly.\n\nThese radical reforms were very popular with the populace but were fiercely opposed by the conservative officials who helped to put Jungjong on the throne. They plotted to cause Jungjong to doubt Jo's loyalty. Jo Gwangjo was executed, and most of his reform measures died with him in the resulting [[Korean literati purges#Third Literati Purge of 1519|Third Literati Purge of 1519]]. For nearly 50 years afterward, the court politics was marred by bloody and chaotic struggles between factions backing rival consorts and princes. In-laws of the royal family wielded great power and contributed to much corruption in that era.\n\n===Middle Joseon period===\n[[File:\uc815\ucca0.jpg|thumb|[[Jeong Cheol]] \uc815\ucca0 (1536-1593), head of the Western faction]]\n\nThe middle period of Joseon dynasty was marked by a series of intense and bloody power struggles between political factions that weakened the country and large-scale invasions by Japan and Manchu that nearly toppled the dynasty.\n\n====Factional struggle====\n{{Main|Political factions in Joseon dynasty}}\n\nThe [[Sarim]] faction had suffered a series of political defeats during the reigns of Yeonsangun, Jungjong, and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]], but it gained control of the government during the reign of [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]. It soon split into opposing factions known as the [[Easterners]] and the [[Westerners (Korean political faction)|Westerners]]. Within decades the Easterners themselves divided into the [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southerners]] and the [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northerners]]; in the seventeenth century the Westerners as well permanently split into the [[Noron (Korean political faction)|Noron]] and the [[Soron (Korean political faction)|Soron]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrey |first1=Patricia |last2=Walthall |first2=Ann |date= 2013 |title= East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Volume II: From 1600 |url=  https://books.google.com/?id=5pLGIcp4PMgC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq=patriarchs+joseon+faction#v=onepage&q=patriarchs%20joseon%20faction&f=false |publisher= Cengage Learning|page= 255 |isbn= 978-1133606499|access-date= July 15, 2015}}</ref> The alternations in power among these factions were often accompanied by charges of treason and bloody purges, initiating a cycle of revenge with each change of regime.\n\nOne example is the [[1589 rebellion of Jeong Yeo-rip]], one of the bloodiest political purges of Joseon. Jeong Yeo-rip, an Easterner, had formed a society with group of supporters that also received military training to fight against [[Wokou|Waegu]]. There is still a dispute about the nature and purpose of his group, which reflected desire for classless society and spread throughout [[Honam]]. He was subsequently accused of conspiracy to start a rebellion. [[Jeong Cheol]], head of the Western faction, was in charge of investigating the case and used this event to effect widespread purge of Easterners who had slightest connection with Jeong Yeo-rip. Eventually 1000 Easterners were killed or exiled in the aftermath.\n\n====Early Japanese invasions====\n{{Main|Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)}}\n[[File:Turtle boat.jpg|thumb|A [[turtle ship]].

The only purpose for the Joseon navy was to secure the maritime trade against the [[wokou]]. The navy repelled pirates using an advanced form of gunpowder technologies including cannons and [[fire arrows]] in form of [[singijeon]] deployed by [[hwacha]].\n\nDuring the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)|Japanese invasions in the 1590s]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], plotting the conquest of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] with [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] guns, invaded Korea with his ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and their troops, intending to use Korea as a stepping stone. Factional division in the Joseon court, inability to assess Japanese military capability, and failed attempts at diplomacy led to poor preparation on Joseon's part. The use of European firearms by the Japanese left most of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula occupied within months, with both [[Hanseong]] (present-day [[Seoul]]) and [[Pyongyang]] captured.\n\nHowever, the invasion was slowed when Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] destroyed the Japanese invasion fleet. The guerrilla resistance that eventually formed also helped. Local resistance slowed down the Japanese advance and decisive naval victories by Admiral Yi left control over sea routes in Korean hands, severely hampering Japanese supply lines. Furthermore, Ming China intervened on the side of the Koreans, sending a large force in 1593 which pushed back the Japanese together with the Koreans.\n\nDuring the war, Koreans developed powerful firearms and the [[turtle ship]]s. The Joseon and Ming forces defeated the Japanese at a deep price. Following the war, relations between Korea and Japan were completely suspended until 1609.\n\n====Manchu invasions====\n{{see also|First Manchu invasion of Korea|Second Manchu invasion of Korea}}\n[[File:Jurchen warriors.jpg|thumb|left|A Korean painting depicting two Jurchen warriors and their horses]]\n\nAfter the Japanese invasions, the Korean Peninsula was devastated. Meanwhile, [[Nurhaci]] (r. 1583&ndash;1626), the chieftain of the [[Jianzhou Jurchens]], was unifying the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes of [[Manchuria]] into a strong coalition that his son [[Hong Taiji]] (r. 1626-&ndash;1643) would eventually rename the \"Manchus.\" After he declared [[Seven Grievances]] against Ming China in 1618, Nurhaci and the Ming engaged in several military conflicts. On such occasions, Nurhaci required help from [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] (r.1608&ndash;1623), putting the Korean state in a difficult position because the Ming court was also requesting assistance.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}.</ref> Gwanghaegun tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting Ming China, which had saved Joseon during Hideyoshi's invasions.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\"/>\n\nIn 1623, Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon]] (r. 1623&ndash;1649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters.

Joseon witnessed the emergence of [[Silhak]] (Practical Learning). The early group of Silhak scholars advocated comprehensive reform of civil service examination, taxation, natural sciences and the improvement in agromanagerial and agricultural techniques. It aimed to rebuild Joseon society after it had been devastated by the two invasions. Under the leadership of [[Kim Yuk]], the chief minister of [[Hyeonjong of Joseon|King Hyeonjong]], the implementation of reforms proved highly advantageous both to state revenues and to the lot of the peasants.\n\nFactional conflict grew particularly intense under the reigns of the kings [[Sukjong of Joseon|Sukjong]] and [[Gyeongjong of Joseon|Gyeongjong]], with major rapid reversals of the ruling faction, known as *hwanguk* (\u63db\u5c40; literally ''change in the state of affairs''), being commonplace. As a response, the next kings, [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]], generally pursued the ''Tangpyeongchaek'' - a policy of maintaining balance and equality between the factions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title= \ud0d5\ud3c9\ucc45 |encyclopedia= \ud55c\uad6d\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc774\uc131\ubb34| date   = November 12, 2007| title     = \uc870\uc120\ub2f9\uc7c1\uc0ac 2 \ud0d5\ud3c9\uacfc \uc138\ub3c4\uc815\uce58: \uc219\uc885\uc870~\uace0\uc885\uc870| publisher = \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4\ub0a0 | isbn = 9788989354833}}</ref>\n\nThe two kings led a second renaissance of the Joseon dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Korea|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&pg=PT98#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=23 December 2016|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beirne|first1=Paul|title=Su-un and His World of Symbols: The Founder of Korea's First Indigenous Religion|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317047490|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OPeCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT38#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=23 December 2016|language=en}}</ref> Yeongjo's grandson, the enlightened King Jeongjo enacted various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing Gyujanggak, a royal library in order to improve the cultural and political position of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to run the nation. King Jeongjo also spearheaded bold social initiatives, opening government positions to those who would previously have been barred because of their social status. King Jeongjo had the support of the many Silhak scholars, who supported his regal power. King Jeongjo's reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture. At that time, the group of Silhak scholars encouraged the individual to reflect on state traditions and lifestyle, initiating the studies of Korea that addressed its history, geography, [[epigraphy]] and language.\n\n====Government by in-law families====\nAfter the death of King Jeongjo, the Joseon faced difficult external and internal problems. Internally, the foundation of national law and order weakened as a result of \"Sedo\" politics (in-law government) by royal in-law family.\n\nYoung [[Sunjo of Joseon|King Sunjo]] succeeded King Jeongjo in 1800. With Jeongjo's death the [[Intransigents (Joseon faction)|Intransigent Patriarch faction]] seized power with the regency of [[Queen Jeongsun|Queen Dowager Jeongsun]], whose family had strong ties to the Intransigents, and initiated a [[Catholic Persecution of 1801|persecution of Catholics]]. But after the retirement and death of the Queen Dowager, the Intransigents were gradually ousted and the Expedient faction, including the Andong Kim family of [[Kim Jo-sun]], the father of the queen, gained power. Gradually the Andong Kims came to dominate the court.<ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc624\uc601\uad50| date   = July 25, 2007| title     = \uc138\ub3c4\uc815\uad8c\uae30 \uc870\uc120\uc0ac\ud68c\uc640 \ub300\uc804\ud68c\ud1b5| publisher = \ud61c\uc548 | isbn = 9788984943131}}</ref>\n\nWith the domination of the Andong Kims, the era of *sedo politics* or in-law rule began. The formidable in-law lineage monopolized the vital positions in government, holding sway over the political scene, and intervening in the succession of the throne. These kings had no monarchic authority and could not rule over the government. The yangban of other families, overwhelmed by the power exercised by the royal in-laws, could not speak out. As the power was concentrated in the hands of the royal in-law lineage, there was disorder in the governing process and corruption became rampant. Large sums were offered in bribes to the powerful lineages to obtain positions with nominally high rank. Even the low-ranking posts were bought and sold. This period, which spanned 60 years, saw the manifestation of both severe poverty among the Korean population and ceaseless rebellions in various parts of the country.\n\nExternally, Joseon became increasingly [[isolationist]]. Its rulers sought to limit contact with foreign countries.\n\n==== End of the dynasty ====\n[[File:\uc774\ud558\uc751 \ucd08\uc0c1.jpg|thumb|[[Heungseon Daewongun]] \ud765\uc120 \ub300\uc6d0\uad70(\uc774\ud558\uc751)]]\n<!--[[File:Flag of Korea 1882.svg|thumb|upright|The Joseon flag from 1882 to 1897]]-->\n\nIn 1863 [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] took the throne. His father, Regent [[Heungseon Daewongun]], ruled for him until Gojong reached adulthood. During the mid-1860s the Regent was the main proponent of isolationism and the instrument of the persecution of native and foreign Catholics, a policy that led directly to the [[French campaign against Korea|French Campaign against Korea]] in 1866. The early years of his rule also witnessed a large effort to restore the dilapidated [[Gyeongbok Palace]], the seat of royal authority. During his reign, the power and authority of the in-law families such as the Andong Kims sharply declined. In order to get rid of the Andong Kim and Pungyang Cho families, he promoted persons without making references to political party or family affiliations, and in order to reduce the burdens of the people and solidify the basis of the nation's economy, he reformed the tax system. [[United States expedition to Korea|In 1871, U.S. and Korean forces clashed]] in a U.S. attempt at \"gunboat diplomacy\" following on the [[General Sherman incident]] of 1866.\n\nIn 1873, King Gojong announced his assumption of royal rule. With the subsequent retirement of Heungseon Daewongun, the future Queen Min (later called [[Empress Myeongseong]]) became a power in the court, placing her family in high court positions.\n\nJapan, after the [[Meiji Restoration]], acquired Western military technology, and forced Joseon to sign the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] in 1876, opening three ports to trade and granting the Japanese extraterritoriality. [[Port Hamilton Incident|Port Hamilton was occupied]] by the British Navy in 1885.\n\n[[File:Portrait_of_Gojong_01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]]]]\nMany Koreans despised Japanese and foreign influences over their land and the corrupt oppressive rule of the Joseon Dynasty. In 1881, the ''[[Byeolgigun]]'', a modern elite military unit, was formed with Japanese trainers. The salaries of the other soldiers were held back and in 1882 [[Imo incident|rioting soldiers]] attacked the Japanese officers and even forced the queen to take refuge in the countryside. In 1894, the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] saw farmers rise up in a mass rebellion, with peasant leader [[Jeon Bong-jun]] defeating the forces of local ruler Jo Byong-gap at the battle of [[Jeongeup|Go-bu]] on January 11, 1894; after the battle, Jo's properties were handed out to the peasants. By May, the peasant army had reached [[Jeonju]], and the Joseon government asked the [[Qing dynasty]] government for assistance in ending the revolt. The Qing sent 3,000 troops and the rebels negotiated a truce, but the Japanese considered the Qing presence a threat and sent in 8,000 troops of their own, seizing the Royal Palace in Seoul and installing a pro-Japanese government on 8 June 1894. This soon escalated into the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895) between Japan and Qing China, fought largely in Korea. [*The king made a deal with Japan partially out of isolationist views and conservative-misogynistic distrust of the queen's support for open trade policies towards the Western civilizations and China.  He ended up preempting a specific disadvantageous, exclusive negotiation with Japan previous to the Queen's decision, which was later used as a political premise for Japan to wage military action.  Scholars particularly during the Joseon era were touted for expressing allegiance to the king]\n\n[[Empress Myeongseong]] (referred to as \"Queen Min\"<ref name=\"queen min\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/11/10/106073098.pdf Characteristics of Queen of Corea] ''[[The New York Times]]'' November 10, 1895</ref>) had attempted to counter Japanese interference in Korea and was considering turning to the [[Russian Empire]] or to China for support. In 1895, Empress Myeongseong was assassinated by Japanese agents.<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\"/><ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\">{{cite news|url=http://www.donga.com/docs/magazine/shin/2004/11/09/200411090500053/200411090500053_1.html |script-title=ko:\uc77c\ubcf8\uc778 \ud3ed\ub3c4\uac00 \uac00\uc2b4\uc744 \uc138 \ubc88 \uc9d3\ubc1f\uace0 \uc77c\ubcf8\ub3c4\ub85c \ub09c\uc790\ud588\ub2e4 |newspaper=[[Dong-a Ilbo]] |author=Park Jong-hyo (\ubc15\uc885\ud6a8), former professor at [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]] |date= 2002-01-01 |issue= 508 |pages=472 ~ 485|language=Korean}}</ref> The Japanese minister to Korea, [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Viscount]] [[Miura Gor\u014d|Miura]], almost certainly orchestrated the plot against her.

It was a step toward Japan gaining regional [[hegemony]] in Korea. The Joseon court, pressured by encroachment from larger powers, felt the need to reinforce national integrity and declared the '''[[Korean Empire]]''', along with the [[Gwangmu Reform]] in 1897. [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] assumed the title of [[Emperor of Korea|Emperor]] in order to assert Korea's independence. In addition, other foreign powers were sought for military technology, especially Russia, to fend off the Japanese. Technically, 1897 marks the end of the Joseon period, as the official name of the empire was changed; however the Joseon Dynasty would still reign, albeit perturbed by Japan and Russia.\n\nIn a complicated series of maneuvers and counter-maneuvers, Japan pushed back the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] in 1905. With the conclusion of the 1904\u20131905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], the way was open for Japan to take control of Korea. After the signing of the [[Eulsa Treaty|Protectorate Treaty]] in 1905, Korea became a [[protectorate]] of Japan. [[Prince]] [[It\u014d Hirobumi|It\u014d]] was the first [[Resident-General of Korea]], although he was assassinated by [[Korean independence activist]] [[An Jung-geun]] in 1909 at the train station at [[Harbin]]. In 1910 the [[Japanese Empire]] finally [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] Korea.\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Joseon Dynasty politics}}\n\nJoseon dynasty was a highly centralized monarchy and neo-Confucian bureaucracy as codified by [[Gyeongguk daejeon]], a sort of Joseon constitution.\n\n===King===\n{{see also|List of Joseon monarchs|House of Yi#House of Yi family tree|#Titles_and_styles_during_Joseon_Kingdom|label 2=Joseon kings family tree|label 3= Royal titles and styles during the Joseon Period}}\n[[File:Seoul Gyeongbokgung Throne.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Phoenix Throne]] of the king of Joseon in [[Gyeongbokgung]]]]\n[[File:Flag of the king of Joseon.svg|thumb|upright|[[List of Korean flags|Royal standard of the King of Joseon]]]]\nThe king had absolute authority, but his actual power varied with political circumstances. He was bound by tradition, precedents set by earlier kings, [[Gyeongguk daejeon]], and Confucian teachings. The king commanded absolute loyalty from his officials and subjects, but the officials were also expected to persuade the king to the right path if the latter was thought to be mistaken. The natural disasters were thought to be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences. When there was severe drought or a series of disasters, the king often formally sought criticism from both the officials and citizenry, and whatever they said or wrote were protected from prosecution in such cases (although there were few exceptions).\n\nDirect communication between the king and the common people was possible through the ''sangeon'' ({{Korean|hangul=\uc0c1\uc5b8|hanja=\u4e0a\u8a00|labels=no}}) written petition system and the ''gyeokjaeng'' ({{Korean|hangul=\uaca9\uc7c1|hanja=\u64ca\u931a|labels=no}}) oral petition system. Through the ''gyeokjaeng'' oral petition system, commoners could strike a gong or drum in front of the palace or during the king's public processions in order to appeal their grievances or petition to the king directly. This allowed even the illiterate members of Joseon society to make a petition to the king. More than 1,300 ''gyeokjaeng''-related accounts are recorded in the [[Ilseongnok]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ilseongnok: Records of Daily Reflections|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/Korea%20Ilseongnok.pdf|website=Memory of the World Register|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Injae|first1=Lee|last2=Miller|first2=Owen|last3=Jinhoon|first3=Park|last4=Hyun-Hae|first4=Yi|title=Korean History in Maps|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107098466|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46OTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=6 December 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\uc0c1\uc5b8\uaca9\uc7c1|url=http://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?content_id=cp021002840001|website=\ubb38\ud654\ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub2f7\ucef4|publisher=Korea Creative Content Agency|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\nThe government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from first senior rank (\uc8151\ud488, \u6b63\u4e00\u54c1) down to ninth junior rank (\uc8859\ud488, \u5f9e\u4e5d\u54c1) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examination or recommendation. The officials from 1st senior rank to 3rd senior rank wore red robes while those from 3rd junior rank to 6th junior rank wore blue and those below wore green robes.<ref>[[Gyeongguk daejeon]]</ref>\n\nHere a government official refers to one who occupied a type of office that gave its holder a [[yangban]] status - semi-hereditary nobility that was effective for three generations. In order to become such an official, one had to pass a series of [[gwageo]] examinations. There were three kinds of gwageo exams - literary, military, and miscellaneous, among which literary route was the most prestigious. (Many of key posts including all [[#Three Offices|Censorate]] posts were open only to officials who advanced through literary exam.) In case of literary route, there was a series of four tests, all of which one had to pass in order to qualify to become an official. 33 candidates who were chosen in this manner took the final exam before the king for placement. The candidate with the highest score was appointed to a position of 6th junior rank (a jump of six ranks). Two candidates with the next two highest scores were appointed to a position of 7th junior rank. Seven candidates with next highest scores were assigned to 8th junior rank while the remaining 23 candidates were given 9th junior rank, the lowest of 18 ranks.\n\nThe officials of 1st senior rank, 1st junior rank, and 2nd senior rank were addressed with honorific \"dae-gam\" (\ub300\uac10, \u5927\u76e3) while those of 2nd junior rank and 3rd senior rank were addressed with honorific \"[[yeong-gam]]\" (\uc601\uac10, \u4ee4\u76e3).<ref>Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies, \"About Rank of Joseon Officials\"</ref> These red-robed officials, collectively called \"dangsanggwan\" (\ub2f9\uc0c1\uad00, \u5802\u4e0a\u5b98), took part in deciding government policies by attending cabinet meetings. The rest of ranked officials were called \"danghagwan\" (\ub2f9\ud558\uad00, \u5802\u4e0b\u5b98).\n\n===Central government===\n\n====State Council====\n[[File:Joseon-Portrait_of_Cha_Jegong-Geumgwanjobok.jpg|thumb|Portrait of The Chief State Councillor [[Yeongeuijeong|Chae Jegong]] (1720~1799)]]\n\n[[State Council of Joseon|State Council]] (Uijeongbu, \uc758\uc815\ubd80, \u8b70\u653f\u5e9c) was the highest deliberative body, whose power however declined over the course of dynasty. The Chief State Councillor ([[Yeonguijeong]], \uc601\uc758\uc815, \u9818\u8b70\u653f), Left State Councillor ([[Jwauijeong]], \uc88c\uc758\uc815, \u5de6\u8b70\u653f), and Right State Councillor (Uuijeong, \uc6b0\uc758\uc815, \u53f3\u8b70\u653f) were the highest-ranking officials in the government (All three were of 1st senior rank). They were assisted by Left Minister (Jwachanseong, \uc88c\ucc2c\uc131, \u5de6\u8d0a\u6210) and Right Minister (Uichangseong, \uc6b0\ucc2c\uc131, \u53f3\u8d0a\u6210), both of 1st junior rank, and seven lower ranking officials. The power of State Council was inversely proportional to the king's power. There were periods when it directly controlled [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]], the chief executive body of Joseon government, but it primarily served in advisory role under stronger kings. State councillors served in several other positions concurrently.\n\n====Six Ministries====\n[[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] (Yukjo, \uc721\uc870, \u516d\u66f9) make up the chief executive body. Each minister (Panseo, \ud310\uc11c, \u5224\u66f8) was of 2nd senior rank and was assisted by deputy minister (Champan, \ucc38\ud310, \u53c3\u5224), who was of 2nd junior rank. Ministry of Personnel was the most senior office of six ministries. As the influence of State Council waned over time, Minister of Personnel was often de facto head of ministers. Six ministries include in the order of seniority.\n\n:*Ministry of Personnel (Ijo, \uc774\uc870, \u540f\u66f9) - was primarily concerned with appointment of officials\n:*Ministry of Taxation (Hojo, \ud638\uc870, \u6236\u66f9) - taxation, finances, census, agriculture, and land policies\n:*Ministry of Rites (Yejo, \uc608\uc870, \u79ae\u66fa) - rituals, culture, diplomacy, gwageo exam\n:*Ministry of Defence (Byeongjo, \ubcd1\uc870, \u5175\u66fa) - military affairs\n:**Office of Police Bureau ([[Podocheong]], \ud3ec\ub3c4\uccad, \u6355\u76dc\u5ef3) - office for public order\n:*Ministry of Justice (Hyeongjo, \ud615\uc870, \u5211\u66fa) - administration of law, slavery, punishments\n:*Ministry of Commerce (Gongjo, \uacf5\uc870, \u5de5\u66f9) - industry, public works, manufacturing, mining\n\n====Three Offices====\n[[Three Offices]], or ''Samsa'' (\uc0bc\uc0ac), is a collective name for three offices that functioned as major organ of press and provided checks and balance on the king and the officials. While modeled after Chinese system, they played much more prominent roles in Joseon government than their Chinese counterparts. In their role as organ of press, they did not have actual authority to decide or implement policies, but had influential voice in the ensuing debate. \nThe officials who served in these offices tended to be younger and of lower rank compared to other offices but had strong academic reputation and enjoyed special privileges and great prestige (For instance, censors were permitted to drink during working hours because of their function of criticizing the king). To be appointed, they went through more thorough review of character and family background. Three Offices provided the fastest route of promotion to high posts and was almost a requirement to becoming a State Councillor.\n:*Office of Inspector General (Saheonbu\u00b7\uc0ac\ud5cc\ubd80) - It monitored government administration and officials at each level in both central and local governments for corruption, malfeasance, or inefficiency. It was also in charge of advancing public morals and Confucian customs and redressing grievances of the populace. It was headed by Inspector General (Daesaheon\u00b7\ub300\uc0ac\ud5cc), a position of 2nd junior rank, who oversaw 30 largely independent officials.\n:*Office of Censors (Saganwon\u00b7\uc0ac\uac04\uc6d0) - Its chief function was to remonstrate with the king if there was wrong or improper action or policy. Important decrees of the king were first reviewed by censors, who could ask to withdraw them if judged improper. It also issued opinions about the general state of affairs. It was composed of five officials, led by Chief Censor (Daesagan\u00b7\ub300\uc0ac\uac04), of 3rd senior rank.\nWhile the primary focus for Office of Inspector General is the government officials and Office of Censors is focused on the king, two offices often performed each other's functions, and there was much overlap. Together they were called \"Yangsa,\" (\uc591\uc0ac) which literally means \"Both Offices,\" and often worked jointly especially when they sought to reverse the king's decision.\n:*Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan\u00b7\ud64d\ubb38\uad00 \u5f18\u6587\u9928) - It oversaw the royal library and served as research institute to study Confucian philosophy and answer the king's questions. Its officials took part in the daily lessons called ''gyeongyeon'' (\uacbd\uc5f0), in which they discussed history and Confucian philosophy with the king. Since these discussions often led to commentary on current political issues, its officials had significant influence as advisors. It was headed by Chief Scholar (Daejehak\u00b7\ub300\uc81c\ud559), a part-time post of 2nd senior rank that served concurrently in another high post (such as in State Council), and Deputy Chief Scholar (Bujehak\u00b7\ubd80\uc81c\ud559), a full-time post of 3rd senior rank that actually ran the office. There was great prestige attached to being Chief Scholar in this deeply Confucian society. (The office was established to replace [[Hall of Worthies]] (Jiphyeonjeon\u00b7\uc9d1\ud604\uc804) after the latter was abolished by [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]] in the aftermath of [[Six martyred ministers]].)\n\n====Other offices====\nThe major offices include the following:\n*Royal Secretariat (Seungjeongwon, \uc2b9\uc815\uc6d0) served as a liaison between the king and Six Ministries. There were six royal secretaries (\uc2b9\uc9c0), one for each ministry, and all were of 3rd senior rank. Their primary role was to pass down royal decree to the ministries and submit petitions from the officials and the populace to the king, but they also advised the king and served in other key positions close to the king. In particular Chief Royal Secretary (\ub3c4\uc2b9\uc9c0), a liaison to Ministry of Personnel, served the king in the closest proximity of all government official and often enjoyed great power that was derived from the king's favor. Hong Guk-yeong (during [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]]'s reign) and Han Myeong-hwe (during [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]]) are some examples of chief royal secretaries who were the most powerful official of their time.\n*Capital Bureau (Hanseongbu, \ud55c\uc131\ubd80) was in charge of running the capital, ''Hanyang'' or present-day Seoul. It was led by ''Panyoon'' (\ud310\uc724), of 2nd senior second rank equivalent to today's mayor of Seoul.\n*Royal Investigation Bureau (Uigeumbu, \uc758\uae08\ubd80) was an investigative and enforcement organ under direct control of the king. It chiefly dealt with treason and other serious cases that concerned the king and royal family and served to arrest, investigate, imprison, and carry out sentences against the suspected offenders, who were often government officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=130510001403866|script-title=ko:\ud55c\uc131\ubd80|publisher=Doosan Encyclopedia|accessdate=2014-03-01|language=Korean}}</ref>\n*Office of Records (Chunchugwan, \ucd98\ucd94\uad00) officials wrote, compiled, and maintained the government and historical records. It was headed by State Councillors, and many posts were held by officials serving in other offices concurrently. There were eight historiographers whose sole function was to record the meetings for history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000868787|script-title=ko:\ucd98\ucd94\uad00|publisher=Doosan Encyclopedia|accessdate=2014-03-01|language=Korean}}</ref>\n*[[Seonggyungwan]] or Royal Academy (\uc131\uade0\uad00) prepared future government officials. Those who passed first two stages of [[gwageo]] examinations (literary exam) were admitted to Seonggyungwan. The class size was usually 200 students, who lived in the residential hall and followed strict routine and school rules. (Tuition, room and board were provided by the government.) It also served as the state shrine for [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] and Korean Confucian sages. The students' opinions on government policies, especially collective statements and demonstrations, could be influential as they represented fresh and uncorrupted consensus of young scholars. The official in charge was Daesaseong (\ub300\uc0ac\uc131), of 3rd senior rank, and 36 other officials including those from other offices were involved in running the academy.\n[[File:Portrait of Park Munsu.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Park Mun-su]] (1691-1756), a secret royal inspector of the Joseon Dynasty]]\n\n===Local government===\nThe officials of high rank were sent from the central government. Sometimes a [[secret royal inspector]] (Amhaeng-eosa\u00b7\uc554\ud589\uc5b4\uc0ac) was appointed by the king to travel incognito and monitor the provincial officials. These undercover inspectors were generally young officials of lower rank but were invested with the royal authority to dismiss corrupt officials.\n* Provinces (Do\u00b7\ub3c4 \u9053) - There were eight provinces, each of which was governed by Governor (Gwanchalsa\u00b7\uad00\ucc30\uc0ac \u89c0\u5bdf\u4f7f), a position of 2nd junior rank.\n* Bu(\ubd80) - administrative offices in charge of major cities in provinces. Each bu was led by Buyoon (\ubd80\uc724), which was equivalent to Governor in rank.\n* Mok (\ubaa9 \u7267) - There were twenty moks, which governed large counties named 'ju'(\uc8fc \u5dde). They were run by Moksa (\ubaa9\uc0ac \u7267\u4f7f), of 3rd senior rank.\n* County (Gun\u00b7\uad70 \u90e1) - There were eighty counties in Joseon, each governed by Gunsu (\uad70\uc218 \u90e1\u5b88), a 4th junior rank.\n* Hyeon (\ud604 \u7e23) - Large hyeons were governed by Hyeongryeong (\ud604\ub839 \u7e23\u4ee4) of 5th junior rank while smaller hyeons were governed by Hyeonggam (\ud604\uac10 \u7e23\u76e3) of 6th junior rank.\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main|Eight Provinces of Korea}}\n\nDuring most of the Joseon Dynasty, Korea was divided into [[Eight Provinces of Korea|eight provinces]] (do; \ub3c4; \u9053). The eight provinces' boundaries remained unchanged for almost five centuries from 1413 to 1895, and formed a geographic paradigm that is still reflected today in the Korean Peninsula's administrative divisions, dialects, and regional distinctions. The names of all eight provinces are still preserved today, in one form or another.\n\n===Military===\n{{expand section|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Foreign affairs ==\n{{main|Joseon diplomacy}}\nAfter establishing new dynasty, Yi requested the new nation to enter the Imperial tributary system under the Ming Dynasty in order to establish economic relations.

By the end of the 18th century, the yangban had acquired most of the traits of a hereditary nobility except that the status was based on a unique mixture of family position, [[gwageo]] examinations for Confucian learning, and a civil service system. The family of a yangban who did not succeed to become a government official for the third generation lost their yangban status and became commoners. For most part, the only way to become a government official was to pass a series of gwageo exams (One had to pass \"lesser gwageo\" exam (\uc18c\uacfc) in both of two stages to qualify for greater gwageo exam, which again one had to pass in both of two stages to become a government official.) The yangban and the king, in an uneasy balance, controlled the central government and military institutions. The proportion of yangban may have reached as high as 30% by 1800, due to the later practices of transaction of yangban status to peasants, although there was considerable local variation.<ref>Oh SC (2006), ''Economic growth in P'yongan Province and the development of Pyongyang in the Late Choson Period''.

A portrait painted by [[Yi Jaegwan]] (1783-1837)]]\n\nIn Joseon Dynasty, jeogori of women's [[hanbok]] became gradually tightened and shortened. In the 16th century, jeogori was baggy and reached below the waist, but by the end of Joseon Dynasty in the 19th century, jeogori was shortened to the point that it did not cover the breasts, so another piece of cloth (''heoritti'') was used to cover them. At the end of the 19th century, [[Daewon-gun]] introduced [[Magoja]], a [[Manchu]]-style jacket, to Korea, which is often worn with hanbok to this day.\n\nChima was full-skirted and jeogori was short and tight in the late Joseon period. Fullness in the skirt was emphasized round the hips. Many undergarments were worn underneath chima such as darisokgot, soksokgot, dansokgot, and gojengi to achieve a desired silhouette. Because jeogori was so short it became natural to expose heoritti or ''heorimari'' which functioned like a corset. The white linen cloth exposed under jeogori in the picture is heoritti.\n\nThe upper classes wore hanbok of closely woven [[ramie]] cloth or other high-grade lightweight materials in warm weather and of plain and patterned silks the rest of the year. Commoners were restricted by law as well as resources to cotton at best. The upper classes wore a variety of colors, though bright colors were generally worn by children and girls and subdued colors by middle-aged men and women. Commoners were restricted by law to everyday clothes of white, but for special occasions they wore dull shades of pale pink, light green, gray, and charcoal. Formally, when Korean men went outdoors, they were required to wear overcoats known as ''durumagi'' which reach the knees.\n\n=== Art ===\n{{See also|Joseon white porcelain}}\n\n[[File:\uc11c\ubb38\ubcf4 \uc0b0\uc218\ub3c4(\u5c71\u6c34\u5716) 15\uc138\uae30.jpg|thumb|Early Joseon landscape painting by Seo Munbo in the late 15th century]]\n\nThe Mid-Joseon dynasty painting styles moved towards increased [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]]. A national painting style of landscapes called \"true view\" began - moving from the traditional Chinese style of idealized general landscapes to particular locations exactly rendered. While not photographic, the style was academic enough to become established and supported as a standardized style in Korean painting. At this time China ceased to have pre-eminent influence, Korean art took its own course, and became increasingly distinctive to the traditional Chinese painting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minbaek.kr/Contents/Item/E0052156|title=\uc870\uc120\uc608\uc220(\u671d\u9bae\u85dd\u8853) - \ud55c\uad6d\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc\uc0ac\uc804|website=www.minbaek.kr|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\ubc31\uc790 \uccad\ud654\ub9e4\uc8fd\ubb38 \ud56d\uc544\ub9ac.jpg|thumb|left|15th century.

Examples of ceramics include white porcelain or white porcelain decorated with cobalt, copper red [[underglaze]], blue underglaze and iron underglaze.

Historically overshadowed by the popularity of [[celadon]], it was not until the 15th and 16th centuries that white porcelain was recognized for its own artistic value. Among the most prized of Korean ceramics are large white jars. Their shape is symbolic of the moon and their color is associated with the ideals of purity and modesty of [[Confucianism]]. During this period, the bureau that oversaw the meals and court banquets of the royal family strictly controlled the production of white porcelain.<ref name=\"BMA\"/>\n\n[[File:Joseon white porcelain jar.jpg|thumb|White porcelain jar, 18th century, Joseon Korea]]\n[[Blue and white porcelain]] artifacts decorating white porcelain with paintings and designs in [[underglaze]] by using natural [[cobalt]] pigment are another example of popular wares of the Joseon period. Many of these items were created by court painters employed by the royal family. During this period, the popular style of landscape paintings is mirrored in the decoration of ceramics.<ref name=\"BMA\"/> Initially developed by the Chinese at the [[Jingdezhen ware|Jingdezhen kilns]] in the mid-14th century, Joseon began to produce this type of porcelain from the 15th century under Chinese influence. The first cobalt imported from China was used by Korean artists. In 1463 when sources of cobalt were discovered in [[Korea]], artists and their buyers found the material was inferior in quality and preferred the more expensive imported cobalt. Korean porcelain with imported cobalt decoration contradict the emphasis of an orderly, frugal and moderate life in [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name=\"BMA\"/>\n\nStrikingly different from cobalt, porcelain items with a copper-red [[underglaze]] are the most difficult to successfully craft. During production, these items require great skill and attention or will turn gray during the process of firing. While the birthplace of ceramics with copper red underglaze is widely disputed, these items originated during 12th century in [[Korea]] and became increasingly popular during the second half of the Joseon period. Some experts have pointed to the kilns of Bunwon-ri in [[Gwangju, Gyeonggi]], a city that played a significant role in the production of ceramics during the Joseon period, as a possible birthplace.<ref name=\"BMA\"/>\n\nPorcelain was also decorated with iron.

However Buddhism actually was a part of the Joseon dynasty. When studying literary exchanges between Confucian scholar officials, and Buddhist it is showing that Buddhism was not cast out. There literary exchanges show a middle ground of both philosophies. \"scholar-officials - Some who in public castigated Buddhism as a heresy and deluded tradition, in private visited temples and associated closely with monks.\" This shows that while in public some scholars shamed Buddhism their exchanges with Buddhists show that in the very least it was not cast outside of their dynasty.\n\nOne example of this is a famous Joseon scholar official {{interlanguage link|Pak Sedang|ko|\ubc15\uc138\ub2f9}} (\ubc15\uc138\ub2f9, \u6734\u4e16\u5802, 1629\u20131703). He argues against Buddhism with the following \"People say that [[Han Yu]] and [[Ouyang Xiu]] have harshly criticized Buddhism and therefore have only discussed what is aberrant and have not fully investigated what is profound. People say, their understanding is lacking and they have not fully examined it [its profoundness]. I, myself, don\u2019t think that is the case\u2026 The heresies under heaven, they are also rather foul. Among them, Buddhism is the worst.

The first copy of ''sijo'' is of the 'Twelve Songs of ''Dosan''<nowiki/>' by ''Yi Hwang'' written in 1565, which were written 100 years after the proclamation of [[Hangul]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rutt|first=Richard|title=The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=157}}</ref> Additionally, the first anthology of ''sijo'' was compiled by ''Kim Cheontaek'' in 1728<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rutt|first=Richard|title=The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=158}}</ref>; before the anthology few ''sijo'' were written.\n\n''Kim Cheontaek''<nowiki/>'s anthology represents a change in the authorship of ''sijo''.\u2002At first, ''sijo'' were primarily composed by the [[Yangban|''yangban'']] aristocracy and entertainers of the ''[[Kisaeng]]'' class.\u2002However, by the mid-seventeenth century, the [[Chungin|''jungin'']] or \u201cprofessional class\u201d were composing ''sijo'' as well.\u2002This also coincided with a new form of ''sijo'' called \u201cnarrative ''sijo''\u201d (Hangul: \uc0ac\uc124\uc2dc\uc870/Hanja: \u8fad\u8aaa\u6642\u8abf), in which the first two lines were greatly lengthened.\u2002<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kim|first=Hy\u016dnggyu|title=Understanding Korean Literature|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}</ref>This expansion is likely a development from the so-called \u201cirregular ''sijo''\u201d (Hangul: \uc5c7\uc2dc\uc870/Hanja: \u65d5\u6642\u8abf), in which there was a minor lengthening of one of the first two lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naver.com|title=Naver|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\u2002While there are very few remaining irregular ''sijo'', and the form has not been revived, there is a sizable body of narrative ''sijo'' and the form continues to evolve.\n\n''[[Pansori|P'ansori]]''  (Hangul: \ud310\uc18c\ub9ac) is another musical form that combines singing and prose to portray a story. Its development likely originates from shaman rituals and the songs within the [[Jeolla Province|''Jeolla'' Province]].\u2002It became a full-fledged musical form by the middle of the eighteenth century, and not long thereafter the yangban aristocracy also became interested in it.\u2002Originally there was a set of twelve stories that were sung, but only five were written down, and hence those five are the only ones sung today.\u2002Having been developed by commoners, ''p'ansori'' usually reflected their attitudes and aspirations, but by becoming popular with the ''yangban'', ''p'ansori'' shifted somewhat toward ''yangban'' sensibilities and restrictions.\u2002''P'ansori'' had a strong influence of the writing of the time, both because of the ''p'ansori'' novel (each based on one of the twelve stories) and by increasing the realism of the classical novel.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{See also|History of science and technology in Korea}}\n[[File:Korean celestial globe.jpg|thumb|Korean [[celestial globe]] first made by the scientist [[Jang Yeong-sil]] during the reign of [[King Sejong]]]]\n\n=== 15th century ===\nThe Joseon Dynasty under the reign of [[Sejong the Great]] was Korea's greatest period of scientific advancement. Under Sejong's new policy, [[Cheonmin]] (low-status) people such as [[Jang Yeong-sil]] were allowed to work for the government. At a young age, Jang displayed talent as an inventor and engineer, creating machines to facilitate agricultural work. These included supervising the building of aqueducts and canals. Jang eventually was allowed to live at the royal palace, where he led a group of scientists to work on advancing Korea's science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSome of his inventions were an automated (self-striking) [[water clock]] (the Jagyeokru) which worked by activating motions of wooden figures to indicate time visually (invented in 1434 by Jang), a subsequent more complicated water-clock with additional astronomical devices, and an improved model of the previous metal movable printing type created in the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. The new model was of even higher quality and was twice as fast. Other inventions were the [[sight glass]], and the [[udometer]].\n\nThe highpoint of Korean astronomy was during the Joseon period, where men such as Jang created devices such as celestial globes which indicated the positions of the sun, moon, and the stars.<ref>{{cite book | author=\ubc31\uc11d\uae30 | title=\uc6c5\uc9c4\uc704\uc778\uc804\uae30 #11 \uc7a5\uc601\uc2e4 | publisher=\uc6c5\uc9c4\ucd9c\ud310\uc0ac | year=1987 | page=56}}</ref> Later celestial globes (Gyupyo, \uaddc\ud45c) were attuned to the seasonal variations.\n\nThe apex of astronomical and calendarial advances under [[King Sejong]] was the [[Chiljeongsan]], which compiled computations of the courses of the seven heavenly objects (five visible planets, the sun, and moon),\ndeveloped in 1442.

The map was created in the second year of the reign of [[Taejong of Joseon]]. The map was made by combining Chinese, Korean and Japanese maps.\n\n=== 16th\u201319th century ===\nThe scientific and technological advance in the late Joseon Dynasty was less progressed than the early Joseon period.\n\n16th-century court physician, [[Heo Jun]] wrote a number of medical texts, his most significant achievement being [[Dongeui Bogam]], which is often noted as the defining text of [[Traditional Korean medicine]]. The work spread to [[China]] and [[Japan]], where it is still regarded as one of the classics of [[Oriental medicine]] today.\n\nThe first soft [[ballistic vest]], [[Myunjebaegab]], was invented in Joseon [[Korea]] in the 1860s shortly after the [[French campaign against Korea (1866)]]. [[Heungseon Daewongun]] ordered development of bullet-proof armor because of increasing threats from Western armies. [[Kim Gi-du]] and [[Gang Yun]] found that [[cotton]] could protect against bullets if thick enough, and devised bullet-proof vests made of 30 layers of cotton. The vests were used in battle during the [[United States expedition to Korea]] (1871), when the US Navy attacked [[Ganghwa Island]] in 1871. The US Army captured one of the vests and took it to the US, where it was stored at the [[Smithsonian Museum]] until 2007. The vest has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Commerce ===\nDuring the Goryeo Dynasty, Korea had a healthy trade relationship with the Japanese, Chinese, and Manchurians. An example of prosperous, international trade port is [[Pyongnam]]. Koreans offered [[brocades]], jewelries, [[ginseng]], [[silk]], and [[porcelain]], renowned famous worldwide. But, during the Joseon Dynasty, Confucianism was adopted as the national philosophy, and, in process of eliminating certain [[Buddhist]] beliefs, [[Korean pottery and porcelain#Goryeo Dynasty|Goryeo Cheongja]] porcelains were replaced by white [[Baekja]], which lost favour of the Chinese. Also, commerce became more restricted during this time in order to promote agriculture. Because silver was used as currency in China, it played an important role in Korea-China trade. \n<!--===Agriculture===\n===Coinage===\n===Manufactures=== \n===Taxation===\n===Land systems===\n===Sprouts of capitalism===\n==Foreign relations==-->\n\n==Titles and styles during Joseon Kingdom==\n{{main|Styles and titles in the Joseon dynasty}}\nTitles and styles used inside the royal family were stratified along the generations and relative to the current King.\n\n== House of Yi ==\n{{Main|House of Yi}}\n{{see also|House of Yi#House of Yi family tree|label 1=The family tree of Joseon kings}}\n[[File:Fuuzokugahou-Myeongseong.gif|thumb|Japanese illustration of [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and Queen Min receiving [[Inoue Kaoru]]]]\n[[File:Choseon Imperial family.jpg|thumb|This compilation photo, taken about 1915, shows the following royal family members, from left: [[Prince Imperial Ui|Prince Ui (''Ui chinwang'' \uc758\uce5c\uc655)]], the 6th son of Gojong; [[Emperor Sunjong of the Korean Empire|Sunjong]], the 2nd son and the last monarch of Joseon; [[Crown Prince Euimin|Prince Yeong (''Yeong chinwang'' \uc601\uce5c\uc655)]], the 7th son; [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]], the former King; [[Empress Sunjeong of the Korean Empire|Queen Yoon (''Yoon daebi'')]], Queen Consort of Sunjong; Deogindang Gimbi, wife of Prince Ui; and [[Kenichi Momoyama|Yi Geon]], the eldest son of Prince Ui.

Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day [[Seoul]]. The kingdom's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of [[Amnok River|Amnok]] and [[Tumen River|Tuman]] through the subjugation of the [[Jurchens]]. Joseon was the last dynasty of Korea and its longest-ruling [[Confucian]] dynasty.\n\nDuring its reign, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society. [[Neo-Confucianism]] was installed as the new dynasty's state ideology. [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]] was accordingly discouraged and occasionally faced persecutions by the dynasty. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. However, the dynasty was severely weakened when the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s]] and the [[first Manchu invasion of Korea|first]] and [[Qing invasion of Joseon|second Manchu invasions]] in 1627 and 1636\u20131637 nearly overran the [[Korean Peninsula]], leading to an increasingly harsh isolationist policy, for which the country became known as the \"[[hermit kingdom]]\" in [[Western literature]]. After the end of invasions from [[Manchuria]], Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace, prosperity, cultural, and technological development.\n\nHowever, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home, the Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Joseon period has left a substantial legacy to modern Korea; much of modern [[Korean culture]], etiquette, norms, and societal attitudes towards current issues, and [[Korean language|the modern Korean language]] and [[Korean dialects|its dialects]], derive from the culture and traditions of Joseon.\n\n== History ==\n{{History of Korea}}\n{{Main|History of the Joseon dynasty}}\n\n=== Early Joseon period ===\n[[File:King Taejo Yi 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]]'s portrait]]\n\n==== Founding ====\nBy the late 14th century, the nearly 500-year-old [[Goryeo]] established in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and ''de facto'' occupation from the disintegrating [[Mongol Empire]]. Following the emergence of the [[Ming dynasty]], the royal court in Goryeo split into two conflicting factions: the group led by General Yi (supporting the Ming) and the camp led by [[Choe Yeong|General Choe]] (standing by the Yuan).\n\nGoryeo claimed to be the successor of the ancient kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (which was later renamed Goryeo); as such, restoring [[Manchuria]] as part of Korean territory was part of its foreign policy throughout its history. When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388, the 14th year of [[U of Goryeo]], to demand that Goguryeo's former northern territory be handed over to Ming China, General Choe seized the chance to argue for an attack on the [[Liaodong Peninsula]].\n\nYi was chosen to lead the attack; however, he revolted and swept back to Gaegyeong and initiated a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], overthrowing King U in favor of his son, [[Chang of Goryeo]] (1388). He later killed King U and his son after a failed restoration and forcibly placed a royal named Yi on the throne (he became [[Gongyang of Goryeo]]). In 1392, Yi eliminated [[Jeong Mong-ju]], highly respected leader of a group loyal to Goryeo dynasty, and dethroned King Gongyang, exiling him to [[Wonju]], and before he ascended the throne. The Goryeo Dynasty had come to an end after almost 500 years of rule.\n\nIn the beginning of his reign, Yi Seonggye, now ruler of Korea, intended to continue use of the name Goryeo for the country he ruled and simply change the royal line of descent to his own, thus maintaining the fa\u00e7ade of continuing the 500-year-old Goryeo tradition. However, after numerous threats of mutiny from the drastically weakened but still influential Gwonmun nobles, who continued to swear allegiance to the remnants of the Goryeo and now the demoted Wang clan, the consensus in the reformed court was that a new dynastic title was needed to signify the change. In naming the new dynasty, Taejo contemplated two possibilities - \"Hwaryeong\" and \"Joseon\". After much internal deliberation, as well as endorsement by the neighboring Ming dynasty's emperor, Taejo declared the name of the kingdom to be Joseon, a tribute to the ancient Korean state of [[Gojoseon]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Kang|first= Jae-eun|date= 2006|title= The Land of Scholars: Two Thousand Years of Korean Confucianism|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XB4UYXNQK1wC&dq=ming+taizu+joseon|publisher= Homa & Sekey Books|page= 177|access-date= August 7, 2015|isbn= 9781931907309}} \"Yi Seong-gye issued a royal edict to proclaim the name of the new dynasty to \"Joseon\" and issued amnesty to all criminals who opposed the transition in dynasty. The statement by Taizu about \"only the name of Joseon is beautiful and old\" naturally refers to Gija Joseon.\"</ref> He also moved the capital to [[Seoul|Hanyang]] from Kaesong.\n\n==== Strife of princes ====\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-GeunJeongJeon.jpg|thumb|left|The Throne Hall at [[Gyeongbokgung]]]]\n{{Joseon Dynasty monarchs}}\n\nWhen the new dynasty was promulgated and officially brought into existence, Taejo brought up the issue of which son would be his successor. Although Yi Bangwon, Taejo's fifth son by Queen Sineui, had contributed most to assisting his father's rise to power, the prime minister [[Jeong Dojeon]] and [[Nam Eun]] used their influence on King Taejo to name his eighth son (second son of Queen Sindeok) Grand Prince Uian (Yi Bangseok) as crown prince in 1392. This conflict arose largely because Jeong Dojeon, who shaped and laid down ideological, institutional, and legal foundations of the new dynasty more than anyone else, saw Joseon as a kingdom led by ministers appointed by the king while Yi Bangwon wanted to establish the absolute monarchy ruled directly by the king. With Taejo's support, Jeong Dojeon kept limiting the royal family's power by prohibiting political involvement of princes and attempting to abolish their private armies. Both sides were well aware of each other's great animosity and were getting ready to strike first.\n\nAfter the sudden death of Queen Sindeok, while King Taejo was still in mourning for his second wife, Yi Bangwon struck first by raiding the palace and killed Jeong Dojeon and his supporters as well as Queen Sindeok's two sons (his half-brothers) including the crown prince in 1398. This incident became known as the First Strife of Princes.\n\nAghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the crown, and psychologically exhausted from the death of his second wife, King Taejo abdicated and immediately crowned his second son Yi Banggwa as [[Jeongjong of Joseon|King Jeongjong]]. One of King Jeongjong's first acts as monarch was to revert the capital to [[Kaesong]], where he is believed to have been considerably more comfortable, away from the toxic power strife. Yet Yi Bangwon retained real power and was soon in conflict with his disgruntled older brother, Yi Banggan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, the tensions between Yi Bangwon's faction and Yi Banggan's camp escalated into an all-out conflict that came to be known as the Second Strife of Princes. In the aftermath of the struggle, the defeated Yi Banggan was exiled to [[Tosan County|Dosan]] while his supporters were executed. Thoroughly intimidated, King Jeongjong immediately invested Yi Bangwon as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Bangwon assumed the throne of Joseon at long last as [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]], third king of Joseon.\n\n====Consolidation of royal power====\nIn the beginning of Taejong's reign, the Grand King Former, Taejo, refused to relinquish the royal seal that signified the legitimacy of any king's rule. Taejong began to initiate policies he believed would prove his qualification to rule. One of his first acts as king was to abolish the privilege enjoyed by the upper echelons of government and the aristocracy to maintain private armies. His revoking of such rights to field independent forces effectively severed their ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of men employed in the national military. Taejong's next act as king was to revise the existing legislation concerning the taxation of land ownership and the recording of state of subjects. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national income increased twofold.\n\nIn 1399, Taejong had played an influential role in scrapping the [[Dopyeong Assembly]], a council of the old government administration that held a monopoly in court power during the waning years of the Goryeo Dynasty, in favor of the [[State Council of Joseon]] ({{Hangul|\uc758\uc815\ubd80}} {{Hanja|\u8b70\u653f\u5e9c}}), a new branch of central administration that revolved around the king and his edicts. After passing the subject documentation and taxation legislation, King Taejong issued a new decree in which all decisions passed by the State Council could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom of court ministers and advisors making decisions through debate and negotiations amongst themselves, and thus brought the royal power to new heights.\n\nShortly thereafter, Taejong installed an office, known as the [[Sinmun Office]], to hear cases in which aggrieved subjects felt that they had been exploited or treated unjustly by government officials or [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s. However, Taejong kept Jeong Dojeon's reforms intact for most part. In addition, Taejong executed or exiled many of his supporters who helped him ascend on the throne in order to strengthen the royal authority. To limit influence of in-laws, he also killed all four of his Queen's brothers and his son [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]]'s father-in-law. Taejong remains a controversial figure who killed many of his rivals and relatives to gain power and yet ruled effectively to improve the populace's lives, strengthen national defense, and lay down a solid foundation for his successor Sejong's rule.\n\n====Sejong the Great====\n[[File:\uc601\uc758\uc815\ud558\uc5f0\ubd80\ubd80\uc601\uc8153.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Ha Yeon]] who served as [[Yeonguijeong]] during the [[Sejong of Joseon|King Sejong]]'s reign.]]\n[[File:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|right|A page from the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Eonhae'', a partial translation of ''[[Hunminjeongeum]]'', the original promulgation of the Korean alphabet]]\n\nIn August 1418, following Taejong's abdication two months earlier, [[Sejong the Great]] ascended the throne.

In 1443, The [[Treaty of Gyehae]] was signed in which the ''daimy\u014d'' of Tsushima was granted rights to conduct trade with Korea in fifty ships per year in exchange for sending tribute to Korea and aiding to stop any Waegu coastal pirate raids on Korean ports.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Korea | last= Richard Rutt.| publisher= Routledge/Curzon| date= September 1999|isbn=978-0-7007-0464-4|url= https://books.google.com/?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&pg=PA255&dq=kyehae+treaty&q=kyehae%20treaty|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title= The Cambridge history of Japan |volume=3 |trans-title= Medieval Japan |last= John W.

In 1433, Sejong sent [[Kim Jong-seo (general)|Kim Jong-seo]], a government official, north to fend off the Jurchens.

After [[Six martyred ministers|six ministers loyal to Danjong]] attempted to assassinate Sejo to return Danjong to the throne, Sejo executed the six ministers and also killed Danjong in his place of exile.\n\nKing Sejo enabled the government to determine exact population numbers and to mobilize troops effectively. He also revised the land ordinance to improve the national economy and encouraged publication of books. Most importantly, he compiled the Grand Code for State Administration, which became the cornerstone of dynastic administration and provided the first form of constitutional law in a written form in Korea.\n\nHowever, he undermined much foundation of the many systems including the Jiphyeonjeon which his predecessors King Sejong and Munjong had carefully laid down, cutting down on everything he deemed unworthy of the effort and thus caused countless complications in the long run. Much of his own adjustments were done for his own power, not regarding the consequences and problems that would occur. Furthermore, the relentless favoritism which he showed towards the ministers who aided him in the taking of the throne led to much corruption in the higher echelon of the political field.\n\n====Institutional arrangements and Prosper culture====\nSejo's weak son [[Yejong of Joseon|Yejong]] succeeded him as the eighth king, but died two years later in 1469. Yejong's nephew [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] ascended the throne. His reign was marked by the prosperity and growth of the national economy and the rise of neo-Confucian scholars called [[sarim]] who were encouraged by Seongjong to enter court politics. He established Hongmungwan ({{hanja|\u5f18\u6587\u9928}}), the royal library and advisory council composed of Confucian scholars, with whom he discussed philosophy and government policies. He ushered in a cultural golden age that rivaled Sejong's reign by publishing numerous books on geography, ethics, and various other fields.\n\nHe also sent several military campaigns against the Jurchens on the northern border in 1491, like many of his predecessors. The campaign, led by General [[Heo Jong]], was successful, and the defeated Jurchens, led by the Udige clan ({{hanja|\u5140\u72c4\u54c8}}), retreated to the north of the [[Yalu River]]. King Seongjong was succeeded by his son, [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsangun]], in 1494.\n\n====Literati purges====\n{{Main|Korean literati purges}}\n[[File:Cho Kwang-jo in 1750.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the neo-Confucian scholar, [[Jo Gwang-jo]] \uc870\uad11\uc870 (1482\u20131519)]]\n\n[[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsangun]] is often considered the worst tyrant of the Joseon, whose reign was marked by [[Korean literati purges]] between 1498 and 1506. His behavior became erratic after he learned that his biological mother was not Queen Junghyeon but the [[deposed Queen Lady Yun]], who was forced to drink poison after poisoning one of Seongjong's concubines out of jealousy and leaving a scratch mark on Seongjong's face. When he was shown a piece of clothing that was allegedly stained with his mother's blood vomited after drinking poison, he beat to death two of Seongjong's concubines who had accused Consort Yun and he pushed Grand Queen Insu, who died afterward. He executed government officials who supported Consort Yun's death along with their families. He also executed [[sarim]] scholars for writing phrases critical of Sejo's usurpation of the throne.\n\nYeonsangun also seized a thousand women from the provinces to serve as palace entertainers and appropriated the [[Sungkyunkwan]] as a personal pleasure ground. He abolished the Office of Censors, whose function was to criticize inappropriate actions and policies of the king, and Hongmungwan. He banned the use of hangul when the common people wrote with it on posters criticizing the king. After twelve years of misrule, he was finally deposed in a coup that placed his half-brother [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]] on the throne in 1506.\n\nJungjong was a fundamentally weak king because of the circumstances that placed him on the throne, but his reign also saw a period of significant reforms led by his minister [[Jo Gwang-jo]], the charismatic leader of sarim. He established a local self-government system called [[hyangyak]] to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit among the people, sought to reduce the gap between the rich and poor with a land reform that would distribute land to farmers more equally and limit the amount of land and number of slaves that one could own, promulgated widely among the populace Confucian writings with vernacular translations, and sought to trim the size of government by reducing the number of bureaucrats. According to the ''[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty]]'', it was said that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because as Inspector General, he applied law strictly.\n\nThese radical reforms were very popular with the populace but were fiercely opposed by the conservative officials who helped to put Jungjong on the throne. They plotted to cause Jungjong to doubt Jo's loyalty. Jo Gwangjo was executed, and most of his reform measures died with him in the resulting [[Korean literati purges#Third Literati Purge of 1519|Third Literati Purge of 1519]]. For nearly 50 years afterward, the court politics was marred by bloody and chaotic struggles between factions backing rival consorts and princes. In-laws of the royal family wielded great power and contributed to much corruption in that era.\n\n===Middle Joseon period===\n[[File:\uc815\ucca0.jpg|thumb|[[Jeong Cheol]] \uc815\ucca0 (1536-1593), head of the Western faction]]\n\nThe middle period of Joseon dynasty was marked by a series of intense and bloody power struggles between political factions that weakened the country and large-scale invasions by Japan and Manchu that nearly toppled the dynasty.\n\n====Factional struggle====\n{{Main|Political factions in Joseon dynasty}}\n\nThe [[Sarim]] faction had suffered a series of political defeats during the reigns of Yeonsangun, Jungjong, and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]], but it gained control of the government during the reign of [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]. It soon split into opposing factions known as the [[Easterners]] and the [[Westerners (Korean political faction)|Westerners]]. Within decades the Easterners themselves divided into the [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southerners]] and the [[Northerners (Korean political faction)|Northerners]]; in the seventeenth century the Westerners as well permanently split into the [[Noron (Korean political faction)|Noron]] and the [[Soron (Korean political faction)|Soron]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrey |first1=Patricia |last2=Walthall |first2=Ann |date= 2013 |title= East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Volume II: From 1600 |url=  https://books.google.com/?id=5pLGIcp4PMgC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq=patriarchs+joseon+faction#v=onepage&q=patriarchs%20joseon%20faction&f=false |publisher= Cengage Learning|page= 255 |isbn= 978-1133606499|access-date= July 15, 2015}}</ref> The alternations in power among these factions were often accompanied by charges of treason and bloody purges, initiating a cycle of revenge with each change of regime.\n\nOne example is the [[1589 rebellion of Jeong Yeo-rip]], one of the bloodiest political purges of Joseon. Jeong Yeo-rip, an Easterner, had formed a society with group of supporters that also received military training to fight against [[Wokou|Waegu]]. There is still a dispute about the nature and purpose of his group, which reflected desire for classless society and spread throughout [[Honam]]. He was subsequently accused of conspiracy to start a rebellion. [[Jeong Cheol]], head of the Western faction, was in charge of investigating the case and used this event to effect widespread purge of Easterners who had slightest connection with Jeong Yeo-rip. Eventually 1000 Easterners were killed or exiled in the aftermath.\n\n====Early Japanese invasions====\n{{Main|Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)}}\n[[File:Turtle boat.jpg|thumb|A [[turtle ship]].

The only purpose for the Joseon navy was to secure the maritime trade against the [[wokou]]. The navy repelled pirates using an advanced form of gunpowder technologies including cannons and [[fire arrows]] in form of [[singijeon]] deployed by [[hwacha]].\n\nDuring the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)|Japanese invasions in the 1590s]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], plotting the conquest of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] with [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] guns, invaded Korea with his ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and their troops, intending to use Korea as a stepping stone. Factional division in the Joseon court, inability to assess Japanese military capability, and failed attempts at diplomacy led to poor preparation on Joseon's part. The use of European firearms by the Japanese left most of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula occupied within months, with both [[Hanseong]] (present-day [[Seoul]]) and [[Pyongyang]] captured.\n\nHowever, the invasion was slowed when Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] destroyed the Japanese invasion fleet. The guerrilla resistance that eventually formed also helped. Local resistance slowed down the Japanese advance and decisive naval victories by Admiral Yi left control over sea routes in Korean hands, severely hampering Japanese supply lines. Furthermore, Ming China intervened on the side of the Koreans, sending a large force in 1593 which pushed back the Japanese together with the Koreans.\n\nDuring the war, Koreans developed powerful firearms and the [[turtle ship]]s. The Joseon and Ming forces defeated the Japanese at a deep price. Following the war, relations between Korea and Japan were completely suspended until 1609.\n\n====Manchu invasions====\n{{see also|First Manchu invasion of Korea|Second Manchu invasion of Korea}}\n[[File:Jurchen warriors.jpg|thumb|left|A Korean painting depicting two Jurchen warriors and their horses]]\n\nAfter the Japanese invasions, the Korean Peninsula was devastated.

On such occasions, Nurhaci required help from [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] (r.1608&ndash;1623), putting the Korean state in a difficult position because the Ming court was also requesting assistance.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}.</ref> Gwanghaegun tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting Ming China, which had saved Joseon during Hideyoshi's invasions.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\"/>\n\nIn 1623, Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon]] (r. 1623&ndash;1649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters.

It aimed to rebuild Joseon society after it had been devastated by the two invasions. Under the leadership of [[Kim Yuk]], the chief minister of [[Hyeonjong of Joseon|King Hyeonjong]], the implementation of reforms proved highly advantageous both to state revenues and to the lot of the peasants.\n\nFactional conflict grew particularly intense under the reigns of the kings [[Sukjong of Joseon|Sukjong]] and [[Gyeongjong of Joseon|Gyeongjong]], with major rapid reversals of the ruling faction, known as *hwanguk* (\u63db\u5c40; literally ''change in the state of affairs''), being commonplace. As a response, the next kings, [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]], generally pursued the ''Tangpyeongchaek'' - a policy of maintaining balance and equality between the factions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title= \ud0d5\ud3c9\ucc45 |encyclopedia= \ud55c\uad6d\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc774\uc131\ubb34| date   = November 12, 2007| title     = \uc870\uc120\ub2f9\uc7c1\uc0ac 2 \ud0d5\ud3c9\uacfc \uc138\ub3c4\uc815\uce58: \uc219\uc885\uc870~\uace0\uc885\uc870| publisher = \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4\ub0a0 | isbn = 9788989354833}}</ref>\n\nThe two kings led a second renaissance of the Joseon dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Korea|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&pg=PT98#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=23 December 2016|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Beirne|first1=Paul|title=Su-un and His World of Symbols: The Founder of Korea's First Indigenous Religion|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317047490|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OPeCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT38#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=23 December 2016|language=en}}</ref> Yeongjo's grandson, the enlightened King Jeongjo enacted various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing Gyujanggak, a royal library in order to improve the cultural and political position of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to run the nation. King Jeongjo also spearheaded bold social initiatives, opening government positions to those who would previously have been barred because of their social status. King Jeongjo had the support of the many Silhak scholars, who supported his regal power. King Jeongjo's reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture. At that time, the group of Silhak scholars encouraged the individual to reflect on state traditions and lifestyle, initiating the studies of Korea that addressed its history, geography, [[epigraphy]] and language.\n\n====Government by in-law families====\nAfter the death of King Jeongjo, the Joseon faced difficult external and internal problems. Internally, the foundation of national law and order weakened as a result of \"Sedo\" politics (in-law government) by royal in-law family.\n\nYoung [[Sunjo of Joseon|King Sunjo]] succeeded King Jeongjo in 1800. With Jeongjo's death the [[Intransigents (Joseon faction)|Intransigent Patriarch faction]] seized power with the regency of [[Queen Jeongsun|Queen Dowager Jeongsun]], whose family had strong ties to the Intransigents, and initiated a [[Catholic Persecution of 1801|persecution of Catholics]]. But after the retirement and death of the Queen Dowager, the Intransigents were gradually ousted and the Expedient faction, including the Andong Kim family of [[Kim Jo-sun]], the father of the queen, gained power. Gradually the Andong Kims came to dominate the court.<ref>{{cite book| last  = \uc624\uc601\uad50| date   = July 25, 2007| title     = \uc138\ub3c4\uc815\uad8c\uae30 \uc870\uc120\uc0ac\ud68c\uc640 \ub300\uc804\ud68c\ud1b5| publisher = \ud61c\uc548 | isbn = 9788984943131}}</ref>\n\nWith the domination of the Andong Kims, the era of *sedo politics* or in-law rule began. The formidable in-law lineage monopolized the vital positions in government, holding sway over the political scene, and intervening in the succession of the throne. These kings had no monarchic authority and could not rule over the government. The yangban of other families, overwhelmed by the power exercised by the royal in-laws, could not speak out. As the power was concentrated in the hands of the royal in-law lineage, there was disorder in the governing process and corruption became rampant. Large sums were offered in bribes to the powerful lineages to obtain positions with nominally high rank. Even the low-ranking posts were bought and sold. This period, which spanned 60 years, saw the manifestation of both severe poverty among the Korean population and ceaseless rebellions in various parts of the country.\n\nExternally, Joseon became increasingly [[isolationist]]. Its rulers sought to limit contact with foreign countries.\n\n==== End of the dynasty ====\n[[File:\uc774\ud558\uc751 \ucd08\uc0c1.jpg|thumb|[[Heungseon Daewongun]] \ud765\uc120 \ub300\uc6d0\uad70(\uc774\ud558\uc751)]]\n<!--[[File:Flag of Korea 1882.svg|thumb|upright|The Joseon flag from 1882 to 1897]]-->\n\nIn 1863 [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] took the throne. His father, Regent [[Heungseon Daewongun]], ruled for him until Gojong reached adulthood. During the mid-1860s the Regent was the main proponent of isolationism and the instrument of the persecution of native and foreign Catholics, a policy that led directly to the [[French campaign against Korea|French Campaign against Korea]] in 1866. The early years of his rule also witnessed a large effort to restore the dilapidated [[Gyeongbok Palace]], the seat of royal authority. During his reign, the power and authority of the in-law families such as the Andong Kims sharply declined. In order to get rid of the Andong Kim and Pungyang Cho families, he promoted persons without making references to political party or family affiliations, and in order to reduce the burdens of the people and solidify the basis of the nation's economy, he reformed the tax system. [[United States expedition to Korea|In 1871, U.S. and Korean forces clashed]] in a U.S. attempt at \"gunboat diplomacy\" following on the [[General Sherman incident]] of 1866.\n\nIn 1873, King Gojong announced his assumption of royal rule. With the subsequent retirement of Heungseon Daewongun, the future Queen Min (later called [[Empress Myeongseong]]) became a power in the court, placing her family in high court positions.\n\nJapan, after the [[Meiji Restoration]], acquired Western military technology, and forced Joseon to sign the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]] in 1876, opening three ports to trade and granting the Japanese extraterritoriality. [[Port Hamilton Incident|Port Hamilton was occupied]] by the British Navy in 1885.\n\n[[File:Portrait_of_Gojong_01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]]]]\nMany Koreans despised Japanese and foreign influences over their land and the corrupt oppressive rule of the Joseon Dynasty. In 1881, the ''[[Byeolgigun]]'', a modern elite military unit, was formed with Japanese trainers. The salaries of the other soldiers were held back and in 1882 [[Imo incident|rioting soldiers]] attacked the Japanese officers and even forced the queen to take refuge in the countryside. In 1894, the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] saw farmers rise up in a mass rebellion, with peasant leader [[Jeon Bong-jun]] defeating the forces of local ruler Jo Byong-gap at the battle of [[Jeongeup|Go-bu]] on January 11, 1894; after the battle, Jo's properties were handed out to the peasants. By May, the peasant army had reached [[Jeonju]], and the Joseon government asked the [[Qing dynasty]] government for assistance in ending the revolt. The Qing sent 3,000 troops and the rebels negotiated a truce, but the Japanese considered the Qing presence a threat and sent in 8,000 troops of their own, seizing the Royal Palace in Seoul and installing a pro-Japanese government on 8 June 1894. This soon escalated into the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895) between Japan and Qing China, fought largely in Korea. [*The king made a deal with Japan partially out of isolationist views and conservative-misogynistic distrust of the queen's support for open trade policies towards the Western civilizations and China.  He ended up preempting a specific disadvantageous, exclusive negotiation with Japan previous to the Queen's decision, which was later used as a political premise for Japan to wage military action.  Scholars particularly during the Joseon era were touted for expressing allegiance to the king]\n\n[[Empress Myeongseong]] (referred to as \"Queen Min\"<ref name=\"queen min\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/11/10/106073098.pdf Characteristics of Queen of Corea] ''[[The New York Times]]'' November 10, 1895</ref>) had attempted to counter Japanese interference in Korea and was considering turning to the [[Russian Empire]] or to China for support. In 1895, Empress Myeongseong was assassinated by Japanese agents.<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\"/><ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\">{{cite news|url=http://www.donga.com/docs/magazine/shin/2004/11/09/200411090500053/200411090500053_1.html |script-title=ko:\uc77c\ubcf8\uc778 \ud3ed\ub3c4\uac00 \uac00\uc2b4\uc744 \uc138 \ubc88 \uc9d3\ubc1f\uace0 \uc77c\ubcf8\ub3c4\ub85c \ub09c\uc790\ud588\ub2e4 |newspaper=[[Dong-a Ilbo]] |author=Park Jong-hyo (\ubc15\uc885\ud6a8), former professor at [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]] |date= 2002-01-01 |issue= 508 |pages=472 ~ 485|language=Korean}}</ref> The Japanese minister to Korea, [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Viscount]] [[Miura Gor\u014d|Miura]], almost certainly orchestrated the plot against her. A group of Japanese agents<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\"/> entered the [[Gyeongbokgung]] Royal Palace in Seoul, which was under Japanese control,<ref name=\"Dong-a 2002\"/> and Queen Min was killed and her body desecrated in the North wing of the palace.\n\nThe Qing acknowledged defeat in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (17 April 1895), which officially guaranteed Korea's independence from China. It was a step toward Japan gaining regional [[hegemony]] in Korea. The Joseon court, pressured by encroachment from larger powers, felt the need to reinforce national integrity and declared the '''[[Korean Empire]]''', along with the [[Gwangmu Reform]] in 1897. [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] assumed the title of [[Emperor of Korea|Emperor]] in order to assert Korea's independence. In addition, other foreign powers were sought for military technology, especially Russia, to fend off the Japanese. Technically, 1897 marks the end of the Joseon period, as the official name of the empire was changed; however the Joseon Dynasty would still reign, albeit perturbed by Japan and Russia.\n\nIn a complicated series of maneuvers and counter-maneuvers, Japan pushed back the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] in 1905. With the conclusion of the 1904\u20131905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], the way was open for Japan to take control of Korea. After the signing of the [[Eulsa Treaty|Protectorate Treaty]] in 1905, Korea became a [[protectorate]] of Japan. [[Prince]] [[It\u014d Hirobumi|It\u014d]] was the first [[Resident-General of Korea]], although he was assassinated by [[Korean independence activist]] [[An Jung-geun]] in 1909 at the train station at [[Harbin]]. In 1910 the [[Japanese Empire]] finally [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] Korea.\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Joseon Dynasty politics}}\n\nJoseon dynasty was a highly centralized monarchy and neo-Confucian bureaucracy as codified by [[Gyeongguk daejeon]], a sort of Joseon constitution.\n\n===King===\n{{see also|List of Joseon monarchs|House of Yi#House of Yi family tree|#Titles_and_styles_during_Joseon_Kingdom|label 2=Joseon kings family tree|label 3= Royal titles and styles during the Joseon Period}}\n[[File:Seoul Gyeongbokgung Throne.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Phoenix Throne]] of the king of Joseon in [[Gyeongbokgung]]]]\n[[File:Flag of the king of Joseon.svg|thumb|upright|[[List of Korean flags|Royal standard of the King of Joseon]]]]\nThe king had absolute authority, but his actual power varied with political circumstances. He was bound by tradition, precedents set by earlier kings, [[Gyeongguk daejeon]], and Confucian teachings. The king commanded absolute loyalty from his officials and subjects, but the officials were also expected to persuade the king to the right path if the latter was thought to be mistaken. The natural disasters were thought to be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences. When there was severe drought or a series of disasters, the king often formally sought criticism from both the officials and citizenry, and whatever they said or wrote were protected from prosecution in such cases (although there were few exceptions).\n\nDirect communication between the king and the common people was possible through the ''sangeon'' ({{Korean|hangul=\uc0c1\uc5b8|hanja=\u4e0a\u8a00|labels=no}}) written petition system and the ''gyeokjaeng'' ({{Korean|hangul=\uaca9\uc7c1|hanja=\u64ca\u931a|labels=no}}) oral petition system. Through the ''gyeokjaeng'' oral petition system, commoners could strike a gong or drum in front of the palace or during the king's public processions in order to appeal their grievances or petition to the king directly. This allowed even the illiterate members of Joseon society to make a petition to the king. More than 1,300 ''gyeokjaeng''-related accounts are recorded in the [[Ilseongnok]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ilseongnok: Records of Daily Reflections|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/Korea%20Ilseongnok.pdf|website=Memory of the World Register|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Injae|first1=Lee|last2=Miller|first2=Owen|last3=Jinhoon|first3=Park|last4=Hyun-Hae|first4=Yi|title=Korean History in Maps|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107098466|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46OTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=6 December 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\uc0c1\uc5b8\uaca9\uc7c1|url=http://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?content_id=cp021002840001|website=\ubb38\ud654\ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub2f7\ucef4|publisher=Korea Creative Content Agency|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\nThe government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from first senior rank (\uc8151\ud488, \u6b63\u4e00\u54c1) down to ninth junior rank (\uc8859\ud488, \u5f9e\u4e5d\u54c1) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examination or recommendation. The officials from 1st senior rank to 3rd senior rank wore red robes while those from 3rd junior rank to 6th junior rank wore blue and those below wore green robes.<ref>[[Gyeongguk daejeon]]</ref>\n\nHere a government official refers to one who occupied a type of office that gave its holder a [[yangban]] status - semi-hereditary nobility that was effective for three generations. In order to become such an official, one had to pass a series of [[gwageo]] examinations. There were three kinds of gwageo exams - literary, military, and miscellaneous, among which literary route was the most prestigious. (Many of key posts including all [[#Three Offices|Censorate]] posts were open only to officials who advanced through literary exam.) In case of literary route, there was a series of four tests, all of which one had to pass in order to qualify to become an official. 33 candidates who were chosen in this manner took the final exam before the king for placement. The candidate with the highest score was appointed to a position of 6th junior rank (a jump of six ranks). Two candidates with the next two highest scores were appointed to a position of 7th junior rank. Seven candidates with next highest scores were assigned to 8th junior rank while the remaining 23 candidates were given 9th junior rank, the lowest of 18 ranks.\n\nThe officials of 1st senior rank, 1st junior rank, and 2nd senior rank were addressed with honorific \"dae-gam\" (\ub300\uac10, \u5927\u76e3) while those of 2nd junior rank and 3rd senior rank were addressed with honorific \"[[yeong-gam]]\" (\uc601\uac10, \u4ee4\u76e3).<ref>Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies, \"About Rank of Joseon Officials\"</ref> These red-robed officials, collectively called \"dangsanggwan\" (\ub2f9\uc0c1\uad00, \u5802\u4e0a\u5b98), took part in deciding government policies by attending cabinet meetings. The rest of ranked officials were called \"danghagwan\" (\ub2f9\ud558\uad00, \u5802\u4e0b\u5b98).\n\n===Central government===\n\n====State Council====\n[[File:Joseon-Portrait_of_Cha_Jegong-Geumgwanjobok.jpg|thumb|Portrait of The Chief State Councillor [[Yeongeuijeong|Chae Jegong]] (1720~1799)]]\n\n[[State Council of Joseon|State Council]] (Uijeongbu, \uc758\uc815\ubd80, \u8b70\u653f\u5e9c) was the highest deliberative body, whose power however declined over the course of dynasty. The Chief State Councillor ([[Yeonguijeong]], \uc601\uc758\uc815, \u9818\u8b70\u653f), Left State Councillor ([[Jwauijeong]], \uc88c\uc758\uc815, \u5de6\u8b70\u653f), and Right State Councillor (Uuijeong, \uc6b0\uc758\uc815, \u53f3\u8b70\u653f) were the highest-ranking officials in the government (All three were of 1st senior rank). They were assisted by Left Minister (Jwachanseong, \uc88c\ucc2c\uc131, \u5de6\u8d0a\u6210) and Right Minister (Uichangseong, \uc6b0\ucc2c\uc131, \u53f3\u8d0a\u6210), both of 1st junior rank, and seven lower ranking officials. The power of State Council was inversely proportional to the king's power. There were periods when it directly controlled [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]], the chief executive body of Joseon government, but it primarily served in advisory role under stronger kings. State councillors served in several other positions concurrently.\n\n====Six Ministries====\n[[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] (Yukjo, \uc721\uc870, \u516d\u66f9) make up the chief executive body. Each minister (Panseo, \ud310\uc11c, \u5224\u66f8) was of 2nd senior rank and was assisted by deputy minister (Champan, \ucc38\ud310, \u53c3\u5224), who was of 2nd junior rank. Ministry of Personnel was the most senior office of six ministries. As the influence of State Council waned over time, Minister of Personnel was often de facto head of ministers. Six ministries include in the order of seniority.\n\n:*Ministry of Personnel (Ijo, \uc774\uc870, \u540f\u66f9) - was primarily concerned with appointment of officials\n:*Ministry of Taxation (Hojo, \ud638\uc870, \u6236\u66f9) - taxation, finances, census, agriculture, and land policies\n:*Ministry of Rites (Yejo, \uc608\uc870, \u79ae\u66fa) - rituals, culture, diplomacy, gwageo exam\n:*Ministry of Defence (Byeongjo, \ubcd1\uc870, \u5175\u66fa) - military affairs\n:**Office of Police Bureau ([[Podocheong]], \ud3ec\ub3c4\uccad, \u6355\u76dc\u5ef3) - office for public order\n:*Ministry of Justice (Hyeongjo, \ud615\uc870, \u5211\u66fa) - administration of law, slavery, punishments\n:*Ministry of Commerce (Gongjo, \uacf5\uc870, \u5de5\u66f9) - industry, public works, manufacturing, mining\n\n====Three Offices====\n[[Three Offices]], or ''Samsa'' (\uc0bc\uc0ac), is a collective name for three offices that functioned as major organ of press and provided checks and balance on the king and the officials. While modeled after Chinese system, they played much more prominent roles in Joseon government than their Chinese counterparts. In their role as organ of press, they did not have actual authority to decide or implement policies, but had influential voice in the ensuing debate. \nThe officials who served in these offices tended to be younger and of lower rank compared to other offices but had strong academic reputation and enjoyed special privileges and great prestige (For instance, censors were permitted to drink during working hours because of their function of criticizing the king). To be appointed, they went through more thorough review of character and family background. Three Offices provided the fastest route of promotion to high posts and was almost a requirement to becoming a State Councillor.\n:*Office of Inspector General (Saheonbu\u00b7\uc0ac\ud5cc\ubd80) - It monitored government administration and officials at each level in both central and local governments for corruption, malfeasance, or inefficiency. It was also in charge of advancing public morals and Confucian customs and redressing grievances of the populace. It was headed by Inspector General (Daesaheon\u00b7\ub300\uc0ac\ud5cc), a position of 2nd junior rank, who oversaw 30 largely independent officials.\n:*Office of Censors (Saganwon\u00b7\uc0ac\uac04\uc6d0) - Its chief function was to remonstrate with the king if there was wrong or improper action or policy. Important decrees of the king were first reviewed by censors, who could ask to withdraw them if judged improper. It also issued opinions about the general state of affairs. It was composed of five officials, led by Chief Censor (Daesagan\u00b7\ub300\uc0ac\uac04), of 3rd senior rank.\nWhile the primary focus for Office of Inspector General is the government officials and Office of Censors is focused on the king, two offices often performed each other's functions, and there was much overlap. Together they were called \"Yangsa,\" (\uc591\uc0ac) which literally means \"Both Offices,\" and often worked jointly especially when they sought to reverse the king's decision.\n:*Office of Special Advisors (Hongmungwan\u00b7\ud64d\ubb38\uad00 \u5f18\u6587\u9928) - It oversaw the royal library and served as research institute to study Confucian philosophy and answer the king's questions. Its officials took part in the daily lessons called ''gyeongyeon'' (\uacbd\uc5f0), in which they discussed history and Confucian philosophy with the king. Since these discussions often led to commentary on current political issues, its officials had significant influence as advisors. It was headed by Chief Scholar (Daejehak\u00b7\ub300\uc81c\ud559), a part-time post of 2nd senior rank that served concurrently in another high post (such as in State Council), and Deputy Chief Scholar (Bujehak\u00b7\ubd80\uc81c\ud559), a full-time post of 3rd senior rank that actually ran the office. There was great prestige attached to being Chief Scholar in this deeply Confucian society. (The office was established to replace [[Hall of Worthies]] (Jiphyeonjeon\u00b7\uc9d1\ud604\uc804) after the latter was abolished by [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]] in the aftermath of [[Six martyred ministers]].)\n\n====Other offices====\nThe major offices include the following:\n*Royal Secretariat (Seungjeongwon, \uc2b9\uc815\uc6d0) served as a liaison between the king and Six Ministries. There were six royal secretaries (\uc2b9\uc9c0), one for each ministry, and all were of 3rd senior rank. Their primary role was to pass down royal decree to the ministries and submit petitions from the officials and the populace to the king, but they also advised the king and served in other key positions close to the king. In particular Chief Royal Secretary (\ub3c4\uc2b9\uc9c0), a liaison to Ministry of Personnel, served the king in the closest proximity of all government official and often enjoyed great power that was derived from the king's favor. Hong Guk-yeong (during [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]]'s reign) and Han Myeong-hwe (during [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]]) are some examples of chief royal secretaries who were the most powerful official of their time.\n*Capital Bureau (Hanseongbu, \ud55c\uc131\ubd80) was in charge of running the capital, ''Hanyang'' or present-day Seoul. It was led by ''Panyoon'' (\ud310\uc724), of 2nd senior second rank equivalent to today's mayor of Seoul.\n*Royal Investigation Bureau (Uigeumbu, \uc758\uae08\ubd80) was an investigative and enforcement organ under direct control of the king. It chiefly dealt with treason and other serious cases that concerned the king and royal family and served to arrest, investigate, imprison, and carry out sentences against the suspected offenders, who were often government officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=130510001403866|script-title=ko:\ud55c\uc131\ubd80|publisher=Doosan Encyclopedia|accessdate=2014-03-01|language=Korean}}</ref>\n*Office of Records (Chunchugwan, \ucd98\ucd94\uad00) officials wrote, compiled, and maintained the government and historical records. It was headed by State Councillors, and many posts were held by officials serving in other offices concurrently. There were eight historiographers whose sole function was to record the meetings for history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000868787|script-title=ko:\ucd98\ucd94\uad00|publisher=Doosan Encyclopedia|accessdate=2014-03-01|language=Korean}}</ref>\n*[[Seonggyungwan]] or Royal Academy (\uc131\uade0\uad00) prepared future government officials. Those who passed first two stages of [[gwageo]] examinations (literary exam) were admitted to Seonggyungwan. The class size was usually 200 students, who lived in the residential hall and followed strict routine and school rules. (Tuition, room and board were provided by the government.) It also served as the state shrine for [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] and Korean Confucian sages. The students' opinions on government policies, especially collective statements and demonstrations, could be influential as they represented fresh and uncorrupted consensus of young scholars. The official in charge was Daesaseong (\ub300\uc0ac\uc131), of 3rd senior rank, and 36 other officials including those from other offices were involved in running the academy.\n[[File:Portrait of Park Munsu.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Park Mun-su]] (1691-1756), a secret royal inspector of the Joseon Dynasty]]\n\n===Local government===\nThe officials of high rank were sent from the central government. Sometimes a [[secret royal inspector]] (Amhaeng-eosa\u00b7\uc554\ud589\uc5b4\uc0ac) was appointed by the king to travel incognito and monitor the provincial officials.

By the end of the 18th century, the yangban had acquired most of the traits of a hereditary nobility except that the status was based on a unique mixture of family position, [[gwageo]] examinations for Confucian learning, and a civil service system. The family of a yangban who did not succeed to become a government official for the third generation lost their yangban status and became commoners. For most part, the only way to become a government official was to pass a series of gwageo exams (One had to pass \"lesser gwageo\" exam (\uc18c\uacfc) in both of two stages to qualify for greater gwageo exam, which again one had to pass in both of two stages to become a government official.) The yangban and the king, in an uneasy balance, controlled the central government and military institutions. The proportion of yangban may have reached as high as 30% by 1800, due to the later practices of transaction of yangban status to peasants, although there was considerable local variation.<ref>Oh SC (2006), ''Economic growth in P'yongan Province and the development of Pyongyang in the Late Choson Period''.

A portrait painted by [[Yi Jaegwan]] (1783-1837)]]\n\nIn Joseon Dynasty, jeogori of women's [[hanbok]] became gradually tightened and shortened. In the 16th century, jeogori was baggy and reached below the waist, but by the end of Joseon Dynasty in the 19th century, jeogori was shortened to the point that it did not cover the breasts, so another piece of cloth (''heoritti'') was used to cover them. At the end of the 19th century, [[Daewon-gun]] introduced [[Magoja]], a [[Manchu]]-style jacket, to Korea, which is often worn with hanbok to this day.\n\nChima was full-skirted and jeogori was short and tight in the late Joseon period. Fullness in the skirt was emphasized round the hips. Many undergarments were worn underneath chima such as darisokgot, soksokgot, dansokgot, and gojengi to achieve a desired silhouette. Because jeogori was so short it became natural to expose heoritti or ''heorimari'' which functioned like a corset. The white linen cloth exposed under jeogori in the picture is heoritti.\n\nThe upper classes wore hanbok of closely woven [[ramie]] cloth or other high-grade lightweight materials in warm weather and of plain and patterned silks the rest of the year. Commoners were restricted by law as well as resources to cotton at best. The upper classes wore a variety of colors, though bright colors were generally worn by children and girls and subdued colors by middle-aged men and women. Commoners were restricted by law to everyday clothes of white, but for special occasions they wore dull shades of pale pink, light green, gray, and charcoal. Formally, when Korean men went outdoors, they were required to wear overcoats known as ''durumagi'' which reach the knees.\n\n=== Art ===\n{{See also|Joseon white porcelain}}\n\n[[File:\uc11c\ubb38\ubcf4 \uc0b0\uc218\ub3c4(\u5c71\u6c34\u5716) 15\uc138\uae30.jpg|thumb|Early Joseon landscape painting by Seo Munbo in the late 15th century]]\n\nThe Mid-Joseon dynasty painting styles moved towards increased [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]]. A national painting style of landscapes called \"true view\" began - moving from the traditional Chinese style of idealized general landscapes to particular locations exactly rendered. While not photographic, the style was academic enough to become established and supported as a standardized style in Korean painting. At this time China ceased to have pre-eminent influence, Korean art took its own course, and became increasingly distinctive to the traditional Chinese painting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minbaek.kr/Contents/Item/E0052156|title=\uc870\uc120\uc608\uc220(\u671d\u9bae\u85dd\u8853) - \ud55c\uad6d\ubbfc\uc871\ubb38\ud654\ub300\ubc31\uacfc\uc0ac\uc804|website=www.minbaek.kr|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\n[[File:\ubc31\uc790 \uccad\ud654\ub9e4\uc8fd\ubb38 \ud56d\uc544\ub9ac.jpg|thumb|left|15th century.

Historically overshadowed by the popularity of [[celadon]], it was not until the 15th and 16th centuries that white porcelain was recognized for its own artistic value. Among the most prized of Korean ceramics are large white jars. Their shape is symbolic of the moon and their color is associated with the ideals of purity and modesty of [[Confucianism]]. During this period, the bureau that oversaw the meals and court banquets of the royal family strictly controlled the production of white porcelain.<ref name=\"BMA\"/>\n\n[[File:Joseon white porcelain jar.jpg|thumb|White porcelain jar, 18th century, Joseon Korea]]\n[[Blue and white porcelain]] artifacts decorating white porcelain with paintings and designs in [[underglaze]] by using natural [[cobalt]] pigment are another example of popular wares of the Joseon period. Many of these items were created by court painters employed by the royal family. During this period, the popular style of landscape paintings is mirrored in the decoration of ceramics.<ref name=\"BMA\"/> Initially developed by the Chinese at the [[Jingdezhen ware|Jingdezhen kilns]] in the mid-14th century, Joseon began to produce this type of porcelain from the 15th century under Chinese influence. The first cobalt imported from China was used by Korean artists. In 1463 when sources of cobalt were discovered in [[Korea]], artists and their buyers found the material was inferior in quality and preferred the more expensive imported cobalt. Korean porcelain with imported cobalt decoration contradict the emphasis of an orderly, frugal and moderate life in [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name=\"BMA\"/>\n\nStrikingly different from cobalt, porcelain items with a copper-red [[underglaze]] are the most difficult to successfully craft. During production, these items require great skill and attention or will turn gray during the process of firing. While the birthplace of ceramics with copper red underglaze is widely disputed, these items originated during 12th century in [[Korea]] and became increasingly popular during the second half of the Joseon period. Some experts have pointed to the kilns of Bunwon-ri in [[Gwangju, Gyeonggi]], a city that played a significant role in the production of ceramics during the Joseon period, as a possible birthplace.<ref name=\"BMA\"/>\n\nPorcelain was also decorated with iron.

However Buddhism actually was a part of the Joseon dynasty. When studying literary exchanges between Confucian scholar officials, and Buddhist it is showing that Buddhism was not cast out. There literary exchanges show a middle ground of both philosophies. \"scholar-officials - Some who in public castigated Buddhism as a heresy and deluded tradition, in private visited temples and associated closely with monks.\" This shows that while in public some scholars shamed Buddhism their exchanges with Buddhists show that in the very least it was not cast outside of their dynasty.\n\nOne example of this is a famous Joseon scholar official {{interlanguage link|Pak Sedang|ko|\ubc15\uc138\ub2f9}} (\ubc15\uc138\ub2f9, \u6734\u4e16\u5802, 1629\u20131703).

The first copy of ''sijo'' is of the 'Twelve Songs of ''Dosan''<nowiki/>' by ''Yi Hwang'' written in 1565, which were written 100 years after the proclamation of [[Hangul]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rutt|first=Richard|title=The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=157}}</ref> Additionally, the first anthology of ''sijo'' was compiled by ''Kim Cheontaek'' in 1728<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rutt|first=Richard|title=The Bamboo Grove: An Introduction to Sijo|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=158}}</ref>; before the anthology few ''sijo'' were written.\n\n''Kim Cheontaek''<nowiki/>'s anthology represents a change in the authorship of ''sijo''.\u2002At first, ''sijo'' were primarily composed by the [[Yangban|''yangban'']] aristocracy and entertainers of the ''[[Kisaeng]]'' class.\u2002However, by the mid-seventeenth century, the [[Chungin|''jungin'']] or \u201cprofessional class\u201d were composing ''sijo'' as well.\u2002This also coincided with a new form of ''sijo'' called \u201cnarrative ''sijo''\u201d (Hangul: \uc0ac\uc124\uc2dc\uc870/Hanja: \u8fad\u8aaa\u6642\u8abf), in which the first two lines were greatly lengthened.\u2002<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kim|first=Hy\u016dnggyu|title=Understanding Korean Literature|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}</ref>This expansion is likely a development from the so-called \u201cirregular ''sijo''\u201d (Hangul: \uc5c7\uc2dc\uc870/Hanja: \u65d5\u6642\u8abf), in which there was a minor lengthening of one of the first two lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naver.com|title=Naver|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\u2002While there are very few remaining irregular ''sijo'', and the form has not been revived, there is a sizable body of narrative ''sijo'' and the form continues to evolve.\n\n''[[Pansori|P'ansori]]''  (Hangul: \ud310\uc18c\ub9ac) is another musical form that combines singing and prose to portray a story. Its development likely originates from shaman rituals and the songs within the [[Jeolla Province|''Jeolla'' Province]].\u2002It became a full-fledged musical form by the middle of the eighteenth century, and not long thereafter the yangban aristocracy also became interested in it.\u2002Originally there was a set of twelve stories that were sung, but only five were written down, and hence those five are the only ones sung today.\u2002Having been developed by commoners, ''p'ansori'' usually reflected their attitudes and aspirations, but by becoming popular with the ''yangban'', ''p'ansori'' shifted somewhat toward ''yangban'' sensibilities and restrictions.\u2002''P'ansori'' had a strong influence of the writing of the time, both because of the ''p'ansori'' novel (each based on one of the twelve stories) and by increasing the realism of the classical novel.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{See also|History of science and technology in Korea}}\n[[File:Korean celestial globe.jpg|thumb|Korean [[celestial globe]] first made by the scientist [[Jang Yeong-sil]] during the reign of [[King Sejong]]]]\n\n=== 15th century ===\nThe Joseon Dynasty under the reign of [[Sejong the Great]] was Korea's greatest period of scientific advancement. Under Sejong's new policy, [[Cheonmin]] (low-status) people such as [[Jang Yeong-sil]] were allowed to work for the government. At a young age, Jang displayed talent as an inventor and engineer, creating machines to facilitate agricultural work. These included supervising the building of aqueducts and canals. Jang eventually was allowed to live at the royal palace, where he led a group of scientists to work on advancing Korea's science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSome of his inventions were an automated (self-striking) [[water clock]] (the Jagyeokru) which worked by activating motions of wooden figures to indicate time visually (invented in 1434 by Jang), a subsequent more complicated water-clock with additional astronomical devices, and an improved model of the previous metal movable printing type created in the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. The new model was of even higher quality and was twice as fast. Other inventions were the [[sight glass]], and the [[udometer]].\n\nThe highpoint of Korean astronomy was during the Joseon period, where men such as Jang created devices such as celestial globes which indicated the positions of the sun, moon, and the stars.<ref>{{cite book | author=\ubc31\uc11d\uae30 | title=\uc6c5\uc9c4\uc704\uc778\uc804\uae30 #11 \uc7a5\uc601\uc2e4 | publisher=\uc6c5\uc9c4\ucd9c\ud310\uc0ac | year=1987 | page=56}}</ref> Later celestial globes (Gyupyo, \uaddc\ud45c) were attuned to the seasonal variations.\n\nThe apex of astronomical and calendarial advances under [[King Sejong]] was the [[Chiljeongsan]], which compiled computations of the courses of the seven heavenly objects (five visible planets, the sun, and moon),\ndeveloped in 1442. This work made it possible for scientists to calculate and accurately predict all the major heavenly phenomena, such as solar eclipses and other stellar movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~easc/resources/korea_slides/science/9-1.htm|title=Korea And The Korean People<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[Honcheonsigye]] is an astronomical clock created by [[Song I-yeong]] in 1669. The clock has an armillary sphere with a diameter of 40&nbsp;cm. The sphere is activated by a working clock mechanism, showing the position of celestial objects at any given time.\n\n[[Kangnido]], a Korean-made map of the world was created in 1402 by [[Kim Sa-hyeong]] (\uae40\uc0ac\ud615, \u91d1\u58eb\u8861), [[Yi Mu (early Joseon)|Yi Mu]] (\uc774\ubb34, \u674e\u8302) and [[Yi Hoe]] (\uc774\ud68c, \u674e\u6493). The map was created in the second year of the reign of [[Taejong of Joseon]]. The map was made by combining Chinese, Korean and Japanese maps.\n\n=== 16th\u201319th century ===\nThe scientific and technological advance in the late Joseon Dynasty was less progressed than the early Joseon period.\n\n16th-century court physician, [[Heo Jun]] wrote a number of medical texts, his most significant achievement being [[Dongeui Bogam]], which is often noted as the defining text of [[Traditional Korean medicine]]. The work spread to [[China]] and [[Japan]], where it is still regarded as one of the classics of [[Oriental medicine]] today.\n\nThe first soft [[ballistic vest]], [[Myunjebaegab]], was invented in Joseon [[Korea]] in the 1860s shortly after the [[French campaign against Korea (1866)]]. [[Heungseon Daewongun]] ordered development of bullet-proof armor because of increasing threats from Western armies. [[Kim Gi-du]] and [[Gang Yun]] found that [[cotton]] could protect against bullets if thick enough, and devised bullet-proof vests made of 30 layers of cotton. The vests were used in battle during the [[United States expedition to Korea]] (1871), when the US Navy attacked [[Ganghwa Island]] in 1871. The US Army captured one of the vests and took it to the US, where it was stored at the [[Smithsonian Museum]] until 2007. The vest has since been sent back to Korea and is currently on display to the public.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Commerce ===\nDuring the Goryeo Dynasty, Korea had a healthy trade relationship with the Japanese, Chinese, and Manchurians. An example of prosperous, international trade port is [[Pyongnam]]. Koreans offered [[brocades]], jewelries, [[ginseng]], [[silk]], and [[porcelain]], renowned famous worldwide. But, during the Joseon Dynasty, Confucianism was adopted as the national philosophy, and, in process of eliminating certain [[Buddhist]] beliefs, [[Korean pottery and porcelain#Goryeo Dynasty|Goryeo Cheongja]] porcelains were replaced by white [[Baekja]], which lost favour of the Chinese. Also, commerce became more restricted during this time in order to promote agriculture. Because silver was used as currency in China, it played an important role in Korea-China trade. \n<!--===Agriculture===\n===Coinage===\n===Manufactures=== \n===Taxation===\n===Land systems===\n===Sprouts of capitalism===\n==Foreign relations==-->\n\n==Titles and styles during Joseon Kingdom==\n{{main|Styles and titles in the Joseon dynasty}}\nTitles and styles used inside the royal family were stratified along the generations and relative to the current King.\n\n== House of Yi ==\n{{Main|House of Yi}}\n{{see also|House of Yi#House of Yi family tree|label 1=The family tree of Joseon kings}}\n[[File:Fuuzokugahou-Myeongseong.gif|thumb|Japanese illustration of [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and Queen Min receiving [[Inoue Kaoru]]]]\n[[File:Choseon Imperial family.jpg|thumb|This compilation photo, taken about 1915, shows the following royal family members, from left: [[Prince Imperial Ui|Prince Ui (''Ui chinwang'' \uc758\uce5c\uc655)]], the 6th son of Gojong; [[Emperor Sunjong of the Korean Empire|Sunjong]], the 2nd son and the last monarch of Joseon; [[Crown Prince Euimin|Prince Yeong (''Yeong chinwang'' \uc601\uce5c\uc655)]], the 7th son; [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]], the former King; [[Empress Sunjeong of the Korean Empire|Queen Yoon (''Yoon daebi'')]], Queen Consort of Sunjong; Deogindang Gimbi, wife of Prince Ui; and [[Kenichi Momoyama|Yi Geon]], the eldest son of Prince Ui.

The town is located in the area later known as the [[Dust Bowl]], and is being hit hard by the drought and resultant dust storms. \n\nThe local farmers and townspeople want to try to save their farms and the town by adopting new farming methods, but are eventually convinced by the Department of Agriculture, and the continuing dust storms to pack up the whole town and move en-masse to an undeveloped portion of [[Oregon]]. There a new dam is set to create a water supply, enabling them to build a new farming community.\n\nIn a then-contemporary version of an old [[wagon train]], the town moves as a convoy of cars to Oregon, under John Phillips's leadership, not without differences of opinion and friction among the followers. \n\nThe doctor and his daughter take a detour to [[San Francisco]] when they learn that the daughter's fiance was not killed by the Nazis in [[Austria]], but has instead come to America. However, the fiance has embraced Nazism, and their different ideologies now mean marriage is not possible. The doctor and his daughter rejoin the transplanted town in Oregon, where the daughter marries Phillips instead (John Wayne).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Wayne]] as John Phillips\n* [[Sigrid Gurie]] as Leni \"Lenchen\" Braun\n* [[Charles Coburn]] as Dr. Karl Braun\n* [[Spencer Charters]] as Dr. \"Nunk\" Atterbury\n* Helen MacKellar as Mrs. Welles\n* [[Roland Varno]] as Dr. Eric Von Scherer\n* [[Sonny Bupp]] as Billy Welles\n* [[Wade Boteler]] as Mr. Harris, Department of Agriculture Official\n* [[Trevor Bardette]] as Clem Higgins\n* [[Russell Simpson (actor)|Russell Simpson]] as Minister\n* [[Charles Waldron]] as Dr. William Thorpe\n* [[Wendell Niles]] as Man-on-the-Street Radio Announcer\n\n==See also==\n* [[John Wayne filmography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|971|Three Faces West}}\n* {{tcmdb title|93082|Three Faces West}}\n* {{IMDb title|0033159|Three Faces West}}\n* {{Allmovie title|49661|Three Faces West}}\n\n{{Bernard Vorhaus}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Three Faces West}}\n[[Category:1940 films]]\n[[Category:1940s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Victor Young]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bernard Vorhaus]]\n[[Category:Films set in North Dakota]]\n[[Category:Films set in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Sol C.
