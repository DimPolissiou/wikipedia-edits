Frustrated by [[cocaine]] addiction and his suspicion that his fellow gang members wanted him dead, he became a government [[informant]].

He was arrested in March 2004 for sexually assaulting a young boy and received four more years. In 2007, Trudeau learned he had cancer and was transferred to a medical centre from Archambault penitentiary.<ref name = \"Canada\"/>\n\n==Background==\nThe years 1936 to 1960 is a period of history known to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as the ''[[Grande Noirceur]]'' (\"Great Darkness\") when Quebec was mostly ruled by the ultra-conservative Catholic ''Union Nationale'' party.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} Starting with the 1960 provincial election, which saw the ''Union Nationale'' defeated by the Quebec Liberals, Quebec society experienced sweeping changes known as the [[Quiet Revolution]] that saw Quebec go in the space of a decade from being one of the most conservative societies in North America to being one of the most liberal.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} As part of the reaction against the \"medieval\" Catholic social mores of the ''Grande Noirceur'', the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois embraced a culture of hedonism in the 1960s with Quebec having for example a significantly higher rate of illegitimate births and drug use than English Canada.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} As part of the same backlash against the \"suffocating\" conformism of the ''Grande Noirceur'', outlaw biker clubs became very popular in Quebec in the 1960s with many French-Canadian young men seeing the outlaw biker culture as a symbol of freedom, rebellion and machismo, and by 1968 ''la belle province'' had 350 outlaw biker clubs.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} One result of Quebec having so many outlaw biker clubs was a degree of violence and viciousness between the different outlaw biker clubs that had no parallel in the rest of Canada as there were too many biker clubs seeking their share of the organized crime rackets, giving Quebec the reputation as the \"Red Zone\" in the outlaw biker world.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} Dubro stated about the distinctive outlaw biker sub-culture of Quebec: \"There's always has been more violence in Quebec. In the biker world it's known as the Red Zone. I remember an Outlaws hit man telling me he was scared going to Montreal.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nThe Popeyes, led by [[Yves Buteau]],  were the Quebec club that would eventually become Canada's first Hells Angels chapter. They were considered to be the most violent outlaw biker club in Quebec, and were infamous for engaging in gratuitous and sadistic violence that attracted the attention of the Hells Angels.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=33}} The Popeyes were often employed by the Montreal Mafia to perform murders for them.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=33}}\n\n==Hell's Angels==\nIn 1968, Trudeau joined the Popeyes.<ref name = \"VICE\">{{cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/zm3y4e/how-canadas-most-prolific-hit-man-turned-informant-on-the-hells-angels|title = How Canada's Most Prolific Hit Man Turned Informant on the Hells Angels|last = Lejtenyi|first = Patrick|publisher = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date = 26 September 2017|website = vice.com|accessdate = 7 December 2017}}</ref>  Later, Trudeau would be a founding member of the Hells Angels in [[Quebec]] in 1977 after the Popeyes patched over.<ref name = \"Canada\"/> The crime journalist James Dubro said in an interview: \"He had this fascination early in life with bikers and military things and weapons and bombs.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/> Trudeau took a job with an explosives factory to learn how to handle explosives and would become an expert at building bombs.<ref name = \"VICE\"/> Pierre de Champlain, a former RCMP officer who wrote the book ''Histoire du crime organis\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al'' stated in an interview: \"He was very professional, very meticulous, and that's why they used his services.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/> Trudeau scalped one of his victims, which earned him the moniker Apache.<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nIn September 1979, Trudeau and others broke away from the [[Montreal]] Chapter to form the North Chapter, based in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]]. The group would become known for its violent and reckless behaviour and excessive drug use.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} The North chapter were mostly former Popeyes, and still retained Popeye attitudes, in marked contrast to the Montreal South chapter headed by R\u00e9jean \"Zig Zig\" Lessard, which consisted of men who joined the Angels after 1977 and were more disciplined.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=85-86}} After [[Yves Buteau|Yves \"Le Boss\" Buteau]] was assassinated by the Outlaws on 8 September 1983, the man who replaced him as president of the North chapter, Laurent \"L'Anglais\" Viau, had a more tolerant and relaxed attitude towards violence and drug use.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=85-86}} Under Viau's leadership, the Laval chapter, which had often chafed at Buteau's rules, got out of control.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=85-86}}\n\nStanding five-foot-six, weighing 135 pounds and clean shaven with short hair, Trudeau did not resemble the prototypical biker, but he is considered to be the [[Hells Angels]]' most prolific killer.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} Other Angels weighed between 300-400 pounds, had an average height of 6'0 feet, and had long hair and beards, leading the journalist Jerry Langton to write that \"...nobody would have guessed he was the club's enforcer and primary weapon\".{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} The Irish-Canadian [[West End Gang]], who controlled the Port of Montreal and thus the importation of drugs into Quebec, frequently made use of Trudeau's services to liquidate their rivals.<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nTrudeau admitted to killing 43 people from September 1973 to July 1985. He was the first Canadian Hells Angel to earn the \"Filthy Few\" patch, awarded to members who have killed for the club. During a biker war between the Hells Angels and the [[Outlaws Motorcycle Club|Outlaws]] for control of Montreal's drug trade between 1978\u201383, Trudeau killed 18 out of the 23 Outlaws slain during the conflict.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} Langton called Trudeau a \"psychopathic killer\" and a \"killing machine\" par excellence, who was the Angels' most dangerous killer.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=81 & 133}} Dubro stated about Trudeau: \"He had absolutely no conscience, no respect for human life at all.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/> To assist with his killings, Trudeau started to heavily use cocaine. Dubro commented: \"Most of the hit men I've met have been cokeheads, and they usually coke up before doing the killings. Makes it a little easier. Not all of them, but alcoholism and drug use is very common among hit men.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\n===Lennoxville massacre===\n{{main|Lennoxville massacre}}\nTrudeau claimed that West End Gang chieftain [[Frank \"Dunie\" Ryan]]'s successor, Allan \"The Weasel\" Ross, had offered to pay him $200,000 to eliminate Ryan's killers, but Ross later told Trudeau to collect from the Halifax Chapter instead.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=86}} When the leader of the Halifax chapter, David \"Wolf\" Carroll, paid Trudeau $98,000, he learned that the Montreal North chapter was actually entitled to one-quarter of the money, and that Trudeau had used the money to support his cocaine addiction.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=86}} As the Halifax chapter was poorer than the Laval chapter, Trudeau's behaviour was considered to be especially crass.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=86}}\n\nThis only added to the resentment many Hells Angels already felt towards members of the North Chapter. Other Hells Angels felt that the North Chapter bikers were too wild and uncontrollable. They often used drugs they were supposed to sell and were suspected of cheating other chapters out of drug profits. A decision was made to liquidate the North Chapter, in what would be known in biker history as the [[Lennoxville massacre]].\n\nA meeting was set up at the [[Sherbrooke]] Chapter's clubhouse in [[Lennoxville]] on March 24, 1985. At that gathering, five members of the North Chapter were shot to death, wrapped in sleeping bags, and dumped in the St. Lawrence River. The others were allowed to live and were absorbed into the Montreal Chapter.\n\nTrudeau was supposed to be at that meeting, but had enrolled in a [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]] program the week before. He later said he wanted to clean himself up, because he knew what happened to members who were always high. News of the North Chapter slaughter soon reached Trudeau at the detox centre in [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]], and Trudeau received a visit from a Montreal Chapter representative. Trudeau was told that he was out of the club and would have to have his club tattoos removed.\n\n==Informant==\nAfter his release from the detox centre, Trudeau discovered that the Hells Angels had taken his motorcycle and $46,000 in cash that belonged to him from the North Chapter clubhouse. They said they would return the bike if he killed two people for the gang. Trudeau succeeded in killing one of the targets. Jean-Marc Deniger was killed in May 1985 and stuffed in his car. Satisfied, the Hells Angels gave Trudeau his motorcycle back.\n\nBut Trudeau knew he was living on borrowed time. The Hells Angels had taken out a $50,000 contract on his head. He decided to become a police informant and government witness.\n\nIn 1985, Trudeau pleaded guilty to 43 counts of [[manslaughter]], meaning that as far as the Crown is concerned, Trudeau did not intentionally kill his 43 victims \u2013 29 of whom died from firearms, 10 from bombs, three from being beaten to death, and one from strangulation. Police estimated 30 to 35 of his victims were other motorcycle gang members or sympathizers. Trudeau also testified on 40 other murders and 15 attempted murders. The Conservative senator [[Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu]] questioned the value of the plea bargain the Crown reached with Trudeau, saying: \"Apache Trudeau didn't have to fight for his money, he didn't have to fight to be well treated. These are programs that cost us millions of dollars. The criminals take advantage of protection that isn't available to victims and a lot of the criminals who turned informant will wind up being recidivist.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nAs part of his controversial contract with the government, Trudeau was sentenced to life in prison, with eligibility for [[parole]] in seven years. Under his deal, the government also gave him $40,000 over the next four years and about $35 a week for cigarettes.\n\n==Release from prison==\nTrudeau was granted parole in 1994 and given a new identity. He lived under the name Denis C\u00f4t\u00e9 and worked as an orderly in a nursing home. However, after being laid off in 2000, he slid back into cocaine addiction and sexually assaulted a 13-year-old boy, for which he pleaded guilty in 2004. He was sentenced to a four-year prison term.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/coming-clean-on-witness-protection/article687212/|title = Coming clean on witness protection|last1 = McArthur|first1 = Greg|last2 = Thanh Ha|first2 = Tu|publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]]|date = 5 June 2007|website = theglobeandmail.com|accessdate = 18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Trudeau was diagnosed with [[bone-marrow cancer]].

Frustrated by [[cocaine]] addiction and his suspicion that his fellow gang members wanted him dead, he became a government [[informant]].

He was arrested in March 2004 for sexually assaulting a young boy and received four more years. In 2007, Trudeau learned he had cancer and was transferred to a medical centre from Archambault penitentiary.<ref name = \"Canada\"/>\n\n==Background==\nThe years 1936 to 1960 is a period of history known to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as the ''[[Grande Noirceur]]'' (\"Great Darkness\") when Quebec was mostly ruled by the ultra-conservative Catholic ''Union Nationale'' party.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} Starting with the 1960 provincial election, which saw the ''Union Nationale'' defeated by the Quebec Liberals, Quebec society experienced sweeping changes known as the [[Quiet Revolution]] that saw Quebec go in the space of a decade from being one of the most conservative societies in North America to being one of the most liberal.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} As part of the reaction against the \"medieval\" Catholic social mores of the ''Grande Noirceur'', the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois embraced a culture of hedonism in the 1960s with Quebec having for example a significantly higher rate of illegitimate births and drug use than English Canada.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} As part of the same backlash against the \"suffocating\" conformism of the ''Grande Noirceur'', outlaw biker clubs became very popular in Quebec in the 1960s with many French-Canadian young men seeing the outlaw biker culture as a symbol of freedom, rebellion and machismo, and by 1968 ''la belle province'' had 350 outlaw biker clubs.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} One result of Quebec having so many outlaw biker clubs was a degree of violence and viciousness between the different outlaw biker clubs that had no parallel in the rest of Canada as there were too many biker clubs seeking their share of the organized crime rackets, giving Quebec the reputation as the \"Red Zone\" in the outlaw biker world.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=32}} Dubro stated about the distinctive outlaw biker sub-culture of Quebec: \"There's always has been more violence in Quebec. In the biker world it's known as the Red Zone. I remember an Outlaws hit man telling me he was scared going to Montreal.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nThe Popeyes, led by [[Yves Buteau]],  were the Quebec club that would eventually become Canada's first Hells Angels chapter. They were considered to be the most violent outlaw biker club in Quebec, and were infamous for engaging in gratuitous and sadistic violence that attracted the attention of the Hells Angels.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=33}} The Popeyes were often employed by the Montreal Mafia to perform murders for them.{{sfn|Langton|2006|p=33}}\n\n==Hell's Angels==\nIn 1968, Trudeau joined the Popeyes.<ref name = \"VICE\">{{cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/zm3y4e/how-canadas-most-prolific-hit-man-turned-informant-on-the-hells-angels|title = How Canada's Most Prolific Hit Man Turned Informant on the Hells Angels|last = Lejtenyi|first = Patrick|publisher = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date = 26 September 2017|website = vice.com|accessdate = 7 December 2017}}</ref>  Later, Trudeau would be a founding member of the Hells Angels in [[Quebec]] in 1977 after the Popeyes patched over.<ref name = \"Canada\"/> The crime journalist James Dubro said in an interview: \"He had this fascination early in life with bikers and military things and weapons and bombs.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/> Trudeau took a job with an explosives factory to learn how to handle explosives and would become an expert at building bombs.<ref name = \"VICE\"/> Pierre de Champlain, a former RCMP officer who wrote the book ''Histoire du crime organis\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al'' stated in an interview: \"He was very professional, very meticulous, and that's why they used his services.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/> Trudeau scalped one of his victims, which earned him the moniker Apache.<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nIn September 1979, Trudeau and others broke away from the [[Montreal]] Chapter to form the North Chapter, based in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]]. The group would become known for its violent and reckless behaviour and excessive drug use.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} The North chapter were mostly former Popeyes, and still retained Popeye attitudes, in marked contrast to the Montreal South chapter headed by R\u00e9jean \"Zig Zig\" Lessard, which consisted of men who joined the Angels after 1977 and were more disciplined.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=85-86}} After [[Yves Buteau|Yves \"Le Boss\" Buteau]] was assassinated by the Outlaws on 8 September 1983, the man who replaced him as president of the North chapter, Laurent \"L'Anglais\" Viau, had a more tolerant and relaxed attitude towards violence and drug use.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=85-86}} Under Viau's leadership, the Laval chapter, which had often chafed at Buteau's rules, got out of control.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=85-86}}\n\nStanding five-foot-six, weighing 135 pounds and clean shaven with short hair, Trudeau did not resemble the prototypical biker, but he is considered to be the [[Hells Angels]]' most prolific killer.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} Other Angels weighed between 300-400 pounds, had an average height of 6'0 feet, and had long hair and beards, leading the journalist Jerry Langton to write that \"...nobody would have guessed he was the club's enforcer and primary weapon\".{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} The Irish-Canadian [[West End Gang]], who controlled the Port of Montreal and thus the importation of drugs into Quebec, frequently made use of Trudeau's services to liquidate their rivals.<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nTrudeau admitted to killing 43 people from September 1973 to July 1985. He was the first Canadian Hells Angel to earn the \"Filthy Few\" patch, awarded to members who have killed for the club. During a biker war between the Hells Angels and the [[Outlaws Motorcycle Club|Outlaws]] for control of Montreal's drug trade between 1978\u201383, Trudeau killed 18 out of the 23 Outlaws slain during the conflict.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=58}} Langton called Trudeau a \"psychopathic killer\" and a \"killing machine\" par excellence, who was the Angels' most dangerous killer.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=81 & 133}} Dubro stated about Trudeau: \"He had absolutely no conscience, no respect for human life at all.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/> To assist with his killings, Trudeau started to heavily use cocaine. Dubro commented: \"Most of the hit men I've met have been cokeheads, and they usually coke up before doing the killings. Makes it a little easier. Not all of them, but alcoholism and drug use is very common among hit men.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\n===Lennoxville massacre===\n{{main|Lennoxville massacre}}\nTrudeau claimed that West End Gang chieftain [[Frank \"Dunie\" Ryan]]'s successor, Allan \"The Weasel\" Ross, had offered to pay him $200,000 to eliminate Ryan's killers, but Ross later told Trudeau to collect from the Halifax Chapter instead.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=86}} When the leader of the Halifax chapter, David \"Wolf\" Carroll, paid Trudeau $98,000, he learned that the Montreal North chapter was actually entitled to one-quarter of the money, and that Trudeau had used the money to support his cocaine addiction.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=86}} As the Halifax chapter was poorer than the Laval chapter, Trudeau's behaviour was considered to be especially crass.{{sfn|Langton|2010|p=86}}\n\nThis only added to the resentment many Hells Angels already felt towards members of the North Chapter. Other Hells Angels felt that the North Chapter bikers were too wild and uncontrollable. They often used drugs they were supposed to sell and were suspected of cheating other chapters out of drug profits. A decision was made to liquidate the North Chapter, in what would be known in biker history as the [[Lennoxville massacre]].\n\nA meeting was set up at the [[Sherbrooke]] Chapter's clubhouse in [[Lennoxville]] on March 24, 1985. At that gathering, five members of the North Chapter were shot to death, wrapped in sleeping bags, and dumped in the St. Lawrence River. The others were allowed to live and were absorbed into the Montreal Chapter.\n\nTrudeau was supposed to be at that meeting, but had enrolled in a [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]] program the week before. He later said he wanted to clean himself up, because he knew what happened to members who were always high. News of the North Chapter slaughter soon reached Trudeau at the detox centre in [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]], and Trudeau received a visit from a Montreal Chapter representative. Trudeau was told that he was out of the club and would have to have his club tattoos removed.\n\n==Informant==\nAfter his release from the detox centre, Trudeau discovered that the Hells Angels had taken his motorcycle and $46,000 in cash that belonged to him from the North Chapter clubhouse. They said they would return the bike if he killed two people for the gang. Trudeau succeeded in killing one of the targets. Jean-Marc Deniger was killed in May 1985 and stuffed in his car. Satisfied, the Hells Angels gave Trudeau his motorcycle back.\n\nBut Trudeau knew he was living on borrowed time. The Hells Angels had taken out a $50,000 contract on his head. He decided to become a police informant and government witness.\n\nIn 1985, Trudeau pleaded guilty to 43 counts of [[manslaughter]], meaning that as far as the Crown is concerned, Trudeau did not intentionally kill his 43 victims \u2013 29 of whom died from firearms, 10 from bombs, three from being beaten to death, and one from strangulation. Police estimated 30 to 35 of his victims were other motorcycle gang members or sympathizers. Trudeau also testified on 40 other murders and 15 attempted murders. The Conservative senator [[Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu]] questioned the value of the plea bargain the Crown reached with Trudeau, saying: \"Apache Trudeau didn't have to fight for his money, he didn't have to fight to be well treated. These are programs that cost us millions of dollars. The criminals take advantage of protection that isn't available to victims and a lot of the criminals who turned informant will wind up being recidivist.\"<ref name = \"VICE\"/>\n\nAs part of his controversial contract with the government, Trudeau was sentenced to life in prison, with eligibility for [[parole]] in seven years. Under his deal, the government also gave him $40,000 over the next four years and about $35 a week for cigarettes.\n\n==Release from prison==\nTrudeau was granted parole in 1994 and given a new identity. He lived under the name Denis C\u00f4t\u00e9 and worked as an orderly in a nursing home. However, after being laid off in 2000, he slid back into cocaine addiction and sexually assaulted a 13-year-old boy, for which he pleaded guilty in 2004. He was sentenced to a four-year prison term.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/coming-clean-on-witness-protection/article687212/|title = Coming clean on witness protection|last1 = McArthur|first1 = Greg|last2 = Thanh Ha|first2 = Tu|publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]]|date = 5 June 2007|website = theglobeandmail.com|accessdate = 18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Trudeau was diagnosed with [[bone-marrow cancer]].

The Political Parties Act defines political parties as \"political groups consisting of [[Taiwanese nationality law|ROC citizens]] with a common political ideology who safeguard the free, democratic, constitutional order, assist in shaping the political will of the people, and nominate candidates for election to public office.\"<ref name=\"cnappapass\">{{cite news |last1=Chen |first1=Chun-hua |last2=Liu |first2=Kuan-lin |title=Legislature passes Political Party Act |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201711100020.aspx |accessdate=18 November 2019 |agency=Central News Agency |date=10 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"cnappa2019\">{{cite news |last1=Ku |first1=Chuan |last2=Kao |first2=Evelyn |title=46 groups yet to transition to political parties as required by law |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201911170012.aspx |accessdate=18 November 2019 |agency=Central News Agency |date=17 November 2019}} Republished as: {{cite news |title=2020 ELECTIONS: MOI says 46 political groups have yet to make shift |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/11/19/2003726123 |accessdate=19 November 2019 |work=Taipei Times |date=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nGroups established when the Civil Associations Act was in effect should have revised their charters to comply with the Political Parties Act by 7 December 2019. To be compliant with the Political Parties Act, political groups must additionally convene a representative assembly or party congress for four consecutive years and have followed relevant laws and regulations governing the nomination of candidates to campaign in elections for public office for the same time period. Within one year of filing for political party status, a political group must complete legal person registration. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Taiwan)|Ministry of the Interior]] requires that political parties submit annual property and financial statements. Political organizations that do not meet these regulations were dissolved and removed from the registry of political parties.<ref name=\"cnappapass\"/><ref name=\"cnappa2019\"/>\n\n== Current parties

[[Taish\u014d period]] (Taish\u014d Democracy). Taiwanese political movements at this time were to modify the discriminatory colonial laws established in earlier years, and to setup local autonomy systems like in [[Mainland Japan]]. The largest political movement at this time was the [[Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament]]. At the same time, the [[History of communism|International Communist Movement]] also influenced [[Taiwan]], many [[Left-wing politics|Left-wing]] parties and organizations were also established.\n\nNotable Taiwanese parties during this time are:\n* [[Taiwan D\u014dkakai]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u540c\u5316\u6703}}, [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n T\u00f4ng-h\u00f2a-h\u014de'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan D\u014dkakai'')\n* [[New People Society]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u65b0\u6c11\u6703}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''Sin-b\u00een-h\u014de'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Shinminkai'')\n* [[Taiwanese Cultural Association]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u6587\u5316\u5354\u6703}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n B\u00fbn-h\u00f2a Hia\u030dp-h\u014de'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Bunka Ky\u014dkai'')\n* [[Taiwanese Federation of Workers' Unions]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u5de5\u53cb\u7e3d\u806f\u76df}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n Kang-i\u00fa Ch\u00f3ng Li\u00e2n-b\u00eang'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan K\u014dy\u016b S\u014drenmei'')\n* [[Taiwanese Peasants Union]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u8fb2\u6c11\u7d44\u5408}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n L\u00f4ng-b\u00een Cho\u0358-ha\u030dp'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan N\u014dmin Kumiai'')\n* [[Taiwanese Communist Party]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u5171\u7522\u9ee8}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n Ki\u014dng-s\u00e1n T\u00f3ng'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Ky\u014dsan-t\u014d'')\n* [[Taiwanese People's Party]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u9ee8}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n B\u00een-chi\u00f2ng T\u00f3ng'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Minshu-t\u014d'')\n* [[Taiwan Local Autonomy Union]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u5730\u65b9\u81ea\u6cbb\u806f\u76df}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n T\u0113-hng Ch\u016b-t\u012b Li\u00e2n-b\u00eang'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Tih\u014d-jiti Renmei'')\n\nAt the same time, the political parties in [[Mainland Japan]] also affected Taiwan.

From 1945 until 1949, [[political parties in China]] which had operated covertly under Japanese rule were permitted to operate in Taiwan province. The ruling [[Kuomintang]] set up formal branches in Taiwan, and so did other major political parties including the [[Communist Party of China]] (in 1946). Although it had no formal connection with the Taiwanese Communist Party suppressed by Japanese authorities in the 1930s (which was instead affiliated with the Communist Party of Japan), the Taiwan branch of the Communist Party of China absorbed many former members of the Taiwanese Communist Party. However, against the backdrop of the [[Chinese Civil War]] which erupted soon after the retrocession of Taiwan, the Kuomintang-controlled Republic of China government attempted to restrict the operation of Communist Party of China cells in Taiwan, and other opposition parties. \n\n=== Taiwan after 1949 ===\nWith the Republic of China government rapidly losing the Chinese civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]], the ruling [[Kuomintang]] began preparing to move the government to Taiwan in 1949. Taiwan was placed under [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] from 19 May 1949 to 15 July 1987. The Taiwan provincial branch of the Communist Party of China was particularly targeted, and by 1952 had been completely destroyed.\n\nDuring this time, all forms of [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] were forbidden by the government, only three political parties who retreated to [[Taiwan]] were allowed to participate the elections.\n* [[Kuomintang]] ({{zh|t=\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8 |p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 Gu\u00f3m\u00ednd\u01ceng}}; [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]: ''Tiong-kok Kok-b\u00een-t\u00f3ng''){{NoteTag|KMT's prior body was [[Revive China Society]] ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u8208\u4e2d\u6703 |p=x\u012bngzh\u014dnghu\u00ec}}), founded on 24 November 1894.

To be compliant with the Political Parties Act, political groups must additionally convene a representative assembly or party congress for four consecutive years and have followed relevant laws and regulations governing the nomination of candidates to campaign in elections for public office for the same time period. Within one year of filing for political party status, a political group must complete legal person registration. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Taiwan)|Ministry of the Interior]] requires that political parties submit annual property and financial statements.

[[Taish\u014d period]] (Taish\u014d Democracy). Taiwanese political movements at this time were to modify the discriminatory colonial laws established in earlier years, and to setup local autonomy systems like in [[Mainland Japan]]. The largest political movement at this time was the [[Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament]]. At the same time, the [[History of communism|International Communist Movement]] also influenced [[Taiwan]], many [[Left-wing politics|Left-wing]] parties and organizations were also established.\n\nNotable Taiwanese parties during this time are:\n* [[Taiwan D\u014dkakai]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u540c\u5316\u6703}}, [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n T\u00f4ng-h\u00f2a-h\u014de'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan D\u014dkakai'')\n* [[New People Society]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u65b0\u6c11\u6703}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''Sin-b\u00een-h\u014de'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Shinminkai'')\n* [[Taiwanese Cultural Association]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u6587\u5316\u5354\u6703}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n B\u00fbn-h\u00f2a Hia\u030dp-h\u014de'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Bunka Ky\u014dkai'')\n* [[Taiwanese Federation of Workers' Unions]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u5de5\u53cb\u7e3d\u806f\u76df}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n Kang-i\u00fa Ch\u00f3ng Li\u00e2n-b\u00eang'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan K\u014dy\u016b S\u014drenmei'')\n* [[Taiwanese Peasants Union]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u8fb2\u6c11\u7d44\u5408}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n L\u00f4ng-b\u00een Cho\u0358-ha\u030dp'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan N\u014dmin Kumiai'')\n* [[Taiwanese Communist Party]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u5171\u7522\u9ee8}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n Ki\u014dng-s\u00e1n T\u00f3ng'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Ky\u014dsan-t\u014d'')\n* [[Taiwanese People's Party]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u6c11\u773e\u9ee8}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n B\u00een-chi\u00f2ng T\u00f3ng'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Minshu-t\u014d'')\n* [[Taiwan Local Autonomy Union]] ({{lang|zh-tw|\u81fa\u7063\u5730\u65b9\u81ea\u6cbb\u806f\u76df}}, Taiwanese Hokkien: ''T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n T\u0113-hng Ch\u016b-t\u012b Li\u00e2n-b\u00eang'', [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]: ''Taiwan Tih\u014d-jiti Renmei'')\n\nAt the same time, the political parties in [[Mainland Japan]] also affected Taiwan.

From 1945 until 1949, [[political parties in China]] which had operated covertly under Japanese rule were permitted to operate in Taiwan province. The ruling [[Kuomintang]] set up formal branches in Taiwan, and so did other major political parties including the [[Communist Party of China]] (in 1946). Although it had no formal connection with the Taiwanese Communist Party suppressed by Japanese authorities in the 1930s (which was instead affiliated with the Communist Party of Japan), the Taiwan branch of the Communist Party of China absorbed many former members of the Taiwanese Communist Party. However, against the backdrop of the [[Chinese Civil War]] which erupted soon after the retrocession of Taiwan, the Kuomintang-controlled Republic of China government attempted to restrict the operation of Communist Party of China cells in Taiwan, and other opposition parties. \n\n=== Taiwan after 1949 ===\nWith the Republic of China government rapidly losing the Chinese civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]], the ruling [[Kuomintang]] began preparing to move the government to Taiwan in 1949. Taiwan was placed under [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] from 19 May 1949 to 15 July 1987. The Taiwan provincial branch of the Communist Party of China was particularly targeted, and by 1952 had been completely destroyed.\n\nDuring this time, all forms of [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] were forbidden by the government, only three political parties who retreated to [[Taiwan]] were allowed to participate the elections.\n* [[Kuomintang]] ({{zh|t=\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8 |p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 Gu\u00f3m\u00ednd\u01ceng}}; [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]: ''Tiong-kok Kok-b\u00een-t\u00f3ng''){{NoteTag|KMT's prior body was [[Revive China Society]] ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u8208\u4e2d\u6703 |p=x\u012bngzh\u014dnghu\u00ec}}), founded on 24 November 1894.

In January 1966, [[Robert Menzies]] who had been Prime Minister of Australia since 1949 retired and was replaced by [[Harold Holt]].

In January 1966, [[Robert Menzies]] who had been Prime Minister of Australia since 1949 retired and was replaced by [[Harold Holt]].
