Arecanut Palm at the Plantation.jpg|thumb|right|Arecanut plantation in [[Karnataka]]]]\nAreca nut is not a native crop of India. It is generally believed to be native to Malaysia or Philippines where it is grown in many varieties. It is a tropical crop which grows from West Indies to the East Coast of Africa, and in Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka and Malaya.{{Sfn|Pramank|2004|p=44}}<ref name=Over/> The practice of chewing the areca nuts is attributed to Vietnam and Malaysia. It was from Southeast Asia that the crop spread to Asia and India where it is cultivated as a cash crop.

The Indian [[Ayurveda]] texts also refer to the areca nuts as a traditional medicine.<ref name=Over/>\n\nIts use in India is also noted from the pre-[[Vedha|vedic]] period and was described by the word ''taamboola'' in ancient [[Indian civilization]]. It is extensively used in  [[Hindu]] religious rites of birth, marriage, nuptial and is also offered to guests as a mark of hospitality. It is offered to gods in veneration in the form of ''taamboola'', which consists of one areca nut placed over two betel leaves.{{Sfn|Pramank|2004|p=44}}\n\nAreca nut is extensively used as a masticator in south and southeast Asian counties, chewed with or without betel leaves. However, in India it has a special ethno-religious importance.{{sfn|Tejwani|2002|p=86}}\n\n==Varieties==\nIn India there are two varieties of areca nut, also called ''[[supari]]'' in [[Hindi language]]. One is the white variety and the other is the red variety. The white areca nut is produced by harvesting the fully ripe nuts and then subjecting it to sun drying for about 2 months. In the red variety the green areca nut is harvested, boiled and then its exterior husk is removed.Sometimes Arecanut is even grounded in the soil for fermentation purpose to enhance the taste preferably called as \"Mojha Tamul\" in Assam.<ref name=Over/>\n\n==Production==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 0.4em 1em\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\" colspan=4|Top 10 Areca nut Producing States in India (2013\u201314)\n|-\n!Rank\n!State\n!Area ('000 ha)\n!Production ('000 tonnes)\n|-\n| 1 || [[Karnataka]] || 218.01 ||457.56\n|-\n| 2 || [[Kerala]] || 100.01 || 100.02\n|-\n| 3 || [[Assam]] || 68.04 || 89.00\n|-\n| 4 || [[Meghalaya]] || 17.11 || 24.68\n|-\n| 5 || [[West Bengal]] || 11.39|| 21.16\n|-\n| 6 || [[Mizoram]] || 10.14|| 6.05\n|-\n| 7 || [[Tamil Nadu]] || 6.7 || 8.62\n|-\n| 8 || [[Tripura]] || 4.7|| 9.92\n|-\n| 9 || [[Andaman & Nicobar Islands]] || 4.23|| 5.88\n|-\n| 10 || [[Maharashtra]] || 2.2|| 3.58\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n|-\n|colspan=5 | ''Source: [http://dasd.gov.in/images/kerala/pdf_files/ARECANUT_-_AREA_PRODUCTION_AND_PRODUCITIVTY_IN_INDIA.pdf]\n|}\n\n[[File:Mysore Areca Nut \u0d2e\u0d48\u0d38\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d05\u0d1f\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 \u0d2a\u0d34\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d \u0d24\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d24\u0d4d.JPG|right|thumb|Areca Nut in [[Mysore]], [[Karnataka]].]]\n[[File:Areca-nut-top.JPG|right|thumb|Areca nut stem, sheaths and fruit bunches]]\n[[File:Palm Fruit I IMG 2100.jpg|right|thumb|The areca nut fruit]]\nIn 1990\u201391 the area under areca nut plantation was {{Convert|208400| ha}} and production was 249,300 tonnes.{{sfn|Tejwani|2002|p=84}} During 2013\u201314 its production was 729,810 tonnes from an area of {{Convert|445000| ha}}.

But its yield at higher elevations is not economical. Extreme climatic conditions, particularity of temperature, are not suitable for its growth; it thrives in areas with temperature range of {{Convert|14|-|36|C}}. It also grows in areas in Kerala and West Bengal where the temperature varies from a minimum of {{Convert|4| C}} to a maximum of {{Convert|40| C}}.

Areca nut farming, to achieve good yield, needs large application of organic manures and chemical fertilizers.{{Sfn|Giriappa|1994|p=13}}\n\nThe gestation period for the areca nut tree to yield fruits varies from four to eight years. Its life span is up to 60 years and in some cases even 100 years. [[Pollination]] takes place due to the effect of wind. The tree bears small creamy white flowers which have a strong scent. The fruit grows to a ripening stage in about 8 months. The tree bears bunches of fruits which are plucked manually.<ref name=Over/>\n\nThe type of diseases affecting the areca nut plant are: bud-rot, ''mahali'' (fruit-rot), yellow leaf disease, which need to be tackled by chemical spraying.{{Sfn|Giriappa|1994|p=13}}\n\nIrrigation is an essential requirement (once a week) along with the land drainage throughout the year.

The fat, which is extracted by using organic solvents, is made up of mastic acid and its byproducts. The fat is mixed in a certain proportion with [[cocoa butter]] or [[coconut oil]], which is then used to make confectioneries and duplicate dairy products.{{sfn|Tejwani|2002|p=84}}\n\nThe polyphenol (tannins) content varies from 38 to 47% in tender nuts and 15 to 22% in ripe nuts. Tannin, which is extracted from the nut, is used in foods as natural colouring agent, and also in the leather industry. Other minor constituents in the areca nut alkaloids, in terms of the total weight of the nut, is about 1.6%, which are comprise [[arecoline]], [[arecolodine]], [[arecaidine]], [[guvacine]], [[isoguvacine]], and [[govacolidine]]; the pharmacological and other uses of these alkaloids are as \"antihelminithic, ophthalmic, antibacterial, antidiabetic.\"{{sfn|Tejwani|2002|p=89}} \n\nAreca nut husk is used to make many industrial products such as [[hardboard]], [[insulation wool]], cushions, paper, paper board and [[activated carbon]]. The chemical composition of the areca husk consists of 18.75% [[furfural|furaldehyde]] which when distilled produces 5.5% [[furfural]]; it also yields [[xylitol]].{{sfn|Tejwani|2002|p=89}}\n\nAreca leaf sheaths are used to make ply-boards. Other miscellaneous uses of leaf sheath are to make caps, eating bowls, vessels to keep [[palm wine]], and artifacts.{{sfn|Tejwani|2002|p=89}} \n\nIn the past, plantation farmers practiced inter-cropping to make themselves safe economically, as the gestation period of the areca nut plant before it started yielding nuts was very long.

However, with improvements in management practices, with better marketing facilities and good infrastructure and cooperatives, inter cropping is less practiced.{{sfn|Tejwani|2002|p=89}}\n\nAreca nut cultivation is carried out according to farm management practices after studying different cost concepts.
