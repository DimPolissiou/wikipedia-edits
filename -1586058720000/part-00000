{"title_page": "Solar eclipse of November 13, 2012", "text_new": "{{Infobox solar eclipse|2012Nov13}}\nA total [[solar eclipse]] took place on 13\u201314 November 2012 ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). Because it crossed the [[International Date Line]] it began in [[Time zone|local time]] on November 14 west of the date line over northern [[Australia]], and ended in local time on November 13 east of the date line near the west coast of [[South America]]. Its greatest [[magnitude of eclipse|magnitude]] was 1.0500, occurring only 12 hours before [[perigee]] (Perigee on 2012 Nov 14 at 10:11:48 UTC), with greatest eclipse totality lasting just over four minutes. A [[solar eclipse]] occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's [[apparent diameter]] is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.\n\nIt was the 45th eclipse of the 133rd [[Saros cycle]], which began with a partial eclipse on July 13, 1219 and will conclude with a partial eclipse on September 5, 2499.\n\n== The tables below contain detailed predictions and additional information on the Total Solar Eclipse of 13 November 2012. ==\n\n=== Eclipse Characteristics ===\n\nEclipse Magnitude = 1.05004\n\nEclipse Obscuration = 1.10259\n\nGamma = -0.37189\n\nSaros Series = [[Solar Saros 133|133rd]] (45 of 72)\n\n=== Conjunction Times ===\n\nGreatest Eclipse = 13 Nov 2012 22:11:48.2 UTC (22:12:55.2 TD)\n\nEcliptic Conjunction = 13 Nov 2012 22:07:59.9 UTC (22:09:06.9 TD)\n\nEquatorial Conjunction = 13 Nov 2012 22:18:04.7 UTC (22:19:11.7 TD)\n\n=== Geocentric Coordinates of Sun and Moon ===\n\nSun right ascension = 15 hours, 18 minutes, 6.7 seconds\n\nMoon right ascension = 15 hours, 17 minutes, 51.2 seconds\n\nEarth's shadow right ascension = 3 hours, 18 minutes, 6.7 seconds\n\nSun declination = 18 degrees, 15 minutes, 2.6 seconds south of Celestial Equator\n\nMoon declination = 18 degrees, 37 minutes, 29.5 seconds south of Celestial Equator\n\nEarth's shadow declination = 18 degrees, 15 minutes, 2.6 seconds north of Celestial Equator\n\nSun diameter = 1939.8 arcseconds\n\nMoon diameter = 2004.8 arcseconds\n\n=== Geocentric Libration of Moon ===\n\nLatitude: 1.0 degrees south\n\nLongitude: 0.5 degrees east\n\nDirection: 16.5 (NNE)\n\n== Visibility ==\n[[File:SolarEclipse2012Nov13T.GIF|left]]\nFor this eclipse, totality was visible from northern Australia to about 4\u00b0 north of the Chilean [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]] in the southern Pacific Ocean where totality ended.

Users can change the viewing angle, select and watch one of the available animations (defined in the 3D file) or adjust either of the 3 light sources. The light setup can be saved as \"themes\" and applied to other 3D objects quickly. The app also features four \"Quick Animations\".

It played a major role in the evolution and growth of Indian journalism and made a striking contribution to creating and nurturing the [[Indian Independence Movement|Indian freedom struggle]]. In 1920, [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russian Communist revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] described ''ABP'' as the best nationalist paper in India.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n''ABP'' was born as a Bengali weekly in February 1868 in the village of Amrita Bazaar in Jessore district (now located in modern-day Bangladesh). It was started by the Ghosh brothers to fight the cause of peasants who were being exploited by indigo planters. Sisir Kumar Ghosh was the first editor. The ''Patrika'' operated out of a battered wooden press purchased for Rs 32.\n\nIn 1871, the ''Patrika'' moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata), due to the outbreak of plague in Amrita Bazaar. Here it functioned as a bilingual weekly, publishing news and views in English and Bengali. Its anti-government views and vast influence among the people was a thorn in the flesh of the government. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the Viceroy of India promulgated the Vernacular Press Act on 1878 mainly against ABP.\n\nThe ''Patrika'' became a daily in 1891. It was the first Indian-owned English daily to go into investigative journalism. During the tenure of [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], a ''Patrika'' journalist rummaged through the waste paper basket of the Viceroy's office and pieced together a torn up letter detailing the Viceroy's plans to annexe Kashmir. ''ABP'' published the letter on its front page, where it was read by the Maharaja of Kashmir, who immediately went to London and lobbied for his independence.\n\nSisir Kumar Ghosh also launched vigorous campaigns against restrictions on civil liberties and economic exploitation. He wanted Indians to be given important posts in the administration. Both he and his brother Motilal were deeply attached to Bal Gangadhar Tilak. When Tilak was prosecuted for sedition in 1897, they raised funds in Calcutta for his defence. They also published a scathing editorial against the judge who sentenced Tilak to 6 years of imprisonment, for 'presuming to teach true patriotism to a proved and unparalleled patriot.'\n\nThe ''Patrika'' had many brushes with [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], the Viceroy of India at the time of the Partition of Bengal (1905). It referred to him as 'Young and a little foppish, and without previous training but invested with unlimited powers.' Because of such editorials, the Press Act of 1910 was passed and a security of Rs 5,000 was demanded from ABP. Motilal Ghosh was also charged with sedition but his eloquence won the case.\n\nAfter this, the ''Patrika'' started prefacing articles criticising the British government with ridiculously exuberant professions of loyalty to the British crown. When Subhas Chandra Bose and other students were expelled from Calcutta Presidency College, the ''Patrika'' took up their case and succeeded in having them re-admitted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nEven after Motilal Ghosh's death in 1922, the ''Patrika'' kept up its nationalist spirit. Higher securities of Rs 10,000 were demanded from it during the [[Salt Satyagraha]]. Its editor Tushar Kanti Ghosh (son of Sisir Kumar Ghosh) was imprisoned. The ''Patrika'' contributed its share to the success of its freedom movement under the leadership of Gandhi and suffered for its views and actions at the hands of the British rulers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe ''Patrika'' espoused the cause of communal harmony during the [[Partition of India]]. During the great Calcutta killings of 1946, the ''Patrika'' left its editorial columns blank for three days.

Brain]] and planned to be released by [[Jaleco]] in 1993. It is a scrolling shooter with primarily horizontal movement.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n''Chimera Beast'' takes place on a planet which is described as distant and [[Earth]]-like. The planet is overrun by monsters known as ''eaters'', capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of the [[food chain]], consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player's creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet's humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, eventually make their way to Earth.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nThe chief innovation of ''Chimera Beast'' is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player's eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a venomous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use [[cancer]] as a weapon.\n\nAnother difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player's eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough to charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well.\n\n== Enemies ==\nThe enemies in ''Chimera Beast'' are mostly animals, some with equivalent Earth versions and some without. Some of the enemy creatures include [[jellyfish]], a [[lamprey]], [[clownfish]], [[clam]]s, [[flying squirrel]]s, and [[mole (animal)|mole]]s. Once the player reaches the human stage, they face war vehicles such as tanks and jets.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n''Chimera Beast'' runs on dual [[Motorola 68000|68000]] processors. Sound is provided by a Ym2151 and dual OKI-M6295 chips. Like most games of its time, it uses a standard [[JAMMA]] connector.

{"title_page": "Solar eclipse of July 28, 1851", "text_new": "{{Infobox solar eclipse|1851Jul28}}\nThe earliest scientifically useful photograph of a total [[solar eclipse]] was made by Julius Berkowski at the [[Koenigsberg Observatory|Royal Observatory in K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[Prussia]], on Monday, July 28, 1851.  It was the first correctly exposed photographic image taken during totality thereby including the Sun's [[solar corona|corona]].\n\n==Background==\nA [[solar eclipse]] occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], casting a shadow on Earth that temporarily obscures part or all of the Sun's disc.  Eclipses can occur only when all three bodies are properly aligned.  Partial eclipses, in which only a portion of the Sun's surface is obscured, are relatively common due to the width of the Moon's outer shadow, or penumbra, which may be several hundred miles wide.  Total eclipses occur when the Moon's inner shadow, or umbra, reaches the surface of the Earth, completely obscuring the Sun over a much narrower portion of the ground. If the Moon is too far away at the time of an eclipse, its umbra may not reach the Earth's surface, and only a partial eclipse will be visible.\n\nBefore the advent of modern science, solar eclipses were often viewed with superstitious dread.  However, eclipses are also of interest to science due to the various phenomena that can be observed when they occur.  The corona is normally invisible due to the brightness of the solar disc, but becomes visible from Earth during a total eclipse.  Until the twentieth century, solar eclipses provided the only opportunity for scientists to observe and study the Sun's corona.  With the development of photography during the first half of the nineteenth century, it became theoretically possible to record a still image of the Sun during a total eclipse.  A variety of processes were used for early photographs, of which the most successful was the [[Daguerreotype]].\n\n==Monday, July 28, 1851==\n[[File:Les parisiens pendant l'\u00e9clipse du 28 Juillet.jpg|thumb|left|From [[Paris]]]]\nPhotographing a rare event such as a total eclipse posed unique challenges for early photography, including the extreme contrast between the corona and the dark shadow of the Moon, as well as the unusual angle to which photographic equipment had to be oriented.
