[[Walmersley]] and [[Shuttleworth, Greater Manchester|Shuttleworth]] were given to the Lord of Bury; [[Musbury Valley|Musbury]] and [[Cowpe]] with Lench in the north were ceded to [[Blackburnshire]]. The Manor of Tottington eventually formed part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]], which in turn became part of the eventual [[Duchy of Lancaster]].

On 16 September 1904 an electric tram service was introduced running along Market Street between Bury and Tottington by [[Bury Corporation Tramways]]; in response to this competition the following year the railway introduced new rolling stock and increased the number of 'halts' on the line such as at [[Sunny Wood Halt railway station|Sunnywood]].

Directly north-west, Affetside Moor rises to a height of more than 900&nbsp;ft above sea level and further north Top of Quarlton and Holcombe Moor dominate the skyline. From elevated parts of the town Scout Moor, Harden Moor and Knowl Hill are visible to the east. The villages of Affetside, Greenmount and Hawkshaw are north of the town, with Walshaw to the south west. Until the post-war period Tottington was a ribbon development along the Bury to Blackburn road, the Kirklees Valley to the east stopped development in that direction and kept Tottington distinct from [[Brandlesholme]]. Within the Kirklees Valley there are a number of artificial mill ponds and reservoirs created during Tottington's industrial heyday. Many of these have since dried up, but the remaining examples have proven an ideal habitat for numerous species of wildfowl and bats.<ref>[http://www.slbg.org.uk/Technical%20Report%202007.pdf Bat Activity Survey over millponds in South Lancashire] South Lancashire Bat Group</ref>\n\nThe [[superficial deposits|superficial geology]] beneath Tottington consists of [[Devensian]] [[glacial till]]s, which overlie the [[Pennine Coal Measures Group|Lower Pennine Coal Measures]]; the same sequences of [[sandstones]], [[mudstones]] and [[coal seam]]s that form the [[Lancashire Coalfield]].

Directly north-west, Affetside Moor rises to a height of more than 900&nbsp;ft above sea level and further north Top of Quarlton and Holcombe Moor dominate the skyline.

The villages of Affetside, Greenmount and Hawkshaw are north of the town, with Walshaw to the south west. Until the post-war period Tottington was a ribbon development along the Bury to Blackburn road, the Kirklees Valley to the east stopped development in that direction and kept Tottington distinct from [[Brandlesholme]]. Within the Kirklees Valley there are a number of artificial mill ponds and reservoirs created during Tottington's industrial heyday. Many of these have since dried up, but the remaining examples have proven an ideal habitat for numerous species of wildfowl and bats.<ref>[http://www.slbg.org.uk/Technical%20Report%202007.pdf Bat Activity Survey over millponds in South Lancashire] South Lancashire Bat Group</ref>\n\nThe [[superficial deposits|superficial geology]] beneath Tottington consists of [[Devensian]] [[glacial till]]s, which overlie the [[Pennine Coal Measures Group|Lower Pennine Coal Measures]]; the same sequences of [[sandstones]], [[mudstones]] and [[coal seam]]s that form the [[Lancashire Coalfield]].

They wrote a constitution and by-laws, under the provisions of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) of 1934. An IRA corporation was also created.\n\nUtqia\u0121vik was incorporated as a 1st Class City under the name Barrow in 1958.\n\nResidents of the North Slope were the only Native people to vote on acceptance of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]; they rejected it. The Act was passed in December 1971 and, despite their opposition, became law. The [[Ukpea\u0121vik I\u00f1upiat Corporation]] (UIC) is the for-profit village corporation established under the Act.\n\nIn 1972, the [[North Slope Borough]] was established. With millions of dollars in new revenues from the settlement and later oil revenues, the borough has created sanitation facilities, water and electrical utilities, roads, fire departments, and health and educational services in Utqia\u0121vik and the villages of the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]].\n\nIn 1986, the North Slope Borough created the North Slope Higher Education Center.

They wrote a constitution and by-laws, under the provisions of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) of 1934. An IRA corporation was also created.\n\nUtqia\u0121vik was incorporated as a 1st Class City under the name Barrow in 1958.\n\nResidents of the North Slope were the only Native people to vote on acceptance of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]; they rejected it. The Act was passed in December 1971 and, despite their opposition, became law. The [[Ukpea\u0121vik I\u00f1upiat Corporation]] (UIC) is the for-profit village corporation established under the Act.\n\nIn 1972, the [[North Slope Borough]] was established. With millions of dollars in new revenues from the settlement and later oil revenues, the borough has created sanitation facilities, water and electrical utilities, roads, fire departments, and health and educational services in Utqia\u0121vik and the villages of the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]].\n\nIn 1986, the North Slope Borough created the North Slope Higher Education Center. Renamed [[I\u1e37isa\u0121vik College]], it is an accredited two-year college providing education based on the I\u00f1upiat culture and the needs of the North Slope Borough.\n\nThe Tuzzy Consortium Library, in the [[Inupiat Heritage Center|I\u00f1upiat Heritage Center]], serves the communities of the [[North Slope Borough]] and functions as the academic library for I\u1e37isa\u0121vik College.

This area includes [[Wiley Post-Will Rogers Memorial Airport]], [[Barrow High School]], [[North Slope Borough School District]], [[Fred Ipalook Elementary School]], as well as restaurants, hotels, the police station, the Utqia\u0121vik City Hall, a [[Wells Fargo]] bank, and numerous houses.\n{{Anchor|Browerville}}\n* The Central section is the largest of the three, and is called Browerville. This has traditionally been a residential area for the City of Utqia\u0121vik, but in recent years many businesses have opened or moved to this area.  Browerville is separated from the south section by a series of lagoons, with two connecting dirt roads. This area, in addition to the houses, includes [[Tuzzy Consortium Library]], the US Post Office, [[Eben Hopson Middle School]], [[Samuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital]], the [[I\u00f1upiat Heritage Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/inup/index.htm |title=I\u00f1upiat Heritage Center |publisher=US National Park Service |date=January 5, 2015 |accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref> two grocery stores, one hotel and two restaurants.\n* The north section is the smallest and most isolated of the three sections, known to the residents as NARL because it was originally the site of the Naval Arctic Research Lab. It is connected to the central section only by Stevenson Street, a two-lane dirt road. The NARL facility was transferred by the federal government to the North Slope Borough, which adapted it for use as [[I\u1e37isa\u0121vik College]].

He was the youngest of the five [[Marx Brothers]] and also the last to die.  He appeared in the first five Marx Brothers feature films, from 1929 to 1933, but then left the act to start his second career as an engineer and theatrical agent.\n\n==Early life==\nZeppo was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]], on February 25, 1901. His parents were [[Sam Marx]] (called \"Frenchie\" throughout his life), and his wife, [[Minnie Marx|Minnie Sch\u00f6nberg Marx]]. Minnie's brother was [[Al Shean]], who later gained fame as half of the vaudeville team [[Gallagher and Shean]]. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from [[East Frisia]] in [[Germany]]; and his father was a native of [[France]], and worked as a tailor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm|title=La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers|website=Judaisme.sdv.fr|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Zeppo's ex-wife [[Barbara Sinatra]] repeated this in her 2011 book, ''Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank''. His brother [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] offered a different account in his 1961 autobiography, ''Harpo Speaks!,'' claiming (p.&nbsp;130) that there was a popular trained chimpanzee named Mr. Zippo, and that \"Herbie\" was tagged with the name \"Zippo\" because he liked to do chinups and acrobatics, as the chimp did in its act. The youngest brother objected to this nickname, and it was altered to \"Zeppo\". Another version of this story was that his name\nwas changed to \"Zeppo\" in honor of the then popular \"Zepplin\". In a much later TV interview, Zeppo said that Zep is Italian-American slang for baby and as Zeppo was the youngest or baby Marx Brother, he was called Zeppo (BBC Archives).\n\n==Career==\nZeppo replaced brother Gummo in the Marx Brothers' stage act when the latter joined the army in 1918. Zeppo remained with the team and appeared in their successes in [[vaudeville]], on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and the first five Marx Brothers films, as a [[straight man]] and romantic lead, before leaving the team. According to a 1925 newspaper article, he also made a solo appearance in the [[Adolphe Menjou]] comedy ''[[A Kiss in the Dark (1925 film)|A Kiss in the Dark]]''. According to newspaper reviews, he appeared in a minor role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/kiss.htm|title=Marxology - A Kiss In The Dark - The Marx Brothers|website=Marx-brothers.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Lady Blue Eyes'', Barbara Sinatra, Zeppo's second wife, reported that Zeppo was considered too young to perform with his brothers, and when [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]] joined the Army, Zeppo was asked to join the act as a last-minute stand-in at a show in Texas. Zeppo was supposed to go out that night with a Jewish friend of his. They were supposed to take out two Irish girls, but Zeppo had to cancel to board the train to Texas. His friend went ahead and went on the date, and was shot a few hours later when he was attacked by an Irish gang that disapproved of a Jew dating an Irish girl.\n\nAs the youngest and having grown up watching his brothers, Zeppo could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. Groucho suffered from appendicitis during the Broadway run of ''[[Animal Crackers (theatre)|Animal Crackers]]'' and Zeppo filled in for him as Captain Spaulding.\n\n[[File:Time Magazine Cover Marx Brothers.jpg|left|thumb|Zeppo Marx (far right) with his brothers on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] in 1932]]\n\"He was so good as Captain Spaulding  in ''Animal Crackers'' that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience\", Groucho recalled.<ref>Marx, Arthur. ''My Life with Groucho: Growing Up with the Marx Brothers''. Barricade Books (June 1992)</ref> However, a comic persona of his own that could stand up against those of his brothers did not emerge. As critic Percy Hammond wrote, sympathetically, in 1928:\n\n<blockquote>One of the handicaps to the thorough enjoyment of the Marx Brothers in their merry escapades is the plight of poor Zeppo Marx. While Groucho, Harpo, and Chico are hogging the show, as the phrase has it, their brother hides in an insignificant role, peeping out now and then to listen to plaudits in which he has no share.<ref>''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19281118&id=5W8bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=80oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1522,4029042&hl=fr The Theater : Poor Zeppo Marx !]'', ''The Pittsburgh Press'', November 18, 1928.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough Zeppo continued to play it straight in the Brothers' movies for [[Paramount Pictures]], he occasionally got to be part of classic comedy moments in them\u2014in particular, his role in the famous dictation scene with Groucho in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930). He also played a pivotal role as the love interest of [[Ruth Hall (actress)|Ruth Hall]]'s character in [[Monkey Business (1931 film)|''Monkey Business'']] (1931) and of [[Thelma Todd]]'s in ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932).\n\nThe popular assumption that Zeppo's character was superfluous was fueled in part by Groucho. According to Groucho's own story, when the group became the Three Marx Brothers, the studio wanted to trim their collective salary, and Groucho replied, \"We're twice as funny without Zeppo!\"<ref name=\"britannica\">[http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ ''Duck Soup''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105232835/http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ |date=January 5, 2009}} \u2013 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. Groucho later said of his brother: \"Except for the chorus girls, being a straight man in the Marx Brothers wasn't fun for him. He wanted to be a comedian, too, but there just wasn't room for another funny Marx Brother. ... But offstage, he was the funniest one of us\".</ref>\n\nZeppo had great mechanical skills and was largely responsible for keeping the Marx family car running. He later owned a company that machined parts for the war effort during [[World War II]], Marman Products Co. of Inglewood, California, later known as the Aeroquip Company.

On September 18, 1959, Marx married [[Barbara Blakeley]], whose son, Bobby Oliver, he wanted to adopt and give his surname, but Bobby's father would not allow it. Bobby simply started using the last name \"Marx\".\n\nBlakeley wrote in her book, ''Lady Blue Eyes'', that Zeppo never made her convert to Judaism. Blakeley was of Methodist faith and said that Zeppo told her she became Jewish by \"injection\".\n\nBlakeley also wrote in her book that Zeppo wanted to keep her son out of the picture, adding a room for him onto his estate, which was more of a guest house, as it was separated from the main residence. It was also decided that Blakeley's son would go to military school, which according to Blakeley, pleased Zeppo.\n\nZeppo owned a house on Halper Lake Drive in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], which was built off the fairway of the Tamarisk Country Club. The Tamarisk Club had been set up by the Jewish community, which rivaled the gentile club called The Thunderbird. His neighbor happened to be [[Frank Sinatra]]. Zeppo later attended the Hillcrest Country Club with friends such as Sinatra, [[George Burns]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Sid Caesar]], and [[Milton Berle]].\n\nBlakeley became involved with the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], and had arranged to show ''[[Spartacus]]'' (featuring [[Kirk Douglas]]) for charity, selling tickets, and organizing a postscreening ball. At the last minute, Blakeley was told she could not have the film, so Zeppo went to the country club and spoke to Sinatra, who agreed to let him have an early release of a film he had just finished named ''[[Come Blow Your Horn (film)|Come Blow Your Horn]]''. Sinatra also flew everyone involved to Palm Springs for the event.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nZeppo was a very jealous and possessive husband, and hated for Blakeley to talk to other men. Blakeley claimed that Zeppo grabbed [[Victor Rothschild]] by the throat at a country club because she was talking to him. Blakeley had caught Zeppo on many occasions with other women; the biggest incident was a party Zeppo had thrown on his yacht. After the incident, Zeppo took Blakeley to Europe, and accepted more invitations to parties when they arrived back in the States. Some of these parties were at Sinatra's compound; he often invited Blakeley and Zeppo to his house two or three times a week. Sinatra would also send champagne or wine to their home, as a nice gesture.\n\nBlakeley and Sinatra began a love affair, unbeknownst to Zeppo. The press eventually got wind of the affair, snapping photos of Blakely and Sinatra together, or asking Blakeley questions whenever they spotted her. Both  Sinatra and she denied the affair.\n\nZeppo and Blakeley divorced in 1973. Zeppo let Blakeley keep the 1969 Jaguar he had bought her, and agreed to pay her $1,500 ({{Inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) per month for 10 years. Sinatra upgraded Blakeley's Jaguar to the latest model. Sinatra also gave her a house to live in.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The house had belonged to [[Eden Hartford]], Groucho Marx's third wife. Blakeley and Sinatra continued to date, and were constantly hounded by the press until the divorce between Zeppo and Blakeley became final. Blakeley and Sinatra were married in 1976.\n\nZeppo became ill with cancer in 1978. He sold his home, and moved to a house on the fairway off Frank Sinatra Drive. The doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission, but it returned. Zeppo called Blakeley, who accompanied him to doctor's appointments. Zeppo spent his last days with Blakeley's family.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Death==\nThe last surviving Marx Brother, Zeppo died of [[lung cancer]] at the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] in Rancho Mirage on November 30, 1979, at the age of 78.

Both Sinatra and Blakeley attended his funeral.\n\n==Legacy==\nZeppo introduced [[Jack Benny]] to his wife [[Mary Livingstone]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSeveral critics have challenged the notion that Zeppo did not develop a comic persona in his films. [[James Agee]] considered Zeppo \"a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man\".<ref>Joe Adamson. ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973.</ref> Along similar lines, [[Gerald Mast]], in his book ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', noted that Zeppo's comedic persona, while certainly more subtle than his brothers', was undeniably present:\n\n<blockquote>[He] added a fourth dimension as the clich\u00e9 of the [romantic] juvenile, the bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of the sound stage. ... [He is] too schleppy, too nasal, and too wooden to be taken seriously.<ref>Mast, Gerald. ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', pp. 282, 285. University of Chicago Press, 1979.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile this interpretation of Zeppo's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the Paramount pictures, more astute film reviewers were apparently in on the joke as far back as the release of ''The Cocoanuts'' in 1929. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the movie, for example, ranked all four Marx Brothers equally \u2014 \"When the ''four'' Marx brothers are on the screen, it's a riot\" [emphasis added] \u2014 and went on to describe each of the brothers' unique style of comedy, and praised Zeppo as \"the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand.\"<ref>''Cinema Year by Year, 1894\u20132001''. London: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2001, p. 205.</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Hello, I Must be Going: Groucho & His Friends'', [[Charlotte Chandler]] defended Zeppo as being \"the Marx Brothers' interpreter in the worlds they invaded. He was neither totally a straight man nor totally a comedian, but combined elements of both, as did [[Margaret Dumont]]. Zeppo's importance to the Marx Brothers' initial success was as a Marx Brother who could 'pass' as a normal person. None of Zeppo's replacements ([[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], [[Kenny Baker (American singer and actor)|Kenny Baker]] and others) could assume this character as convincingly as Zeppo, because they were actors, and Zeppo was the real thing, cast to type\" (562).\n\nZeppo's comic persona was further highlighted in the \"dictation scene\" of ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''. In his book ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Sometimes Zeppo'', [[Joe Adamson]] analyzed the scene, showing how it revealed Zeppo's ability to one-up Groucho with simple, plain-English rebuttals. In the scene, Groucho dictates a letter to his lawyer, which Zeppo takes down. Adamson noted,\n\n<blockquote>There is a common assumption that Zeppo = Zero, which this scene does its best to contradict. Groucho dictating a letter to anybody else would hardly be cause for rejoicing. We have to believe that someone will be there to accept all his absurdities and even respond somewhat in kind before things can progress free from conflict into this genial mishmash. Groucho clears his throat in the midst of his dictation, and Zeppo asks him if he wants that in the letter. Groucho says, 'No, put it in the envelope.' Zeppo nods. And only Zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and the salutation and leaving out the letter because it didn't sound important to him. It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx Brother and get away with it.<ref name=\"Adamson\">Joe Adamson, ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A History of the Marx Brothers and a Satire on the Rest of the World'', Simon & Schuster, Paperback (1983).</ref>{{rp|114}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the same book, Adamson noted Zeppo's position as the campy parody of the juvenile romantic in his analysis of ''[[Horse Feathers]]''. This tongue-in-cheek observation bolstered the theory of Zeppo's stiffness as a deliberate comic persona:\n\n<blockquote>Each Marx Brother has his own form of comedy. Zeppo is at his funniest when he opens his mouth and sings. It has taken forty years, of course, for the full humor to come across. For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but for a Marx Brother it's immortality. Almost every crooner of 1932 looks stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in the first place, the effect crosses the threshold into lovable comedy. \"I think you're wonderful!\" he oozes charmingly to [[Thelma Todd]], and we ''know'' he never met her before shooting started.<ref name=\"Adamson\"/>{{rp|191}}</blockquote>\n\nCritic Dan\u00e9l Griffin, who praises Zeppo as \"that great comic parody of the schleppy juvenile role of the 1920s/30s musicals,\u201d believes that the onscreen dynamic between Groucho and Zeppo is one of the \u201ckey relationships between the individual Marx Brothers [that] shape their comedic strategy, not counting when the four of them are onstage together.\u201d Griffin points out that Zeppo is often the brother who puts ideas into Groucho's head that set up storylines and big laughs; he goes on to explain,\n\n<blockquote>Zeppo\u2019s onscreen relationship with Groucho has always been tricky to ascertain; Zeppo is generally Groucho\u2019s aloof secretary in their films, but he is seemingly capable of reducing Groucho to stunned silence with simple, plain-English rebuttals (see ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'') when Chico\u2019s snappy comebacks only fuel Groucho\u2019s insults all the more. \u2026  Zeppo\u2019s parts are usually small, but he performs exactly what is required of him as an outwardly wooden fellow who is incapable of being rattled by a man whose business is to rattle.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Griffin  | first = Dan\u00e9l  | title = ''Duck Soup'' review  | work = \"Film as Art\"  | publisher = [[University of Alaska Southeast]]  | url = http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121203234711/http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 2012-12-03  | accessdate = 2019-06-08  }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAllen W. Ellis wrote in his article \"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\":\n\n<blockquote>Indeed, Zeppo is a link between the audience and Groucho, Harpo and Chico. In a sense, he ''is'' us on the screen. He knows who those guys are and what they are capable of. As he ambles out of a scene, perhaps it is to watch them do their business, to come back in as necessary to move the film along, and again to join in the celebration of the finish. Further, Zeppo is crucial to the absurdity of the Paramount films. The humor is in his incongruity. Typically he dresses like a normal person, in stark contrast to Groucho's greasepaint and 'formal' attire, Harpo's rags, and Chico's immigrant hand-me-downs. By most accounts, he is the handsomest of the brothers, yet that handsomeness is distorted by his familial resemblance to the others\u2014sure, he's handsome, but it is a decidedly peculiar, Marxian handsomeness. By making the group four, Zeppo adds [[symmetry]], and in the [[surrealism|surrealistic]] worlds of the Paramount films, this symmetry upsets rather than confirms balance: it is [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] born of symmetry. That he is a plank in a maelstrom, along with the very concept of 'this guy' who is there for no real reason, who joins in and is accepted by these other three wildmen while the [[narrative]] offers no explanation, are wonderful in their pure absurdity. 'To string things together in a seemingly purposeless way,' said [[Mark Twain]], 'and to be seemingly unaware that they are absurd, is the mark of American humor.' The 'sense' injected into the nonsense only compounds the nonsense.<ref>Ellis, Allen W. \"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\" in ''The Journal of Popular Culture'', Vol. 37, No. 1, 2003, pp. 21-22.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a eulogy for Zeppo written in 1979 for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', columnist Tom Zito wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Thank goodness for Zeppo, who never really cracked a joke on screen. At least not directly. He just took it from Groucho, in more ways than one. ... If Groucho, Chico and Harpo were the funny guys, Zeppo was the [[Everyman]], the loser who'd come running out of the grocery store only to find the meter maid sticking the parking ticket on his Hungadunga.<ref>Tom Zito, \"The Last of the Marxes\", ''The Washington Post'': December 1, 1979.</ref></blockquote>\n\nZeppo's performances produced this tribute from a prominent fan, written in [[Marc Eliot (author)|Marc Eliot]]'s 2005 [[biography]] of [[Cary Grant]]. Grant, a teenager performing in vaudeville under his real name, Archie Leach, loved the Marx Brothers. And as Eliot put it,\n\n<blockquote>While the rest of the country preferred Groucho, Zeppo, the good-looking straight man and romantic lead, was Archie's favorite, the one whose foil timing he believed was the real key to the act's success. Not long after, Archie began to augment his already well-practiced \u201csuave\u201d Fairbanks look and dress with a Zeppo-like fancy [[bowtie]] (called a jazz-bow, or jazzbo, during the Roaring Twenties) and copied his brilliantine hairstyle, adding Dixie Peach, a favorite pomade of American black performers and show business leads, by the palmful to his thick dark mop, to give it a molded, comb-streaked blue-black Zeppo sheen. <ref>Eliot, Marc. ''Cary Grant: The Biography''. New York: Aurum Press (2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his book ''The Anarchy of the Imagination: Interviews, Essays, Notes'', noted filmmaker [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] included Zeppo on his list for the ten greatest film actors of all time.<ref>Fassbinder, R.

The object of the Marxes' comedy is anarchy, but its subject is fraternity: they are in it together to the end.

His brother [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] offered a different account in his 1961 autobiography, ''Harpo Speaks!,'' claiming (p.&nbsp;130) that there was a popular trained chimpanzee named Mr. Zippo, and that \"Herbie\" was tagged with the name \"Zippo\" because he liked to do chinups and acrobatics, as the chimp did in its act. The youngest brother objected to this nickname, and it was altered to \"Zeppo\". Another version of this story was that his name\nwas changed to \"Zeppo\" in honor of the then popular \"Zepplin\". In a much later TV interview, Zeppo said that Zep is Italian-American slang for baby and as Zeppo was the youngest or baby Marx Brother, he was called Zeppo (BBC Archives).\n\n==Career==\nZeppo replaced brother Gummo in the Marx Brothers' stage act when the latter joined the army in 1918. Zeppo remained with the team and appeared in their successes in [[vaudeville]], on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and the first five Marx Brothers films, as a [[straight man]] and romantic lead, before leaving the team. According to a 1925 newspaper article, he also made a solo appearance in the [[Adolphe Menjou]] comedy ''[[A Kiss in the Dark (1925 film)|A Kiss in the Dark]]''. According to newspaper reviews, he appeared in a minor role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/kiss.htm|title=Marxology - A Kiss In The Dark - The Marx Brothers|website=Marx-brothers.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Lady Blue Eyes'', Barbara Sinatra, Zeppo's second wife, reported that Zeppo was considered too young to perform with his brothers, and when [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]] joined the Army, Zeppo was asked to join the act as a last-minute stand-in at a show in Texas. Zeppo was supposed to go out that night with a Jewish friend of his. They were supposed to take out two Irish girls, but Zeppo had to cancel to board the train to Texas. His friend went ahead and went on the date, and was shot a few hours later when he was attacked by an Irish gang that disapproved of a Jew dating an Irish girl.\n\nAs the youngest and having grown up watching his brothers, Zeppo could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. Groucho suffered from appendicitis during the Broadway run of ''[[Animal Crackers (theatre)|Animal Crackers]]'' and Zeppo filled in for him as Captain Spaulding.\n\n[[File:Time Magazine Cover Marx Brothers.jpg|left|thumb|Zeppo Marx (far right) with his brothers on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] in 1932]]\n\"He was so good as Captain Spaulding  in ''Animal Crackers'' that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience\", Groucho recalled.<ref>Marx, Arthur. ''My Life with Groucho: Growing Up with the Marx Brothers''. Barricade Books (June 1992)</ref> However, a comic persona of his own that could stand up against those of his brothers did not emerge. As critic Percy Hammond wrote, sympathetically, in 1928:\n\n<blockquote>One of the handicaps to the thorough enjoyment of the Marx Brothers in their merry escapades is the plight of poor Zeppo Marx. While Groucho, Harpo, and Chico are hogging the show, as the phrase has it, their brother hides in an insignificant role, peeping out now and then to listen to plaudits in which he has no share.<ref>''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19281118&id=5W8bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=80oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1522,4029042&hl=fr The Theater : Poor Zeppo Marx !]'', ''The Pittsburgh Press'', November 18, 1928.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough Zeppo continued to play it straight in the Brothers' movies for [[Paramount Pictures]], he occasionally got to be part of classic comedy moments in them\u2014in particular, his role in the famous dictation scene with Groucho in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930). He also played a pivotal role as the love interest of [[Ruth Hall (actress)|Ruth Hall]]'s character in [[Monkey Business (1931 film)|''Monkey Business'']] (1931) and of [[Thelma Todd]]'s in ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932).\n\nThe popular assumption that Zeppo's character was superfluous was fueled in part by Groucho. According to Groucho's own story, when the group became the Three Marx Brothers, the studio wanted to trim their collective salary, and Groucho replied, \"We're twice as funny without Zeppo!\"<ref name=\"britannica\">[http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ ''Duck Soup''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105232835/http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ |date=January 5, 2009}} \u2013 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. Groucho later said of his brother: \"Except for the chorus girls, being a straight man in the Marx Brothers wasn't fun for him. He wanted to be a comedian, too, but there just wasn't room for another funny Marx Brother. ... But offstage, he was the funniest one of us\".</ref>\n\nZeppo had great mechanical skills and was largely responsible for keeping the Marx family car running. He later owned a company that machined parts for the war effort during [[World War II]], Marman Products Co. of Inglewood, California, later known as the Aeroquip Company. This company produced a motorcycle, called the [[Marman Twin]],<ref name=\"Marman Twin\">[http://www.50sville.com/marman.html Marman Twin \u2013 Herbert Zeppo Marx \u2013 Marx Brothers<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717185038/http://www.50sville.com/marman.html |date=July 17, 2014}}</ref> and the [[Marman clamp]]s used to hold the \"[[Fat Man]]\" [[atomic bomb]] inside the [[B-29 bomber]] ''[[Bockscar]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He invented and obtained several patents for a wristwatch that monitored the pulse rate of cardiac patients and gave off an alarm if the heartbeat became irregular,<ref>US Patent and Trademark Office; US Pat. 3,473,526; \"Cardiac Pulse-Rate Monitor\", filed July 14, 1967 & issued October 21, 1969; 3,426,747, \"Method and Watch Mechanism for Actuation by a Cardiac Pulse\", a continuation-in-part filed November 20, 1967, issued February 11, 1969.</ref> and a therapeutic pad for delivering moist heat to a patient.<ref>US PTO; U.S. Pat. 2,590,026; inventor Zeppo Marx; \"Vapor Delivery Pad for Distributing Moist Heat\", filed June 14, 1950, issued March 18, 1952.</ref>\n\nHe also founded a large theatrical agency with his brother Gummo.

On September 18, 1959, Marx married [[Barbara Blakeley]], whose son, Bobby Oliver, he wanted to adopt and give his surname, but Bobby's father would not allow it. Bobby simply started using the last name \"Marx\".\n\nBlakeley wrote in her book, ''Lady Blue Eyes'', that Zeppo never made her convert to Judaism. Blakeley was of Methodist faith and said that Zeppo told her she became Jewish by \"injection\".\n\nBlakeley also wrote in her book that Zeppo wanted to keep her son out of the picture, adding a room for him onto his estate, which was more of a guest house, as it was separated from the main residence. It was also decided that Blakeley's son would go to military school, which according to Blakeley, pleased Zeppo.\n\nZeppo owned a house on Halper Lake Drive in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], which was built off the fairway of the Tamarisk Country Club. The Tamarisk Club had been set up by the Jewish community, which rivaled the gentile club called The Thunderbird. His neighbor happened to be [[Frank Sinatra]]. Zeppo later attended the Hillcrest Country Club with friends such as Sinatra, [[George Burns]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Sid Caesar]], and [[Milton Berle]].\n\nBlakeley became involved with the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], and had arranged to show ''[[Spartacus]]'' (featuring [[Kirk Douglas]]) for charity, selling tickets, and organizing a postscreening ball. At the last minute, Blakeley was told she could not have the film, so Zeppo went to the country club and spoke to Sinatra, who agreed to let him have an early release of a film he had just finished named ''[[Come Blow Your Horn (film)|Come Blow Your Horn]]''. Sinatra also flew everyone involved to Palm Springs for the event.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nZeppo was a very jealous and possessive husband, and hated for Blakeley to talk to other men. Blakeley claimed that Zeppo grabbed [[Victor Rothschild]] by the throat at a country club because she was talking to him. Blakeley had caught Zeppo on many occasions with other women; the biggest incident was a party Zeppo had thrown on his yacht. After the incident, Zeppo took Blakeley to Europe, and accepted more invitations to parties when they arrived back in the States. Some of these parties were at Sinatra's compound; he often invited Blakeley and Zeppo to his house two or three times a week. Sinatra would also send champagne or wine to their home, as a nice gesture.\n\nBlakeley and Sinatra began a love affair, unbeknownst to Zeppo. The press eventually got wind of the affair, snapping photos of Blakely and Sinatra together, or asking Blakeley questions whenever they spotted her. Both  Sinatra and she denied the affair.\n\nZeppo and Blakeley divorced in 1973. Zeppo let Blakeley keep the 1969 Jaguar he had bought her, and agreed to pay her $1,500 ({{Inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) per month for 10 years. Sinatra upgraded Blakeley's Jaguar to the latest model. Sinatra also gave her a house to live in.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The house had belonged to [[Eden Hartford]], Groucho Marx's third wife. Blakeley and Sinatra continued to date, and were constantly hounded by the press until the divorce between Zeppo and Blakeley became final. Blakeley and Sinatra were married in 1976.\n\nZeppo became ill with cancer in 1978. He sold his home, and moved to a house on the fairway off Frank Sinatra Drive. The doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission, but it returned. Zeppo called Blakeley, who accompanied him to doctor's appointments. Zeppo spent his last days with Blakeley's family.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Death==\nThe last surviving Marx Brother, Zeppo died of [[lung cancer]] at the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] in Rancho Mirage on November 30, 1979, at the age of 78. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news|title=Zeppo Marx Dies on Coast at 78; Last Survivor of Comedy Team; 'Tired of Being a Stooge'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/01/archives/zeppo-marx-dies-on-coast-at-78-last-survivor-of-comedy-team-tired.html |page=47|quote=Zeppo Marx, the surviving member of the Marx Brothers comedy team who left the quartet in 1934 for other businesses, died yesterday at Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Springs, Calif.

Both Sinatra and Blakeley attended his funeral.\n\n==Legacy==\nZeppo introduced [[Jack Benny]] to his wife [[Mary Livingstone]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSeveral critics have challenged the notion that Zeppo did not develop a comic persona in his films. [[James Agee]] considered Zeppo \"a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man\".<ref>Joe Adamson. ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973.</ref> Along similar lines, [[Gerald Mast]], in his book ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', noted that Zeppo's comedic persona, while certainly more subtle than his brothers', was undeniably present:\n\n<blockquote>[He] added a fourth dimension as the clich\u00e9 of the [romantic] juvenile, the bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of the sound stage. ... [He is] too schleppy, too nasal, and too wooden to be taken seriously.<ref>Mast, Gerald. ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', pp. 282, 285. University of Chicago Press, 1979.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile this interpretation of Zeppo's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the Paramount pictures, more astute film reviewers were apparently in on the joke as far back as the release of ''The Cocoanuts'' in 1929. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the movie, for example, ranked all four Marx Brothers equally \u2014 \"When the ''four'' Marx brothers are on the screen, it's a riot\" [emphasis added] \u2014 and went on to describe each of the brothers' unique style of comedy, and praised Zeppo as \"the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand.\"<ref>''Cinema Year by Year, 1894\u20132001''. London: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2001, p. 205.</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Hello, I Must be Going: Groucho & His Friends'', [[Charlotte Chandler]] defended Zeppo as being \"the Marx Brothers' interpreter in the worlds they invaded. He was neither totally a straight man nor totally a comedian, but combined elements of both, as did [[Margaret Dumont]]. Zeppo's importance to the Marx Brothers' initial success was as a Marx Brother who could 'pass' as a normal person. None of Zeppo's replacements ([[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], [[Kenny Baker (American singer and actor)|Kenny Baker]] and others) could assume this character as convincingly as Zeppo, because they were actors, and Zeppo was the real thing, cast to type\" (562).\n\nZeppo's comic persona was further highlighted in the \"dictation scene\" of ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''. In his book ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Sometimes Zeppo'', [[Joe Adamson]] analyzed the scene, showing how it revealed Zeppo's ability to one-up Groucho with simple, plain-English rebuttals. In the scene, Groucho dictates a letter to his lawyer, which Zeppo takes down. Adamson noted,\n\n<blockquote>There is a common assumption that Zeppo = Zero, which this scene does its best to contradict. Groucho dictating a letter to anybody else would hardly be cause for rejoicing. We have to believe that someone will be there to accept all his absurdities and even respond somewhat in kind before things can progress free from conflict into this genial mishmash. Groucho clears his throat in the midst of his dictation, and Zeppo asks him if he wants that in the letter. Groucho says, 'No, put it in the envelope.' Zeppo nods. And only Zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and the salutation and leaving out the letter because it didn't sound important to him. It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx Brother and get away with it.<ref name=\"Adamson\">Joe Adamson, ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A History of the Marx Brothers and a Satire on the Rest of the World'', Simon & Schuster, Paperback (1983).</ref>{{rp|114}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the same book, Adamson noted Zeppo's position as the campy parody of the juvenile romantic in his analysis of ''[[Horse Feathers]]''. This tongue-in-cheek observation bolstered the theory of Zeppo's stiffness as a deliberate comic persona:\n\n<blockquote>Each Marx Brother has his own form of comedy. Zeppo is at his funniest when he opens his mouth and sings. It has taken forty years, of course, for the full humor to come across. For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but for a Marx Brother it's immortality. Almost every crooner of 1932 looks stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in the first place, the effect crosses the threshold into lovable comedy. \"I think you're wonderful!\" he oozes charmingly to [[Thelma Todd]], and we ''know'' he never met her before shooting started.<ref name=\"Adamson\"/>{{rp|191}}</blockquote>\n\nCritic Dan\u00e9l Griffin, who praises Zeppo as \"that great comic parody of the schleppy juvenile role of the 1920s/30s musicals,\u201d believes that the onscreen dynamic between Groucho and Zeppo is one of the \u201ckey relationships between the individual Marx Brothers [that] shape their comedic strategy, not counting when the four of them are onstage together.\u201d Griffin points out that Zeppo is often the brother who puts ideas into Groucho's head that set up storylines and big laughs; he goes on to explain,\n\n<blockquote>Zeppo\u2019s onscreen relationship with Groucho has always been tricky to ascertain; Zeppo is generally Groucho\u2019s aloof secretary in their films, but he is seemingly capable of reducing Groucho to stunned silence with simple, plain-English rebuttals (see ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'') when Chico\u2019s snappy comebacks only fuel Groucho\u2019s insults all the more. \u2026  Zeppo\u2019s parts are usually small, but he performs exactly what is required of him as an outwardly wooden fellow who is incapable of being rattled by a man whose business is to rattle.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Griffin  | first = Dan\u00e9l  | title = ''Duck Soup'' review  | work = \"Film as Art\"  | publisher = [[University of Alaska Southeast]]  | url = http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121203234711/http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 2012-12-03  | accessdate = 2019-06-08  }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAllen W. Ellis wrote in his article \"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\":\n\n<blockquote>Indeed, Zeppo is a link between the audience and Groucho, Harpo and Chico. In a sense, he ''is'' us on the screen. He knows who those guys are and what they are capable of. As he ambles out of a scene, perhaps it is to watch them do their business, to come back in as necessary to move the film along, and again to join in the celebration of the finish. Further, Zeppo is crucial to the absurdity of the Paramount films. The humor is in his incongruity. Typically he dresses like a normal person, in stark contrast to Groucho's greasepaint and 'formal' attire, Harpo's rags, and Chico's immigrant hand-me-downs. By most accounts, he is the handsomest of the brothers, yet that handsomeness is distorted by his familial resemblance to the others\u2014sure, he's handsome, but it is a decidedly peculiar, Marxian handsomeness. By making the group four, Zeppo adds [[symmetry]], and in the [[surrealism|surrealistic]] worlds of the Paramount films, this symmetry upsets rather than confirms balance: it is [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] born of symmetry. That he is a plank in a maelstrom, along with the very concept of 'this guy' who is there for no real reason, who joins in and is accepted by these other three wildmen while the [[narrative]] offers no explanation, are wonderful in their pure absurdity. 'To string things together in a seemingly purposeless way,' said [[Mark Twain]], 'and to be seemingly unaware that they are absurd, is the mark of American humor.' The 'sense' injected into the nonsense only compounds the nonsense.<ref>Ellis, Allen W. \"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\" in ''The Journal of Popular Culture'', Vol. 37, No. 1, 2003, pp. 21-22.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a eulogy for Zeppo written in 1979 for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', columnist Tom Zito wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Thank goodness for Zeppo, who never really cracked a joke on screen. At least not directly. He just took it from Groucho, in more ways than one. ... If Groucho, Chico and Harpo were the funny guys, Zeppo was the [[Everyman]], the loser who'd come running out of the grocery store only to find the meter maid sticking the parking ticket on his Hungadunga.<ref>Tom Zito, \"The Last of the Marxes\", ''The Washington Post'': December 1, 1979.</ref></blockquote>\n\nZeppo's performances produced this tribute from a prominent fan, written in [[Marc Eliot (author)|Marc Eliot]]'s 2005 [[biography]] of [[Cary Grant]]. Grant, a teenager performing in vaudeville under his real name, Archie Leach, loved the Marx Brothers. And as Eliot put it,\n\n<blockquote>While the rest of the country preferred Groucho, Zeppo, the good-looking straight man and romantic lead, was Archie's favorite, the one whose foil timing he believed was the real key to the act's success. Not long after, Archie began to augment his already well-practiced \u201csuave\u201d Fairbanks look and dress with a Zeppo-like fancy [[bowtie]] (called a jazz-bow, or jazzbo, during the Roaring Twenties) and copied his brilliantine hairstyle, adding Dixie Peach, a favorite pomade of American black performers and show business leads, by the palmful to his thick dark mop, to give it a molded, comb-streaked blue-black Zeppo sheen. <ref>Eliot, Marc. ''Cary Grant: The Biography''. New York: Aurum Press (2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his book ''The Anarchy of the Imagination: Interviews, Essays, Notes'', noted filmmaker [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] included Zeppo on his list for the ten greatest film actors of all time.<ref>Fassbinder, R. W. ''The Anarchy of the Imagination: Interviews, Essays, Notes''. The Johns Hopkins University Press (September 1, 1992).</ref>\n\nIn a June 2016 review of an Off-Broadway revival of ''[[I'll Say She Is]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[Adam Gopnik]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Matt [Walters], becoming Zeppo, is a reminder that the Marxes were never quite as good again after they lost their one straight man. The object of the Marxes' comedy is anarchy, but its subject is fraternity: they are in it together to the end. Zeppo's inclusion in the family made the others less like clowns and more like brothers.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-a-lost-marx-brothers-musical-found-its-way-back-onstage Gopnik, Adam.

The award was also on behalf of Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances.  \"I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,\" he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time).
