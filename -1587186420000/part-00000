It is a long-running company, having been formerly known as '''Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds''' for many decades; it can trace its origins back to 1759 and the birth of the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe company's name are the initials of three early figures in its history, these being [[Guest family|John Guest]], [[Arthur Keen (businessman)|Arthur Keen]], and [[Joseph Henry Nettlefold]]; all three had been key figures in the field of metalwork during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Originally known as the ''Dowlais Iron Company'', the founding company behind the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in [[Wales]], it merged with Keen's ''[[Patent Nut and Bolt Company]]'' to form ''Guest, Keen & Co. Ltd'' on 9 July 1900; two years later, the firm acquired and absorbed ''[[Nettlefolds Limited]]'', leading to its name being changed to ''Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds''. Throughout the majority of the twentieth century, steel production formed the core of GKN; however, the company increasingly branched into [[Machine tool|tooling]] and component manufacturing. It was deeply impacted by government policies during the latter half of the century, during which Britain's steel industry was subject to multiple [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]] efforts. During the 1980s, GKN Steel reduced its presence in the steel sector, selling off or shutting down its works.\n\nDuring 1986, indicating its shift away from steel production, GKN Steel renamed itself GKN. Business activities were re-orientated around the aerospace, automotive, and industrial services markets. In 1994, GKN purchased [[Westland Aircraft]]; the company later organised the latter's merger to form [[AgustaWestland]] and its sale to Italian defense firm [[Finmeccanica]]. During November 1995, [[Dana Corporation]] purchased GKN's axle group; the two firms continued to operate [[joint venture]]s in the field for many years. During the early 2000s, it took over Tochigi Fuji Sangyo K.K, a Japanese manufacturer of differentials and driveline torque systems. During December 2011, GKN Aerospace Engineering services division was sold to product engineering firm [[Quest Global]]. In 2012, GKN acquired the Swedish aerospace component specialist [[Volvo Aero]]. During 2018, [[Melrose Industries]] acquired GKN through a controversial \u00a38.1 billion deal.\n\n==History==\n\n===1759 to 1900===\n{{main|Dowlais Ironworks}}\n[[Image:George Childs Dowlais Ironworks 1840.jpg|thumbnail|250px|''Dowlais Ironworks'' by George Childs (1840)]]\nThe origins of GKN lie in the founding of the Dowlais Ironworks in the village of [[Dowlais]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Wales]], by [[Thomas Lewis (industrialist)|Thomas Lewis]] and [[Isaac Wilkinson]].

W. Cotterill Ltd. Cotterill owned a subsidiary named J. W. Garrington, which specialised in forgings; the forgings produced at the Garrington [[Darlaston]] plant, later supplemented by a large plant at [[Bromsgrove]], enabled GKN to become a major supplier of [[crankshaft]]s, connecting rods, half-shafts and numerous smaller forged components to the UK auto-industry, which had a period of massive expansion during the [[interwar period]] and beyond.<ref name=Motor196905>{{Cite magazine | authorlink =Philip Turner |first = Philip |last = Turner |title = Making the most of it Or \u2013 are you driving a GKN? |magazine=Motor| pages =58\u201360| date = 10 May 1969}}</ref>\n\n====Pressed steel wheels====\nIn 1920, GKN purchased steel company [[John Lysaght]] and their subsidiary, Joseph Sankey and Sons Ltd.<ref name=Motor196905/> After training as an engineer, Sankey founded a major tea tray producer.

By 1969, the highly automated Wellington plant was producing over 5\u00bd million wheels per year at a maximum rate of approximately 30,000 per day.<ref name=Motor196905/> The business also undertook other automotive related works, including supplying the chassis for the [[Triumph Herald]] and its derivatives.<ref name=Motor196905/> They were also at this time building the versatile GKN-developed [[FV432|GKN FV432]] armoured personnel carrier.<ref name=Motor196905/>\n\n====Nationalisation of steel====\nThe postwar government nationalised the steel industry under [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain]].

It is a long-running company, having been formerly known as '''Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds''' for many decades; it can trace its origins back to 1759 and the birth of the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe company's name are the initials of three early figures in its history, these being [[Guest family|John Guest]], [[Arthur Keen (businessman)|Arthur Keen]], and [[Joseph Henry Nettlefold]]; all three had been key figures in the field of metalwork during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Originally known as the ''Dowlais Iron Company'', the founding company behind the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in [[Wales]], it merged with Keen's ''[[Patent Nut and Bolt Company]]'' to form ''Guest, Keen & Co. Ltd'' on 9 July 1900; two years later, the firm acquired and absorbed ''[[Nettlefolds Limited]]'', leading to its name being changed to ''Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds''. Throughout the majority of the twentieth century, steel production formed the core of GKN; however, the company increasingly branched into [[Machine tool|tooling]] and component manufacturing. It was deeply impacted by government policies during the latter half of the century, during which Britain's steel industry was subject to multiple [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]] efforts. During the 1980s, GKN Steel reduced its presence in the steel sector, selling off or shutting down its works.\n\nDuring 1986, indicating its shift away from steel production, GKN Steel renamed itself GKN. Business activities were re-orientated around the aerospace, automotive, and industrial services markets. In 1994, GKN purchased [[Westland Aircraft]]; the company later organised the latter's merger to form [[AgustaWestland]] and its sale to Italian defense firm [[Finmeccanica]]. During November 1995, [[Dana Corporation]] purchased GKN's axle group; the two firms continued to operate [[joint venture]]s in the field for many years. During the early 2000s, it took over Tochigi Fuji Sangyo K.K, a Japanese manufacturer of differentials and driveline torque systems. During December 2011, GKN Aerospace Engineering services division was sold to product engineering firm [[Quest Global]]. In 2012, GKN acquired the Swedish aerospace component specialist [[Volvo Aero]]. During 2018, [[Melrose Industries]] acquired GKN through a controversial \u00a38.1 billion deal.\n\n==History==\n\n===1759 to 1900===\n{{main|Dowlais Ironworks}}\n[[Image:George Childs Dowlais Ironworks 1840.jpg|thumbnail|250px|''Dowlais Ironworks'' by George Childs (1840)]]\nThe origins of GKN lie in the founding of the Dowlais Ironworks in the village of [[Dowlais]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Wales]], by [[Thomas Lewis (industrialist)|Thomas Lewis]] and [[Isaac Wilkinson]].

By 1969, the highly automated Wellington plant was producing over 5\u00bd million wheels per year at a maximum rate of approximately 30,000 per day.<ref name=Motor196905/> The business also undertook other automotive related works, including supplying the chassis for the [[Triumph Herald]] and its derivatives.<ref name=Motor196905/> They were also at this time building the versatile GKN-developed [[FV432|GKN FV432]] armoured personnel carrier.<ref name=Motor196905/>\n\n====Nationalisation of steel====\nThe postwar government nationalised the steel industry under [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain]].

After leaving the turnpike in East Lyme, I-95 is known as the '''Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway''' and passes through [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], and [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], before exiting the state through [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]] at the [[Rhode Island]] border.\n\n==Route description==\n{{see also|Connecticut Turnpike}}\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]/[[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] town line.]]\nI-95 enters the state as the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line. The turnpike stretches for {{convert|128|mi|km}} across the state, but only the first {{convert|88|mi|km}} is signed as I-95. This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between Greenwich and New Haven, going through the cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with daily traffic volumes of around 150,000 throughout the entire {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on}} length between the New York state line and the junction with I-91 in New Haven.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Dixon |first1 = Ken |title = Commission Approves Study for I-95 Widening in SW CT |url = https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Commission-approves-study-for-I-95-widening-in-SW-10900695.php |website = Connecticut Post |accessdate = December 31, 2018 |date = February 2, 2017 }}</ref> The turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] at exit 15 in Norwalk, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] at exit 27A in Bridgeport (quickest way to I-84 from southwest CT), the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]]s at exit 38 (via the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]]) in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|Interstate 91]] at exit 48 in New Haven.\n\nNorth (east) of I-91, the rurnpike continues along the Connecticut shoreline with a smaller amount of volume. The six-lane highway is reduced to four lanes in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], intersects [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] at exit 69 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]], crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] in a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]], and continues until the interchange with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] at exit 76 near the East Lyme\u2013Waterford line. After exit 76, the turnpike continues on I-395, while I-95 continues east through New London, Groton, Stonington, and North Stonington towards the Rhode Island state line.\n\nGoing southbound, the last exit before the Connecticut Turnpike segment is exit 80 for Oil Mill Road. The first exit northbound is exit 81 for Cross Road. Just before the Cross Road exit is a weigh station. The road then enters [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] and intersects with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] at exit 82. Exit 82A northbound is for a frontage road of I-95 and has access to shopping malls. Exit 83 differs in each direction. Going southbound, exit 83 is for US 1 south, the frontage road, and the shopping malls. Going northbound, however, exit 83 is for [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]] and downtown [[New London, Connecticut|New London]].\n\nExits 84S, 84N, and 84E, only going southbound, are for Route 32, Norwich, and downtown New London. Exit 85 is northbound only and is for US 1 north as it leaves a concurrency with I-95 over the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]], which crosses the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. Exit 86 is in both directions for [[Connecticut Route 12|Route 12]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]] in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Accessible from exit 86 is the [[Groton Sub Base]]. Exit 87 is for [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]]. A mile after exit 87, exit 88 leaves for [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]] and [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]]. Just short of {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-95 enters [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]] and intersects Allyn Street at exit 89 and [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] at exit 90.

Route 2 east provides access to [[Route 78 (Rhode Island-Connecticut)|Route 78]], which leads to the beaches of southwestern [[Rhode Island]], while Route 2 west provides access to [[Foxwoods Casino]]. Exit 93 is the final exit before Rhode Island and is for [[Connecticut Route 216|Route 216]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]]. I-95 then enters Rhode Island after {{convert|111.57|mi|km}}.\n\n==History==\nInterstate 95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway&nbsp;\u2014 to ease traffic congestion on Route 1 by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the State of Connecticut agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway.  Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of\n[[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 1]] (the Turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened ca. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened ca. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]] [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the Turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south/west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned circa 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the state Department of Transportation. In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ginocchio |first = Mark |title = Local Leaders Want Access to DOT Cameras |work = [[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = July 15, 2007 |pages = A1, A6 }}</ref>  Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated \"Traffic and Weather\" Channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in [[Stratford, Connecticut]].  Seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout [[Connecticut]], which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a 100 foot (30 m) section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport, Connecticut was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over 11,900 gallons (45,000 L) of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 AM on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his Pit Bull canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n==Construction plans==\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\n===Interstate upgrades===\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018).  Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut&ndash;Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at Exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007.  A similar project between Exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010.  An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at Exit 10 to Exit 8. After that lane was added, a state Department of Transportation study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lucas |first  = Jonathan |title = I-95 Lanes Open in Time for Holidays: Project Aims to Ease Congestion in Darien |work = The Advocate |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = December 8, 2007 |pages = A1, A4 |edition = Norwalk }}</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95).

I-95 from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] is part of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], during which it passes through the major cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].  After leaving the turnpike in East Lyme, I-95 is known as the '''Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway''' and passes through [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], and [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], before exiting the state through [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]] at the [[Rhode Island]] border.\n\n==Route description==\n===Connecticut Turnpike===\n{{see also|Connecticut Turnpike}}\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]/[[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] town line.]]\nInterstate 95 enters the state as the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line. The Turnpike stretches for {{convert|128|mi|km}} across the state, but only the first {{convert|88|mi|km}} is signed as I-95. This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between Greenwich and New Haven, going through the cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with daily traffic volumes of around 150,000 throughout the entire {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on}} length between the New York state line and the junction with I-91 in New Haven.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dixon |first1=Ken |title=Commission approves study for I-95 widening in SW CT |url=https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Commission-approves-study-for-I-95-widening-in-SW-10900695.php |website=Connecticut Post |accessdate=31 December 2018 |date=2 February 2017}}</ref> The Turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] at Exit 15 in Norwalk, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] at Exit 27A in Bridgeport (quickest way to I-84 from southwest CT), the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]]s at Exit 38 (via the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]]) in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|Interstate 91]] at Exit 48 in New Haven.\n\n====Fairfield County====\n\nInterstate 95 enters Connecticut at its crossing of the [[Byram River]] into the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], where it continues southwest into [[New York (state)|New York]] as the [[Interstate 95 in New York|New England Thruway]]. Upon entering Connecticut, the highway is a six-lane freeway known as the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], despite the tolls being removed from the road in 1988. The road is paralleled by [[Metro North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] to the northwest, which also carries [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, coming to an interchange with Delevan Avenue about a half mile from the state line. The freeway continues through the affluent suburban development of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] of southwestern Fairfield County, reaching a [[weigh station]] in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and coming to an interchange with Arch Street to the south of downtown Greenwich. The road heads in the neighborhood of [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] where it has an interchange with Indian Field Road, before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the [[Mianus River]], on the [[Mianus River Bridge]]. Past the river, I-95 comes to a trumpet interchange which provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 1]] between the neighborhoods [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]].\n\nAfter this interchange, the freeway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and immediately interchanges with Harvard Avenue/West Avenue on the city's [[West Side of Stamford|West Side]].\n\nNorth (east) of I-91, the Turnpike continues along the Connecticut shoreline with a smaller amount of volume. The six-lane highway is reduced to four lanes in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] at Exit 69 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]], crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] in a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]], and continues until the interchange with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut&ndash;Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]] at Exit 76 near the East Lyme-Waterford line. After Exit 76, the Turnpike continues on I-395, while I-95 continues east through New London, Groton, Stonington, and North Stonington towards the Rhode Island state line.\n\nGoing southbound, the last exit before the Connecticut Turnpike segment is Exit 80 for Oil Mill Road. The first exit northbound is Exit 81 for Cross Road. Just before the Cross Road exit is a weigh station. The road then enters [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] and intersects with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] at Exit 82. Exit 82A northbound is for a Frontage Road of I-95 and has access to shopping malls. Exit 83 differs in each direction. Going southbound, Exit 83 is for US 1 South, the Frontage Road, and the shopping malls. Going northbound, however, Exit 83 is for [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]] and downtown [[New London, Connecticut|New London]].\n\nExits 84S, 84N, and 84E, only going southbound, are for Route 32, Norwich, and downtown New London. Exit 85 is northbound only and is for US 1 North as it leaves a concurrency with I-95 over the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]], which crosses the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. Exit 86 is in both directions for Routes\n[[Connecticut Route 12|12]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|184]] in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Accessible from Exit 86 is the [[Groton Sub Base]]. Exit 87 is for [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]], also known as the Clarence B. Sharp Memorial Highway. A mile after Exit 87, Exit 88 leaves for [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]] and [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]]. Just short of three miles (5&nbsp;km) later, I-95 enters [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]] and interchanges with Allyn Street at Exit 89 and [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] at Exit 90. [[Connecticut Route 234|Route 234]] interchanges three miles (5&nbsp;km) after Exit 90 at Exit 91. Exit 92 is for Routes [[Connecticut Route 2|2]] and [[Connecticut Route 49|49]].  Route 2 East provides access to [[Route 78 (Rhode Island-Connecticut)|Route 78]], which leads to the beaches of southwestern [[Rhode Island]], while Route 2 West provides access to [[Foxwoods Casino]]. Exit 93 is the final exit before Rhode Island and is for Routes [[Connecticut Route 216|216]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|184]]. Interstate 95 then enters Rhode Island after {{convert|111.57|mi|km}}.\n\n==History==\nInterstate 95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway&nbsp;\u2014 to ease traffic congestion on Route 1 by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the State of Connecticut agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway.  Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of\n[[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 1]] (the Turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened ca. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened ca. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]] [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the Turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south/west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned circa 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the state Department of Transportation. In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>Ginocchio, Mark, \"Local leaders want access to DOT cameras\", ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], July 15, 2007, pp 1, A6</ref>  Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated \"Traffic and Weather\" Channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in [[Stratford, Connecticut]].  Seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout [[Connecticut]], which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a 100 foot (30 m) section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport, Connecticut was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over 11,900 gallons (45,000 L) of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 AM on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his Pit Bull canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n==Construction plans==\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\n===Interstate upgrades===\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018).  Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut&ndash;Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at Exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007.  A similar project between Exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010.  An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at Exit 10 to Exit 8. After that lane was added, a state Department of Transportation study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>Lucas, Jonathan, \"I-95 lanes open in time for holidays: Project aims to ease congestion in Darien\", article in '[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], December 8, 2007, pp 1, A4, Norwalk edition</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95). All of the renovated plazas feature modernized Mobil gas stations, Alltown convenience stores, [[Dunkin Donuts]], and Subway shops. [[McDonald's]] is also available at eight of the ten plazas, while the largest plazas additionally feature [[Sbarro]], [[Panda Express]] and various other quick-service options. The last of the plazas to be rebuilt, southbound in Madison, opened in August 2015.\n\n===Mass transit upgrades===\nThese projects have been undertaken in large part to reduce traffic on the highway, which is often congested, particularly in Fairfield County:\n*New [[Fairfield Metro (Metro-North station)|train station]] near the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]/Bridgeport city line (completed in 2011, fully operational in January 2012)\n*Intermodal Transportation Center in Bridgeport (completed)\n*New [[West Haven (Metro-North station)|train station]] in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] (completed)\n*Upgrade [[overhead lines|catenary power lines]] along the New Haven Line (underway through the 2010s)\n*New [[Madison (Shore Line East station)|train station]] in [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] (completed)\n*Purchase new [[railroad car]]s and refurbish existing cars to increase capacity and reliability\n*Construct new [[Intermodal container|container]] [[barge]] ports at Bridgeport and New Haven\n*Expansion of [[Freight train|freight]] service on the New Haven Line\n*Replace outdated bridges and straighten various sections of the New Haven Line to allow higher operating speeds for [[Amtrak]] and Metro-North trains\n\n==Auxiliary routes==\n*[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]] is I-95's only auxiliary route in Connecticut, which runs from the junction with I-95 in [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] north to the Massachusetts state line where it meets [[Interstate 90]] / [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Scenic overlook==\n\nBetween exits 89 and 90 northbound is the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook.

He first earned his nickname \"Billy the Killer\" when, on September 18, 1925, the 19-year-old Miller killed his brother Joseph in a fight over a woman. Tried in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]], he was acquitted of murder on the grounds that he had suffered emotional trauma due to the death of his brother. He eventually fell into a life of crime and, in August 1930, he was arrested by police in [[Lakeside, Macomb County, Michigan|Lakeside, Michigan]], and charged with a series of bank robberies committed in Michigan and Ohio. On September 2, Miller escaped from custody while imprisoned in [[Lucas County, Ohio]], and fled to Oklahoma where he eventually joined up with [[George Birdwell]] and [[Pretty Boy Floyd]].<ref name=\"Newton\"/>\n\nOn March 9, 1931, he joined Birdwell and Floyd in a $3,000 bank robbery in [[Earlsboro, Oklahoma]]. While Miller and Floyd headed for Kansas City shortly afterwards, Birdwell choosing to remain in Oklahoma, they began dating sisters Rose Ash and Beulah Baird. At the time, Rose was married, and Beulah was dating her brother-in-law. On March 25, Miller and Floyd murdered the brothers William and Wallace Ash, and left their bodies in a car which was found on the outskirts of town days later. Meanwhile, Rose and Beulah joined the outlaws as they continued their crime spree.<ref name=\"Newton\"/>\n\nMiller and Floyd headed east, robbing a bank in [[Elliston, Kentucky]], for $2,262 on April 6 and, turning back west, raided another in [[Whitehouse, Ohio]], for $1,600 eight days later. On April 16, they were confronted by authorities when Miller was spotted by police in [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]], resulting in a shootout. Floyd attempted to come to Miller's aid, killing Patrolman Ralph Castner, but Miller was already dead by the time the battle had ended. While Floyd was able to escape back to Oklahoma, Rose Ash and Beulah Baird, the latter being wounded during the gunfight, were both arrested and charged with harboring fugitives.<ref name=\"Newton\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miller, William}}\n[[Category:1906 births]]\n[[Category:1931 deaths]]\n[[Category:American bank robbers]]\n[[Category:Depression-era gangsters]]\n[[Category:People from Ironton, Ohio]]\n[[Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox criminal\n| name   =  Billy \"The Killer\" Miller\n| image_name     = \n| image_size     = \n| image_caption  = \n| birth_date  = 1906\n| birth_place = [[Ironton, Ohio]], United States\n| death_date  = {{Death date and age|1931|4|16|1906|1|1}}\n| death_place = [[Bowling Green, Ohio]]\n| cause          = Killed in shootout with police\n| alias          = The Killer\n| charge         =\n| conviction     =\n| conviction_penalty        = \n| conviction_status         = \n| occupation     = Bank robber\n| spouse         = \n| parents        =\n| children       =\n}}\n\n'''William \"Billy the Killer\" Miller''' (1906 \u2013 April 16, 1931) was an American bank robber and [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] outlaw.

Fourth-[[Jet fighter generations|generation]] designs are heavily influenced by lessons learned from the previous generation of combat aircraft. Long-range [[air-to-air missile]]s, originally thought to make [[dogfight]]ing obsolete, proved less influential than expected, precipitating a renewed emphasis on maneuverability. Meanwhile, the growing costs of military aircraft in general and the demonstrated success of aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II]] gave rise to the popularity of [[multirole combat aircraft]] in parallel with the advances marking the so-called fourth generation.\n\nDuring the period in question, maneuverability was enhanced by [[relaxed static stability]], made possible by introduction of the [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control systems|flight control system]] (FLCS), which in turn was possible due to advances in [[digital computer]]s and system-integration techniques. Replacement of analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement as legacy [[analog computer]] systems began to be replaced by digital flight control systems in the latter half of the 1980s.<ref name=\"HM1983\"/>\n\nThe further advance of microcomputers in the 1980s and 1990s permitted rapid upgrades to the [[avionics]] over the lifetimes of these fighters, incorporating system upgrades such as [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA), digital avionics buses and [[infra-red search and track]] (IRST).\n\nDue to the dramatic enhancement of capabilities in these upgraded fighters and in new designs of the 1990s that reflected these new capabilities, the Russian Government has taken to using the designation '''4.5&nbsp;generation''' to refer to these later designs. This is intended to reflect a class of fighters that are evolutionary{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} upgrades of the 4th generation incorporating integrated avionics suites, advanced weapons efforts to make the (mostly) conventionally designed aircraft nonetheless less easily detectable and trackable as a response to advancing missile and [[radar]] technology (see [[stealth technology]]).<ref>Fulghum, David A. and Douglas Barrie [http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&id=news/aw042307p2.xml \"F-22 Tops Japan's Military Wish List\"].

This can occur at long range (beyond visual range or BVR) or short range (within visual range or WVR). At short range, the ideal position is to the rear of the enemy aircraft, where it is unable to aim or fire weapons and the hot exhaust makes a good target for [[infrared homing]] missiles. At longer [[BVR]] range, the probability of a successful missile intercept is improved by launch at high energy, kinetic (the aircraft's speed towards its target) and potential (altitude advantage). Being able to maneuver violently, and without losing energy meanwhile increases the chance of evading enemy missiles, or escape out of range of the likely return-fire.\n\nThese two scenarios have competing demands\u2014interception requires excellent linear speed, while Within Visual Range or WVR engagements require excellent turn rate, while maintaining speed, rapid acceleration, and availability of control at low speeds and high [[angle of attack]].\n\nPrior to the 1970s, a popular view in the defense community was that missiles would render WVR combat obsolete and hence maneuverability useless. Combat experience proved this untrue due to the poor quality of missiles and the recurring need to identify targets visually. Though improvements in missile technology may make that vision a reality, experience has indicated that sensors are not foolproof and that fighters will still need to be able to fight and maneuver at close ranges. So whereas the premier [[third-generation jet fighter]]s (e.g., the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]]) were designed as interceptors with only a secondary emphasis on maneuverability, interceptors have been relegated to a secondary role in the fourth generation, with a renewed emphasis on maneuverability. While the trade-offs involved in combat aircraft design are again shifting towards BVR engagement, the management of the advancing environment of numerous information flows in the modern battle-space, and low-observability, arguably at the expense of maneuvering ability in close-combat, the application of [[thrust vectoring]] provides a way to maintain it, especially at low speed.\n\nThere are two primary contributing factors to maneuverability\u2014the amount of thrust delivered by the engines, and the ability of the aircraft's control surfaces to efficiently generate aerodynamic forces, and hence alterations in the plane's direction. [[Air combat manoeuvring]] (ACM) involves a great deal of energy management. The greater energy a fighter has, the more flexibility it has to move where it wants. An aircraft with little energy is immobile, and becomes a defenseless target. Note that available thrust does not necessarily equal speed; while it does give greater acceleration, the maximum speed of an aircraft is also determined by how much drag it produces. Herein lies one important trade-off. Low-drag configurations have small, often highly swept wings that disrupt the airflow as little as possible. However, that also means they have greatly reduced ability to alter the airflow to maneuver the aircraft.\n\n[[File:F-16 Fighting Falcon.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] on a mission near Iraq in 2003]]\nThere are two rough indicators of these factors. A plane's turning ability can be roughly measured by its wing loading, defined as the mass of the aircraft divided by the area of its lifting surfaces. A highly loaded wing has little capacity to produce additional lift, and so has limited turning ability, whereas a lightly loaded wing has much greater potential lifting power. A rough measure of acceleration is a plane's [[thrust-to-weight ratio]].\n\n===Fly-by-wire===\n[[File:FA-18 inverted above an F-14.jpg|thumb|The [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] inverted above an [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] shown here is an example of fly-by-wire control.]]\n\nOne of the new innovations on fourth generation jet fighters is [[fly-by-wire]], while generation 4.5 introduced [[Active electronically scanned array]] radar.\n\nThe YF-16, eventually developed into the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]], was the world's first aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable. This technique, called \"[[relaxed static stability]]\" (RSS), was incorporated to further enhance the aircraft's performance. Most aircraft are designed with ''positive'' static stability, which induces an aircraft to return to its original [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]] following a disturbance. However, positive static stability, the tendency to remain in its current attitude, opposes the pilot's efforts to maneuver. On the other hand, an aircraft with ''negative'' static stability will, in the absence of control input, readily deviate from level and controlled flight.\n\nAn aircraft with negative static stability can therefore be made more maneuverable. At supersonic airspeed, a negatively stable aircraft can exhibit positive static stability due to aerodynamic center migration.<ref name=\"HM1983\">Hoh, Roger H. and David G. Mitchell. \"Flying Qualities of Relaxed Static Stability Aircraft - Volume I: Flying Qualities Airworthiness Assessment and Flight Testing of Augmented Aircraft.\" Federal Aviation Administration (DOT/FAA/CT-82/130-I), September 1983. pp. 11ff.</ref><ref>Aronstein and Piccirillo 1996, p. 21.</ref> To counter this tendency to depart from controlled flight\u2014and avoid the need for constant minute trimming inputs by the pilot\u2014the 4th gen aircraft has a quadruplex (four-channel) [[Aircraft flight control systems#Fly-by-wire|fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control systems|flight control system]] (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC), which is the key component of the FLCS, accepts the pilot's input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces in such a way as to produce the desired result without inducing a loss of control. The FLCC also takes thousands of measurements per second of the aircraft's attitude, and automatically makes corrections to counter deviations from the flight path that were not input by the pilot. [[coordinated flight|Coordinated turn]] is also achieved in the same way, processing thousands of instructions per second to synchronize [[aircraft principal axes|yawing and rolling]] to minimize [[slip (aerodynamic)|sideslip]] drag in turns.<ref>Greenwood, Cynthia.

By redirecting the jet exhaust, it is possible to directly translate the engine's power into directional changes more efficiently than via the plane's control surfaces. The [[Sukhoi Su-27]] was the first aircraft to publicly display thrust vectoring for pitch (called 2D TVC), making the aircraft highly maneuverable, capable of near-zero airspeed at high angles of attack without stalling, and dynamic aerobatics at low speeds like [[Pugachev's Cobra]]. The [[Thrust vectoring#Vectoring in three dimensions|three-dimensional TVC]] nozzles of the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]] are mounted 32\u00b0 outward to longitudinal engine axis (i.e. in the horizontal plane) and can be deflected \u00b115\u00b0 in the vertical plane. This produces a [[corkscrew]] effect, greatly enhancing the turning capability of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.air-attack.com/page/80/Su-30MK.html \"Air-Attack.com \u2013 Su-30MK AL-31FP engines two-dimensional thrust vectoring\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917182438/http://air-attack.com/page/80/Su-30MK.html |date=2010-09-17 }}.

This can prevent safe acceleration through the [[transonic]] regime or make it too fuel-expensive to be effective on missions. Meanwhile, maintaining supersonic speed without (periodic) afterburner use saves large quantities of fuel too, increasing the range at which an aircraft can in reality still take advantage of its full performance.\n\nAccording to the [[German Air Force]], the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] can cruise at about Mach 1.2 without afterburner.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luftwaffe.de%2Fportal%2Fa%2Fluftwaffe%2Fwaff%2Fjets%2Feuro&langpair=de%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8 \"Supercuise at about Mach 1.2\"].

The main elements of an aircraft's avionics are its communication and navigation systems, sensors (radar and IR), computers and [[Bus (computing)|data bus]], and user interface. Because they can be readily swapped out as new technologies become available, they are often upgraded over the lifetime of an aircraft. A number of F-15C Eagles, the type was first produced in 1978, have received upgrades in the 2007 such as AESA radar and [[Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System]] and will receive the 2040C Eagle upgrade to keep them in service until 2040, thanks to its large size and long airframe life.\n\nDetails about these systems are highly classified. Thus, many export aircraft have downgraded avionics, and buyers often replace them with domestically developed avionics, sometimes considered superior to the original. Examples are the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]] sold to India, the [[F-15 Eagle|F-15I]] and [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16I]] sold to Israel, and the [[F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15K]] sold to South Korea.\n\n[[File:AESA JUK AE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zhuk (radar)|Zhuk-AE]] [[Active electronically scanned array]] radar]]\nThe primary sensor for all modern fighters is [[radar]].

Later on, it was introduced to the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] and the block 60 (export) F-16 also, and will be used for future American fighters. France introduced its first indigenous AESA radar, the  [[RBE2]]-AESA built by Thales in February 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/industrie/aeronautique-defense/20121002trib000722459/le-radar-rbe2-l-arme-fatale-du-rafale-a-l-export-.html|title=Le radar RBE2, l'arme fatale du Rafale \u00e0 l'export|author=|date=|website=latribune.fr}}</ref> for use on the Rafale. The RBE2-AESA can also be retrofitted on the Mirage 2000. A European consortium GTDAR is developing an AESA [[Euroradar CAPTOR]] radar for future use on the Typhoon. Russia has an AESA radar on its MIG-35 and their newest [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] versions. For the next-generation F-22 and F-35, the U.S. will use [[low probability of intercept]] (LPI) capacity. This will spread the energy of a radar pulse over several frequencies, so as not to trip the [[radar warning receivers]] that all aircraft carry.\n[[File:OLS-for-Su-aircrafts.jpg|thumb|The OLS-30 is a combined [[IRST]]/[[laser rangefinder|LR]] device.]]\n\nIn response to the increasing American emphasis on radar-evading stealth designs, Russia turned to alternate sensors, with emphasis on [[infra-red search and track]] (IRST) sensors, first introduced on the American [[F-101 Voodoo]] and [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] fighters in the 1960s, for detection and tracking of airborne targets. These measure IR radiation from targets. As a passive sensor, it has limited range, and contains no inherent data about position and direction of targets - these must be inferred from the images captured. To offset this, IRST systems can incorporate a [[laser rangefinder]] in order to provide full [[fire-control]] solutions for cannon fire or for launching missiles. Using this method, German [[Mig-29|MiG-29]] using helmet-displayed IRST systems were able to acquire a [[missile lock]] with greater efficiency than USAF [[F-16]] in wargame exercises. IRST sensors have now become standard on Russian aircraft. With the exception of the [[F-14 Tomcat|F-14D]] (officially retired as of September 2006), no 4th-generation Western fighters carry built-in IRST sensors for air-to-air detection, though the similar [[FLIR]] is often used to acquire ground targets.\n\nHowever '4.5 generation' fighters started introducing integrated IRST systems, such as the [[Dassault Rafale]] boasting the [[Optronique secteur frontal]] integrated IRST, a feature adopted very early in its design as an \"omnirole\" fighter jet. The [[Eurofighter|Eurofighter Typhoon]] introduced the PIRATE-IRST (beginning with Tranche 1 Block 5 aircraft,<ref>[http://www.publicservice.co.uk/pdf/dmj/issue31/DMJ31%200012%20A%20Brookes%20ATL.pdf \"Eurofighter Typhoon.\"] ''publicservice.co.''

Retrieved: 3 October 2010.</ref>\n\nThe tactical implications of the computing and data bus capabilities of aircraft are hard to determine. A more sophisticated computer bus would allow more flexible uses of the existing avionics. For example, it is speculated that the F-22 is able to jam or damage enemy electronics with a focused application of its radar. A computing feature of significant tactical importance is the datalink. All modern European and American aircraft are capable of sharing targeting data with allied fighters and AWACS planes (see [[JTIDS]]). The Russian [[MiG-31]] interceptor also has some datalink capability, so it is reasonable to assume that other Russian planes can also do so. The sharing of targeting and sensor data allows pilots to put radiating, highly visible sensors further from enemy forces, while using that data to vector silent fighters toward the enemy.\n\n===Stealth technology===\n\n[[Stealth technology]] is an extension of the notion of [[aircraft camouflage]] to modern radar and [[thermography|infrared]] detection sensors. While not rendering an aircraft \"invisible\" as is popularly conceived, stealth makes an aircraft much more difficult to discern among the sky, clouds, or distant aircraft, conferring a significant tactical advantage. While the basic principles of shaping aircraft to avoid detection were known at least since the 1960s, it was not until the availability of supercomputers that shape computations could be performed from every angle, a complex task. The use of computer-aided design, combined with [[radar-absorbent material]]s, produced aircraft of drastically reduced radar cross-section ([[Radar cross-section|RCS]]) that were much more difficult to detect on radar. Meanwhile, advances in digital flight control make potentially destabilizing, or control-complicating effects of shape alterations easier to compensate for.\n[[File:Eurofighter 9803 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] uses jet inlets that conceal the front of the jet engine (a strong radar target) from radar. Many important radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept to reflect radar energy well away from the front sector.]]\nDuring the 1970s, the rudimentary level of stealth shaping (as seen in the faceted design of the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]]) resulted in too severe a performance penalty to be used on fighters. Faster computers enabled smoother designs such as the [[B-2 Spirit]], and thought was given to applying the basic ideas to decrease, if not drastically reduce, the RCS of fighter aircraft. These techniques are also combined with methods of decreasing the [[infrared signature]], visual signature, and [[acoustic signature]] of the aircraft. While fighters designated 4.5 generation under the US-devised system incorporate some low-observable features, so-called [[fifth-generation fighter]]s have more clearly been designed with this as a very high priority. The inclusion of this as a criterion for the designation of \"fifth generation\" serves to illustrate the degree to which US manufacturers and their clients appear to assign value to this capability.\n\nThere are some reports that the [[Dassault Rafale]]'s avionics, the [[Thales Spectra]], includes \"stealthy\" [[radar jamming and deception]] technology, and systems for the active cancellation of RADAR analogous to the acoustic noise suppression systems on the [[Bombardier Dash 8]]. Conventional jammers make locating an aircraft more difficult, but their operation is itself detectable, with missiles being designed more recently to endeavor to follow the jamming itself. The French system is hypothesized to interfere with detection without revealing that jamming is in operation.\n\nSuch a system ought in principle to be able to make an aircraft entirely invisible, were it to be feasible to actively mimic an undisturbed RADAR signature (canceling all reflections, and compensating for any RADAR shadow) however such a system would be incalculably difficult and is not envisaged. Meanwhile, the real effectiveness of systems that allegedly exist is unknown.\n\nResearch continues into other ways of decreasing observability by radar. There are claims that Russian researchers are working on \"[[plasma stealth]]\".<ref>http://www.aeronautics.ru/archive/research_literature/aviation_articles/Aviation%20Week/topics/plasma_stealth/index.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925000959/http://www.aeronautics.ru/archive/research_literature/aviation_articles/Aviation%20Week/topics/plasma_stealth/index.htm |date=2006-09-25 }} \"Research Articles.\" ''Venik's Aviation Data Archive.'' Retrieved: 3 October 2010.</ref>\n\nThere are in any case ways to detect fighters other than radar. For instance, passive infra-red sensors can detect the heat of engines, and even the sound of a [[sonic boom]] (which any supersonic aircraft will make) can be tracked with a network of sensors and computers. However, using these to provide precise targeting information for a long-range missile is considerably less straightforward than radar.\n\n[[IAI Lavi]] uses an [[S-duct]] air intake that prevents radar waves from reflecting off engine compressor fans, thus significantly reducing frontal RCS. This is similar to the layout on the [[YF-23]] stealth fighter.\n\n==Combat performance==\nThe F-15 and F-16 have the first and second best known overall combat records of modern jet fighters{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} \u2013 an amalgamation of the combat records of both jets in [[Israeli Air Force]] service in various conflicts, followed by both jets in [[USAF]] service during the Invasion of Iraq in 1991.

Fourth-[[Jet fighter generations|generation]] designs are heavily influenced by lessons learned from the previous generation of combat aircraft. Long-range [[air-to-air missile]]s, originally thought to make [[dogfight]]ing obsolete, proved less influential than expected, precipitating a renewed emphasis on maneuverability. Meanwhile, the growing costs of military aircraft in general and the demonstrated success of aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II]] gave rise to the popularity of [[multirole combat aircraft]] in parallel with the advances marking the so-called fourth generation.\n\nDuring the period in question, maneuverability was enhanced by [[relaxed static stability]], made possible by introduction of the [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control systems|flight control system]] (FLCS), which in turn was possible due to advances in [[digital computer]]s and system-integration techniques. Replacement of analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement as legacy [[analog computer]] systems began to be replaced by digital flight control systems in the latter half of the 1980s.<ref name=\"HM1983\"/>\n\nThe further advance of microcomputers in the 1980s and 1990s permitted rapid upgrades to the [[avionics]] over the lifetimes of these fighters, incorporating system upgrades such as [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA), digital avionics buses and [[infra-red search and track]] (IRST).\n\nDue to the dramatic enhancement of capabilities in these upgraded fighters and in new designs of the 1990s that reflected these new capabilities, the Russian Government has taken to using the designation '''4.5&nbsp;generation''' to refer to these later designs. This is intended to reflect a class of fighters that are evolutionary{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} upgrades of the 4th generation incorporating integrated avionics suites, advanced weapons efforts to make the (mostly) conventionally designed aircraft nonetheless less easily detectable and trackable as a response to advancing missile and [[radar]] technology (see [[stealth technology]]).<ref>Fulghum, David A. and Douglas Barrie [http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=awst&id=news/aw042307p2.xml \"F-22 Tops Japan's Military Wish List\"].

This can occur at long range (beyond visual range or BVR) or short range (within visual range or WVR). At short range, the ideal position is to the rear of the enemy aircraft, where it is unable to aim or fire weapons and the hot exhaust makes a good target for [[infrared homing]] missiles. At longer [[BVR]] range, the probability of a successful missile intercept is improved by launch at high energy, kinetic (the aircraft's speed towards its target) and potential (altitude advantage). Being able to maneuver violently, and without losing energy meanwhile increases the chance of evading enemy missiles, or escape out of range of the likely return-fire.\n\nThese two scenarios have competing demands\u2014interception requires excellent linear speed, while Within Visual Range or WVR engagements require excellent turn rate, while maintaining speed, rapid acceleration, and availability of control at low speeds and high [[angle of attack]].\n\nPrior to the 1970s, a popular view in the defense community was that missiles would render WVR combat obsolete and hence maneuverability useless. Combat experience proved this untrue due to the poor quality of missiles and the recurring need to identify targets visually. Though improvements in missile technology may make that vision a reality, experience has indicated that sensors are not foolproof and that fighters will still need to be able to fight and maneuver at close ranges. So whereas the premier [[third-generation jet fighter]]s (e.g., the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]]) were designed as interceptors with only a secondary emphasis on maneuverability, interceptors have been relegated to a secondary role in the fourth generation, with a renewed emphasis on maneuverability. While the trade-offs involved in combat aircraft design are again shifting towards BVR engagement, the management of the advancing environment of numerous information flows in the modern battle-space, and low-observability, arguably at the expense of maneuvering ability in close-combat, the application of [[thrust vectoring]] provides a way to maintain it, especially at low speed.\n\nThere are two primary contributing factors to maneuverability\u2014the amount of thrust delivered by the engines, and the ability of the aircraft's control surfaces to efficiently generate aerodynamic forces, and hence alterations in the plane's direction. [[Air combat manoeuvring]] (ACM) involves a great deal of energy management. The greater energy a fighter has, the more flexibility it has to move where it wants. An aircraft with little energy is immobile, and becomes a defenseless target. Note that available thrust does not necessarily equal speed; while it does give greater acceleration, the maximum speed of an aircraft is also determined by how much drag it produces. Herein lies one important trade-off. Low-drag configurations have small, often highly swept wings that disrupt the airflow as little as possible. However, that also means they have greatly reduced ability to alter the airflow to maneuver the aircraft.\n\n[[File:F-16 Fighting Falcon.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] on a mission near Iraq in 2003]]\nThere are two rough indicators of these factors. A plane's turning ability can be roughly measured by its wing loading, defined as the mass of the aircraft divided by the area of its lifting surfaces. A highly loaded wing has little capacity to produce additional lift, and so has limited turning ability, whereas a lightly loaded wing has much greater potential lifting power. A rough measure of acceleration is a plane's [[thrust-to-weight ratio]].\n\n===Fly-by-wire===\n[[File:FA-18 inverted above an F-14.jpg|thumb|The [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] inverted above an [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] shown here is an example of fly-by-wire control.]]\n\nOne of the new innovations on fourth generation jet fighters is [[fly-by-wire]], while generation 4.5 introduced [[Active electronically scanned array]] radar.\n\nThe YF-16, eventually developed into the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]], was the world's first aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable. This technique, called \"[[relaxed static stability]]\" (RSS), was incorporated to further enhance the aircraft's performance. Most aircraft are designed with ''positive'' static stability, which induces an aircraft to return to its original [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]] following a disturbance. However, positive static stability, the tendency to remain in its current attitude, opposes the pilot's efforts to maneuver. On the other hand, an aircraft with ''negative'' static stability will, in the absence of control input, readily deviate from level and controlled flight.\n\nAn aircraft with negative static stability can therefore be made more maneuverable. At supersonic airspeed, a negatively stable aircraft can exhibit positive static stability due to aerodynamic center migration.<ref name=\"HM1983\">Hoh, Roger H. and David G.

The flight control computer (FLCC), which is the key component of the FLCS, accepts the pilot's input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces in such a way as to produce the desired result without inducing a loss of control. The FLCC also takes thousands of measurements per second of the aircraft's attitude, and automatically makes corrections to counter deviations from the flight path that were not input by the pilot. [[coordinated flight|Coordinated turn]] is also achieved in the same way, processing thousands of instructions per second to synchronize [[aircraft principal axes|yawing and rolling]] to minimize [[slip (aerodynamic)|sideslip]] drag in turns.<ref>Greenwood, Cynthia.

By redirecting the jet exhaust, it is possible to directly translate the engine's power into directional changes more efficiently than via the plane's control surfaces. The [[Sukhoi Su-27]] was the first aircraft to publicly display thrust vectoring for pitch (called 2D TVC), making the aircraft highly maneuverable, capable of near-zero airspeed at high angles of attack without stalling, and dynamic aerobatics at low speeds like [[Pugachev's Cobra]]. The [[Thrust vectoring#Vectoring in three dimensions|three-dimensional TVC]] nozzles of the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]] are mounted 32\u00b0 outward to longitudinal engine axis (i.e. in the horizontal plane) and can be deflected \u00b115\u00b0 in the vertical plane. This produces a [[corkscrew]] effect, greatly enhancing the turning capability of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.air-attack.com/page/80/Su-30MK.html \"Air-Attack.com \u2013 Su-30MK AL-31FP engines two-dimensional thrust vectoring\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917182438/http://air-attack.com/page/80/Su-30MK.html |date=2010-09-17 }}.

Meanwhile, maintaining supersonic speed without (periodic) afterburner use saves large quantities of fuel too, increasing the range at which an aircraft can in reality still take advantage of its full performance.\n\nAccording to the [[German Air Force]], the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] can cruise at about Mach 1.2 without afterburner.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luftwaffe.de%2Fportal%2Fa%2Fluftwaffe%2Fwaff%2Fjets%2Feuro&langpair=de%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8 \"Supercuise at about Mach 1.2\"].

The main elements of an aircraft's avionics are its communication and navigation systems, sensors (radar and IR), computers and [[Bus (computing)|data bus]], and user interface. Because they can be readily swapped out as new technologies become available, they are often upgraded over the lifetime of an aircraft. A number of F-15C Eagles, the type was first produced in 1978, have received upgrades in the 2007 such as AESA radar and [[Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System]] and will receive the 2040C Eagle upgrade to keep them in service until 2040, thanks to its large size and long airframe life.\n\nDetails about these systems are highly classified. Thus, many export aircraft have downgraded avionics, and buyers often replace them with domestically developed avionics, sometimes considered superior to the original. Examples are the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]] sold to India, the [[F-15 Eagle|F-15I]] and [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16I]] sold to Israel, and the [[F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15K]] sold to South Korea.\n\n[[File:AESA JUK AE.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zhuk (radar)|Zhuk-AE]] [[Active electronically scanned array]] radar]]\nThe primary sensor for all modern fighters is [[radar]].

The RBE2-AESA can also be retrofitted on the Mirage 2000. A European consortium GTDAR is developing an AESA [[Euroradar CAPTOR]] radar for future use on the Typhoon. Russia has an AESA radar on its MIG-35 and their newest [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] versions. For the next-generation F-22 and F-35, the U.S. will use [[low probability of intercept]] (LPI) capacity. This will spread the energy of a radar pulse over several frequencies, so as not to trip the [[radar warning receivers]] that all aircraft carry.\n[[File:OLS-for-Su-aircrafts.jpg|thumb|The OLS-30 is a combined [[IRST]]/[[laser rangefinder|LR]] device.]]\n\nIn response to the increasing American emphasis on radar-evading stealth designs, Russia turned to alternate sensors, with emphasis on [[infra-red search and track]] (IRST) sensors, first introduced on the American [[F-101 Voodoo]] and [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] fighters in the 1960s, for detection and tracking of airborne targets. These measure IR radiation from targets. As a passive sensor, it has limited range, and contains no inherent data about position and direction of targets - these must be inferred from the images captured. To offset this, IRST systems can incorporate a [[laser rangefinder]] in order to provide full [[fire-control]] solutions for cannon fire or for launching missiles. Using this method, German [[Mig-29|MiG-29]] using helmet-displayed IRST systems were able to acquire a [[missile lock]] with greater efficiency than USAF [[F-16]] in wargame exercises. IRST sensors have now become standard on Russian aircraft. With the exception of the [[F-14 Tomcat|F-14D]] (officially retired as of September 2006), no 4th-generation Western fighters carry built-in IRST sensors for air-to-air detection, though the similar [[FLIR]] is often used to acquire ground targets.\n\nHowever '4.5 generation' fighters started introducing integrated IRST systems, such as the [[Dassault Rafale]] boasting the [[Optronique secteur frontal]] integrated IRST, a feature adopted very early in its design as an \"omnirole\" fighter jet. The [[Eurofighter|Eurofighter Typhoon]] introduced the PIRATE-IRST (beginning with Tranche 1 Block 5 aircraft,<ref>[http://www.publicservice.co.uk/pdf/dmj/issue31/DMJ31%200012%20A%20Brookes%20ATL.pdf \"Eurofighter Typhoon.\"] ''publicservice.co.''

Retrieved: 3 October 2010.</ref>\n\nThe tactical implications of the computing and data bus capabilities of aircraft are hard to determine. A more sophisticated computer bus would allow more flexible uses of the existing avionics. For example, it is speculated that the F-22 is able to jam or damage enemy electronics with a focused application of its radar. A computing feature of significant tactical importance is the datalink. All modern European and American aircraft are capable of sharing targeting data with allied fighters and AWACS planes (see [[JTIDS]]). The Russian [[MiG-31]] interceptor also has some datalink capability, so it is reasonable to assume that other Russian planes can also do so. The sharing of targeting and sensor data allows pilots to put radiating, highly visible sensors further from enemy forces, while using that data to vector silent fighters toward the enemy.\n\n===Stealth technology===\n\n[[Stealth technology]] is an extension of the notion of [[aircraft camouflage]] to modern radar and [[thermography|infrared]] detection sensors. While not rendering an aircraft \"invisible\" as is popularly conceived, stealth makes an aircraft much more difficult to discern among the sky, clouds, or distant aircraft, conferring a significant tactical advantage. While the basic principles of shaping aircraft to avoid detection were known at least since the 1960s, it was not until the availability of supercomputers that shape computations could be performed from every angle, a complex task. The use of computer-aided design, combined with [[radar-absorbent material]]s, produced aircraft of drastically reduced radar cross-section ([[Radar cross-section|RCS]]) that were much more difficult to detect on radar. Meanwhile, advances in digital flight control make potentially destabilizing, or control-complicating effects of shape alterations easier to compensate for.\n[[File:Eurofighter 9803 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] uses jet inlets that conceal the front of the jet engine (a strong radar target) from radar. Many important radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin leading edges, are highly swept to reflect radar energy well away from the front sector.]]\nDuring the 1970s, the rudimentary level of stealth shaping (as seen in the faceted design of the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]]) resulted in too severe a performance penalty to be used on fighters. Faster computers enabled smoother designs such as the [[B-2 Spirit]], and thought was given to applying the basic ideas to decrease, if not drastically reduce, the RCS of fighter aircraft. These techniques are also combined with methods of decreasing the [[infrared signature]], visual signature, and [[acoustic signature]] of the aircraft. While fighters designated 4.5 generation under the US-devised system incorporate some low-observable features, so-called [[fifth-generation fighter]]s have more clearly been designed with this as a very high priority. The inclusion of this as a criterion for the designation of \"fifth generation\" serves to illustrate the degree to which US manufacturers and their clients appear to assign value to this capability.\n\nThere are some reports that the [[Dassault Rafale]]'s avionics, the [[Thales Spectra]], includes \"stealthy\" [[radar jamming and deception]] technology, and systems for the active cancellation of RADAR analogous to the acoustic noise suppression systems on the [[Bombardier Dash 8]]. Conventional jammers make locating an aircraft more difficult, but their operation is itself detectable, with missiles being designed more recently to endeavor to follow the jamming itself. The French system is hypothesized to interfere with detection without revealing that jamming is in operation.\n\nSuch a system ought in principle to be able to make an aircraft entirely invisible, were it to be feasible to actively mimic an undisturbed RADAR signature (canceling all reflections, and compensating for any RADAR shadow) however such a system would be incalculably difficult and is not envisaged. Meanwhile, the real effectiveness of systems that allegedly exist is unknown.\n\nResearch continues into other ways of decreasing observability by radar. There are claims that Russian researchers are working on \"[[plasma stealth]]\".<ref>http://www.aeronautics.ru/archive/research_literature/aviation_articles/Aviation%20Week/topics/plasma_stealth/index.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925000959/http://www.aeronautics.ru/archive/research_literature/aviation_articles/Aviation%20Week/topics/plasma_stealth/index.htm |date=2006-09-25 }} \"Research Articles.\" ''Venik's Aviation Data Archive.''

For instance, passive infra-red sensors can detect the heat of engines, and even the sound of a [[sonic boom]] (which any supersonic aircraft will make) can be tracked with a network of sensors and computers. However, using these to provide precise targeting information for a long-range missile is considerably less straightforward than radar.\n\n[[IAI Lavi]] uses an [[S-duct]] air intake that prevents radar waves from reflecting off engine compressor fans, thus significantly reducing frontal RCS. This is similar to the layout on the [[YF-23]] stealth fighter.\n\n==Combat performance==\nThe F-15 and F-16 have the first and second best known overall combat records of modern jet fighters{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} \u2013 an amalgamation of the combat records of both jets in [[Israeli Air Force]] service in various conflicts, followed by both jets in [[USAF]] service during the Invasion of Iraq in 1991.

Depending on the activity for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, audio, graphics and a combination of these elements. Some application packages focus on a single task, such as word processing; others, called [[integrated software]] include several applications.<ref>Ceruzzi, Paul E. (2000). ''A History of Modern Computing''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-03255-4}}.</ref>\n\n[[End-user development|User-written software]] tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software includes spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, audio, graphics, and animation scripts. Even [[Email filtering|email filters]] are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.\n\nThe delineation between system software such as [[operating system]]s and application software is not exact, however, and is occasionally the object of controversy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulrich|first1=William|title=Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality|url=https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871|publisher=Cutter Consortium}}</ref>  For example, one of the key questions in the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' [[antitrust]] trial was whether Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]] [[web browser]] was part of its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system or a separable piece of application software.  As another example, the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]] is, in part, due to disagreement about the relationship between the [[Linux kernel]] and the operating systems built over this [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]]. In some types of [[embedded system]]s, the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable to the user, as in the case of software used to control a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], [[DVD]] player or [[microwave oven]]. The above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations. For an alternative definition of an app: '' see [[Application portfolio management#Definition of an application|Application Portfolio Management]].''\n\n===Metonymy===\nThe word \"application\" used as an adjective is not restricted to the \"of or pertaining to application software\" meaning.<ref>[https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871 Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality]</ref> For example, concepts such as [[application programming interface]] (API), [[application server]], [[application virtualization]], [[application lifecycle management]] and [[portable application]] apply to all computer programs alike, not just application software.\n\n===Apps and killer apps===\n{{Main|Killer application}}\n\nSome applications are available in versions for several different platforms; others only work on one and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|geography]] application ''for [[Microsoft Windows]]'', or an ''[[Android (operating system)|Android]]'' application for [[Educational software|education]], or a [[Linux gaming|''Linux'' game]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one [[Computing platform|platform]], increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]] or ''killer app''. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern [[spreadsheet]] software for the Apple II and helped selling the then-new [[personal computer]]s into offices. For Blackberry it was their [[email]] software.\n\nIn recent years, the shortened term \"app\" (coined in 1981 or earlier<ref>[http://www.osnews.com/story/24882/The_History_of_App_and_the_Demise_of_the_Programmer The History of 'App' and the Demise of the Programmer]</ref>) has become popular to refer to [[Mobile app|applications for mobile devices]] such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]], the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on PCs. Even more recently, the shortened version is used for desktop application software as well.\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are many different and alternative ways in order to classify  [[application software]].\n\nBy the legal point of view, application software is mainly classified with a [[black box|black box approach]], in relation to the rights of its final [[end-users]] or [[subscribers]] (with eventual intermediate and tiered subscription levels).\n\n[[Software testing|Software]] applications are also classified in respect of the programming language in which the source code is written or executed, and respect of their purpose and outputs.\n\n=== By property and use rights ===\nApplication software is usually distinguished among two main classes: closed source vs [[open source software]] applications, and among [[free software|free]] or [[proprietary software]] applications.\n\nProprietary software is placed under the exclusive copyright, and a [[software license]] grants limited usage rights. The [[open-closed principle]] states that software may be \"open only for extension, but not for modification\". Such applications can only get [[Plug-in (computing)|add-on]] by third-parties.\n\n[[Free and open-source software]] shall be run, distributed, sold or extended for any purpose, and -being open- shall be modified or [[reverse engineering|reversed]] in the same way.\n\nFOSS software applications released under a [[free license]] may be [[List of countries' copyright lengths|perpetual]] and also [[royalty-free]]. Perhaps, the [[ownership|owner]], the [[holder (law)|holder]] or third-party [[law enforcer|enforcer]] of any right ([[copyright]], [[trademark]], [[patent]], or ''[[ius in re|ius in re aliena]]'') are entitled to add exceptions, limitations, time decays or expiring dates to the license terms of use.\n\n[[Public-domain software]] is a type of [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]], which is royalty-free and - openly or reservedly- can be run, distributed, modified, reversed, republished or created in derivative works without any [[attribution (copyright)|copyright attribution]] and therefore [[revocation]]. It can even be sold, but without transferring the public domain property to other single subjects. Public-domain SW can be released under an (un)licens\ning legal statement, which enforces those terms and conditions for an indefinite duration (for a lifetime, or forever).\n\n=== By coding language ===\nSince the development and near-universal adoption of the [[World Wide Web|web]], an important distinction that has emerged, has been between [[web application]]s &mdash; written with [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]] and other web-native technologies and typically requiring one to be online and running a [[web browser]], and the more traditional native applications written in whatever languages are available for one's particular [[Types of computers|type of computer]]. There has been a contentious debate in the computing community regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes, especially on mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s. Web apps have indeed greatly increased in popularity for some uses, but the advantages of applications make them unlikely to disappear soon, if ever. Furthermore, the two can be complementary, and even integrated.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jean-Louis |last=Gass\u00e9e |title=The Silly Web vs. Native Apps Debate |date=2012-09-17 |url=http://www.thisurlisfalse.com/the-silly-web-vs-native-apps-debate/ |work=The Silly Web vs. Native Apps Debate |accessdate=2013-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415200141/http://www.thisurlisfalse.com/the-silly-web-vs-native-apps-debate/ |archivedate=2016-04-15 }}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite news | first = Casey | last = Frechette | title = What journalists need to know about the difference between Web apps and native apps | date = 2013-04-11 | url = https://www.poynter.org/news/what-journalists-need-know-about-difference-between-web-apps-and-native-apps | work = Poynter | accessdate = 2017-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Valums |title=Web apps vs desktop apps |date=2010-02-10 |url=http://valums.com/web-apps/ |work=valums.com |accessdate=2013-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402210926/http://valums.com/web-apps/ |archivedate=2013-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n=== By purpose and output ===\nApplication software can also be seen as being either [[horizontal market software|horizontal]] or [[vertical market software|vertical]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is a Horizontal Application?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-horizontal-application.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What Are Horizontal Services? |url=http://eduunix.ccut.edu.cn/index2/html/java/Que.Special.Edition.Using.Enterprise.JavaBeans.2.0.internal.eBook-LiB/ch21lev1sec1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031211544/http://eduunix.ccut.edu.cn/index2/html/java/Que.Special.Edition.Using.Enterprise.JavaBeans.2.0.internal.eBook-LiB/ch21lev1sec1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-10-31 }}</ref>  Horizontal applications are more popular and widespread, because they are general purpose, for example word processors or databases. Vertical applications are [[niche product]]s, designed for a particular type of industry or business, or department within an organization. Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking worker, or accounting, or customer service.\n\nThere are many types of application software:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.educba.com/what-is-application-software-its-types/|title=What is Application Software & Its Types {{!}} eduCBA|date=2015-12-21|work=eduCBA|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LibreOffice Writer 5.1.6.2.png|thumb|[[LibreOffice Writer]], an [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[word processor]] that is a component of [[LibreOffice]] (running on [[Linux Mint]])]]\n* An ''[[application suite]]'' consists of multiple applications bundled together. They usually have related functions, features and user interfaces, and may be able to interact with each other, e.g. open each other's files. [[Business software|Business applications]] often come in suites, e.g. [[Microsoft Office]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[iWork]], which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, etc.; but suites exist for other purposes, e.g. graphics or music.\n* ''[[Enterprise software]]'' addresses the needs of an entire organization's processes and data flows, across several departments, often in a large distributed environment.  Examples include [[enterprise resource planning]] systems, [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems and [[supply chain management software]]. Departmental Software is a sub-type of enterprise software with a focus on smaller organizations or groups within a large organization. (Examples include travel [[expense management]] and IT Helpdesk.)\n* ''Enterprise infrastructure software'' provides common capabilities needed to support enterprise [[software system]]s.  (Examples include databases, email servers, and systems for managing networks and security.)\n*''[[Platform as a service|Application platform as a service (aPaaS)]]'' is a [[cloud computing]] service that offers development and deployment environments for application services.\n* ''[[Knowledge worker|Information worker]] software'' lets users create and manage information, often for individual projects within a department, in contrast to enterprise management. Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, [[Spreadsheet|spreadsheets]], email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n* ''Content access software'' is used primarily to access content without editing, but may include software that allows for content editing. Such software addresses the needs of individuals and groups to consume [[digital entertainment]] and published digital content. (Examples include [[Media player (application software)|media players]], [[web browser]]s, and help browsers.)\n* ''[[Educational software]]'' is related to content access software, but has the content or features adapted for use in by educators or students. For example, it may deliver evaluations (tests), track progress through material, or include collaborative capabilities.\n* ''[[Simulation software]]'' simulates physical or abstract systems for either research, training or entertainment purposes.\n* ''Media development software'' generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. This includes [[Graphic art software|graphic-art software]], desktop publishing software, multimedia development software, HTML editors, digital-animation editors, digital audio and video composition, and many others.<ref>Campbell-Kelly, Martin; Aspray, William (1996). ''Computer: A History of the Information Machine''. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-02990-6}}.</ref>\n* ''Product engineering software'' is used in developing hardware and software products. This includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), computer language editing and compiling tools, [[integrated development environment]]s, and application programmer interfaces.\n* ''Entertainment Software'' can refer to video games, screen savers, programs to display motion pictures or play recorded music, and other forms of entertainment which can be experienced through use of a computing device.\n\nApplications can also be classified by [[computing platform]] such as a particular [[operating system]], delivery network such as in [[cloud computing]] and [[Web 2.0]] applications, or delivery devices such as [[mobile app]]s for [[mobile device]]s.\n\nThe operating system itself can be considered application software when performing simple calculating, measuring, rendering, and word processing tasks not used to control hardware via [[command-line interface]] or [[graphical user interface]].

Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking worker, or accounting, or customer service.\n\nThere are many types of application software:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.educba.com/what-is-application-software-its-types/|title=What is Application Software & Its Types {{!}} eduCBA|date=2015-12-21|work=eduCBA|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LibreOffice Writer 5.1.6.2.png|thumb|[[LibreOffice Writer]], an [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[word processor]] that is a component of [[LibreOffice]] (running on [[Linux Mint]])]]\n* An ''[[application suite]]'' consists of multiple applications bundled together. They usually have related functions, features and user interfaces, and may be able to interact with each other, e.g. open each other's files. [[Business software|Business applications]] often come in suites, e.g. [[Microsoft Office]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[iWork]], which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, etc.; but suites exist for other purposes, e.g. graphics or music.\n* ''[[Enterprise software]]'' addresses the needs of an entire organization's processes and data flows, across several departments, often in a large distributed environment.  Examples include [[enterprise resource planning]] systems, [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems and [[supply chain management software]]. Departmental Software is a sub-type of enterprise software with a focus on smaller organizations or groups within a large organization. (Examples include travel [[expense management]] and IT Helpdesk.)\n* ''Enterprise infrastructure software'' provides common capabilities needed to support enterprise [[software system]]s.  (Examples include databases, email servers, and systems for managing networks and security.)\n*''[[Platform as a service|Application platform as a service (aPaaS)]]'' is a cloud computing service that offers development and deployment environments for application services.\n* ''[[Knowledge worker|Information worker]] software'' lets users create and manage information, often for individual projects within a department, in contrast to enterprise management. Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n* ''Content access software'' is used primarily to access content without editing, but may include software that allows for content editing. Such software addresses the needs of individuals and groups to consume [[digital entertainment]] and published digital content. (Examples include [[Media player (application software)|media players]], [[web browser]]s, and help browsers.)\n* ''[[Educational software]]'' is related to content access software, but has the content or features adapted for use in by educators or students. For example, it may deliver evaluations (tests), track progress through material, or include collaborative capabilities.\n* ''[[Simulation software]]'' simulates physical or abstract systems for either research, training or entertainment purposes.\n* ''Media development software'' generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. This includes graphic-art software, desktop publishing software, multimedia development software, HTML editors, digital-animation editors, digital audio and video composition, and many others.<ref>Campbell-Kelly, Martin; Aspray, William (1996). ''Computer: A History of the Information Machine''. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-02990-6}}.</ref>\n* ''Product engineering software'' is used in developing hardware and software products. This includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), computer language editing and compiling tools, [[integrated development environment]]s, and application programmer interfaces.\n* ''Entertainment Software'' can refer to video games, screen savers, programs to display motion pictures or play recorded music, and other forms of entertainment which can be experienced through use of a computing device.\n\nApplications can also be classified by [[computing platform]] such as a particular [[operating system]], delivery network such as in [[cloud computing]] and [[Web 2.0]] applications, or delivery devices such as [[mobile app]]s for [[mobile device]]s.\n\nThe operating system itself can be considered application software when performing simple calculating, measuring, rendering, and word processing tasks not used to control hardware via [[command-line interface]] or [[graphical user interface]]. This does not include application software bundled within operating systems such as a [[software calculator]] or [[text editor]].\n\n=== Information worker software ===\n* [[Accounting software]]\n* Data management\n** [[Contact manager]]\n** [[Spreadsheet]]\n** [[Database software]]\n* Documentation\n** [[Document automation]]\n** [[Word processor]]\n** [[Desktop publishing software]]\n** Diagramming software\n** [[Presentation software]]\n** [[Email]]\n** Blog software\n* [[Enterprise resource planning]]\n* [[:Category:Financial software|Financial software]]\n** [[Day trading software]]\n** [[Banking software]]\n** [[Clearing (finance)|Clearing systems]]\n** Arithmetic software\n* [[Field service management]]\n**[[Workforce management#Workforce management software|Workforce management software]]\n* [[Project management software]]\n** [[Calendaring software]]\n** [[Employee scheduling software]]\n** [[Workflow software]]\n* [[Reservation systems]]\n\n=== Entertainment software ===\n* [[Screen saver]]s\n* [[Video game]]s\n** [[Arcade game]]s\n** [[Console game]]s\n** [[Mobile game]]s\n** [[Personal computer game]]s\n* [[Software art]]\n** [[Demo (computer programming)|Demo]]\n*** [[64K intro]]\n\n=== Educational software ===\n{{main|List of educational software}}\n\n* Classroom management\n* [[Reference software]]\n* Sales readiness software\n* Survey management\n* Encyclopedia software\n\n=== Enterprise infrastructure software ===\n* Business [[workflow]] software\n* [[Database management system]] (DBMS)\n* [[Digital asset management]] (DAM) software\n* [[Document management]] software\n* [[Geographic information system]] (GIS)\n\n=== Simulation software ===\n* [[Computer simulator]]s\n** [[Computational science|Scientific simulator]]s\n** [[Social simulator]]s\n** [[Military simulation|Battlefield simulator]]s\n** Emergency simulators\n** Vehicle simulators\n*** [[Flight simulator]]s\n*** [[Driving simulator]]s\n** [[Simulation game]]s\n*** [[Vehicle simulation game]]s\n\n=== Media development software ===\n* [[3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[Animation software]]\n* [[Graphic art software]]\n** [[Raster graphics editor]]\n** [[Vector graphics editor]]\n* [[Image organizer]]\n* [[Video editing software]]\n* [[Audio editing software]]\n** [[Digital audio workstation]]\n* [[Music sequencer]]\n** [[Scorewriter]]\n* [[HTML editor]]\n* [[Game development tool]]\n\n=== Product engineering software ===\n* [[Engineering|Hardware engineering]]\n** [[Computer-aided engineering]]\n** [[Computer-aided design|Computer-aided design (CAD)]]\n** [[Computer-aided manufacturing|Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)]]\n** [[Finite element analysis]]\n\n=== [[Software engineering]]===\n* [[Compiler|Compiler software]]\n* [[Integrated development environment]]\n** [[Compiler]]\n** [[Linker (computing)|Linker]]\n** [[Debugger]]\n* [[Version control]]\n* [[Game development tool]]\n* [[License manager]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Software development]]\n* [[Mobile app]]\n* [[Web application]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{Wikiversity-inline}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Application software| ]]\n", "name_user": "Namah Softech Pvt Ltd.", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding Some links for some Keyword In This page (Minor changes). after this edit user can easily understand the keyword.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"}
