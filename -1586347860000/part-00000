Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the [[Methodist Church]], and four colleges (including Trinity College). [[William Preston Few]], the president of Trinity at the time, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the \"Trinity\" name. At first, James B. Duke thought the name change would come off as self-serving, but eventually, he accepted Few's proposal as a memorial to his father.<ref name=\"king\" /> Money from the endowment allowed the University to grow quickly.

With the relocation of the college in 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed \"on an equal footing with men\" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the Board of Trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, fifty-four women were enrolled in the college.

[[William Preston Few]], the president of Trinity at the time, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the \"Trinity\" name.

With the relocation of the college in 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed \"on an equal footing with men\" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the Board of Trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, fifty-four women were enrolled in the college.

Chafe says \"protective socialization by blacks themselves\" was created inside the community in order to accommodate white-imposed sanctions while subtly encouraging challenges to those sanctions. Known as \"walking the tightrope,\" such efforts at bringing about change were only slightly effective before the 1920s.\n\nHowever, this did build the foundation for later generations to advance racial equality and de-segregation. Chafe argued that the places essential for change to begin were institutions, particularly black churches, which functioned as centres for community-building and discussion of politics. Additionally, some all-black communities, such as Mound Bayou, Mississippi and Ruthville, Virginia served as sources of pride and inspiration for black society as a whole. Over time, pushback and open defiance of the oppressive existing laws grew, until it reached a boiling point in the aggressive, large-scale activism of the 1950s civil rights movement.<ref>William H.

Finally ACC schools--typically under pressure from boosters and civil rights groups--integrated their teams.<ref> Charles H.

Civil rights protests and actions, together with legal challenges, resulted in a series of legislative and court decisions which contributed to undermining the Jim Crow system.<ref name=\"vcu\">{{cite web|title=Jim Crow Laws and Racial Segregation|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/jim-crow-laws-and-racial-segregation/|website=VCU Libraries Social Welfare History Project|publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===End of legal segregation===\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|President Johnson signs the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]]]\n\nThe decisive action ending segregation came when Congress in bipartisan fashion overcame Southern filibusters to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].  A complex interaction of factors came together unexpectedly in the period 1954\u20131965 to make the momentous changes possible. The Supreme Court had taken the first initiative in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954) making segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Enforcement was rapid in the North and border states, but  was deliberately stopped in the South by the movement called [[Massive Resistance]], sponsored by rural segregationists who largely controlled the state legislatures. Southern liberals, who counseled moderation, where shouted down by both sides and have limited impact. Much more significant was the [[Civil Rights Movement]], especially the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) headed by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. It largely displaced the old, much more moderate NAACP in taking leadership roles. King organize massive demonstrations, that seized massive media attention in an era when network television news was an innovative and universally watched phenomenon. <ref>Graham Allison, [https://www.amazon.com/Framing-South-Hollywood-Television-Struggle/dp/0801866154/   ''Framing the South: Hollywood, television, and race during the Civil Rights Struggle''  (2001).]</ref>  SCLC, student activists and smaller local organizations staged demonstrations across the South.  National  attention focused on Birmingham, Alabama, where protesters deliberately provoked [[Bull Connor]] and his police forces by using young teenagers as demonstrators \u2013 and Connor arrested  900 on one day alone. The next day Connor unleashed billy clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure water hoses to disperse and punish the young demonstrators with a brutality that horrified the nation. It was very bad for business, and for the image of a modernizing progressive urban South. President John F. Kennedy, who had been calling for moderation, threatened to use federal troops to restore order in Birmingham. The result in Birmingham was  compromise by which the new mayor opened the library, golf courses, and other city facilities to both races, against the backdrop of church bombings and assassinations. <ref>Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'' (2001) [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743217729 online free to borrow]</ref> In summer 1963, there were 800 demonstrations in 200 southern cities and towns, with over 100,000 participants, and 15,000 arrests. In Alabama  in June 1963 Governor [[George Wallace]] escalated the crisis by defying  court orders to admit the first two  black students to the University of Alabama. <ref>Dan T. Carter,''The politics of rage: George Wallace, the origins of the new conservatism, and the transformation of American politics'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref> Kennedy responded by sending Congress a comprehensive civil rights bill, and ordered Attorney General Robert Kennedy to file federal lawsuits against segregated schools, and to deny funds for discriminatory programs. Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August, 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators  in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation's history. The Kennedy administration now gave full-fledged support to the civil rights movement, but powerful southern congressman blocked any legislation. <ref>Robert E. Gilbert, \"John F.

Johnson formed a coalition with Northern Republicans that led to passage in the House, and with the help of Republican Senate leader [[Everett Dirksen]] with passage in the Senate early in 1964. For the first time in history, the southern filibuster was broken and The Senate finally passed its version on June 19 by vote of 73 to 27. <ref>Garth E.

Johnson and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 63.1 (1997): 1-19.</ref> The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most powerful affirmation of equal rights ever made by Congress. It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits does desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the [[Civil Rights Commission]]; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore, racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the very last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1964, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner [[Lester Maddox]] in Georgia-- he became governor, but the great majority of restaurants and hotels in Georgia follow the new law as the business community realized That peaceful integration was the only way forward. <ref>Dewey W.

In some areas of the Deep South, white resistance made these efforts almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of the three voting-rights activists in Mississippi in 1964 and the state's refusal to prosecute the murderers, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism against blacks, had gained national attention. Finally, the [[Selma to Montgomery marches#First Selma-to-Montgomery March|unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965]], by county and state troopers on peaceful Alabama marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] en route from Selma to the state capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights enforcement legislation. President Johnson issued a call for a strong voting rights law and hearings soon began on the bill that would become the Voting Rights Act.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm \"Introduction To Federal Voting Rights Laws\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304111738/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm |date=March 4, 2007 }}. United States Department of Justice.</ref>\n\nThe [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] ended legally sanctioned state barriers to voting for all federal, state and local elections. It also provided for federal oversight and monitoring of counties with historically low minority voter turnout. Years of enforcement have been needed to overcome resistance, and additional legal challenges have been made in the courts to ensure the ability of voters to elect candidates of their choice. For instance, many cities and counties introduced [[at-large]] election of council members, which resulted in many cases of diluting minority votes and preventing election of minority-supported candidates.<ref> Patterson, '' Brown v.

Because opportunities were so limited in the South, African Americans moved in great numbers to cities in Northeastern, Midwestern, and Western states to seek better lives.\n\nDespite the hardship and prejudice of the Jim Crow era, several black entertainers and literary figures gained broad popularity with white audiences in the early 20th century. They included luminaries such as tap dancers [[Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson]] and the [[Nicholas Brothers]], jazz musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Count Basie]], and the actress [[Hattie McDaniel]]. In 1939 McDaniel was the first black person to receive an [[Academy Award]] when she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] Oscar for her performance as Mammy in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Hilary |date=2016-02-27 |title=Oscars: A Look Back at the African-American Winners \n|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/african-american-oscar-winner-oscarssowhite-870533  |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nAfrican-American athletes faced much discrimination during the Jim Crow period. White opposition led to their exclusion from most organized sporting competitions. The boxers [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Joe Louis]] (both of whom became [[world heavyweight boxing championship|world heavyweight boxing champions]]) and track and field athlete [[Jesse Owens]] (who won four gold medals at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin) earned fame during this era. In baseball, a [[baseball color line|color line]] instituted in the 1880s had informally barred blacks from playing in the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]], leading to the development of the [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]], which featured many fine players. A major breakthrough occurred in 1947, when [[Jackie Robinson]] was hired as the first African American to play in Major League Baseball; he permanently broke the color bar. Baseball teams continued to integrate in the following years, leading to the full participation of black baseball players in the Major Leagues in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Later court cases ===\n\nIn 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court (the [[Burger Court]]), in ''[[Swann v.

Louisiana law distinguished between \"white\", \"black\" and \"colored\" (that is, people of mixed European and African ancestry). The law had already specified that blacks could not ride with white people, but colored people could ride with whites before 1890. A group of concerned black, colored and white citizens in [[New Orleans]] formed an association dedicated to rescinding the law. The group persuaded [[Homer Plessy]] to test it; he was a man of color who was of fair complexion and one-eighth \"Negro\" in ancestry.<ref name=\"lou\">{{cite web|title=Plessy v.

Once he had boarded the train, he informed the train conductor of his racial lineage and took a seat in the whites-only car. He was directed to leave that car and sit instead in the \"coloreds only\" car. Plessy refused and was immediately arrested. The Citizens Committee of New Orleans fought the case all the way to the United States Supreme Court.  They lost in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), in which the Court ruled that \"separate but equal\" facilities were constitutional.  The finding contributed to 58 more years of legalized discrimination against black and colored people in the United States.<ref name=\"lou\" />\n\nIn 1908 Congress defeated an attempt to introduce segregated streetcars into the capital.<ref>Congress rejected by a majority of 140 to 59 a transport bill amendment proposed by [[James Thomas Heflin]] (Ala.) to introduce racially segregated streetcars to the capital's transport system.

An early 20th-century scholar suggested that allowing blacks to attend white schools would mean \"constantly subjecting them to adverse feeling and opinion\", which might lead to \"a morbid race consciousness\".<ref>Murphy, Edgar Gardner. ''The Problems of the Present South''. 1910, p. 37</ref> This perspective took anti-black sentiment for granted, because [[bigotry]] was widespread in the South after slavery became a racial [[caste]] system.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===World War II and post-war era===\n\nIn 1944, [[Associate Justice]] [[Frank Murphy]] introduced the word \"racism\" into the lexicon of U.S. Supreme Court opinions in ''[[Korematsu v.

This was the first time that \"racism\" was used in Supreme Court opinion (Murphy used it twice in a concurring opinion in ''[[Steele v Louisville & Nashville Railway Co]]'' [[Case citation|323 192]] (1944) issued that day).<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=323&invol=192 Steele v.

It next appeared in the landmark decision of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', {{ussc|388|1|1967}}.\n\nNumerous boycotts and demonstrations against segregation had occurred throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The [[NAACP]] had been engaged in a series of litigation cases since the early 20th century in efforts to combat laws that disenfranchised black voters across the South. Some of the early demonstrations achieved positive results, strengthening political activism, especially in the post-World War II years. Black veterans were impatient with social oppression after having fought for the United States and freedom across the world. In 1947 [[K. Leroy Irvis]] of [[Pittsburgh]]'s Urban League, for instance, led a demonstration against employment discrimination by the city's department stores. It was the beginning of his own influential political career.<ref name=\"pg\">{{cite web|title=Former Pa. House speaker K.

The [[Civil Rights Movement]] was energized by a number of flashpoints, including the 1946 police beating and blinding of World War II veteran [[Isaac Woodard]] while he was in U.S. Army uniform. In 1948 President [[Harry S.

Chafe says \"protective socialization by blacks themselves\" was created inside the community in order to accommodate white-imposed sanctions while subtly encouraging challenges to those sanctions. Known as \"walking the tightrope,\" such efforts at bringing about change were only slightly effective before the 1920s.\n\nHowever, this did build the foundation for later generations to advance racial equality and de-segregation. Chafe argued that the places essential for change to begin were institutions, particularly black churches, which functioned as centres for community-building and discussion of politics. Additionally, some all-black communities, such as Mound Bayou, Mississippi and Ruthville, Virginia served as sources of pride and inspiration for black society as a whole. Over time, pushback and open defiance of the oppressive existing laws grew, until it reached a boiling point in the aggressive, large-scale activism of the 1950s civil rights movement.<ref>William H.

A complex interaction of factors came together unexpectedly in the period 1954-1965 to make the momentous changes possible. The Supreme Court had taken the first initiative in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954) making segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Enforcement was rapid in the North and border states, but  was deliberately stopped in the South by the movement called [[Massive Resistance]], sponsored by rural segregationists who largely controlled the state legislatures. Southern liberals, who counseled moderation, where shouted down by both sides and have limited impact. Much more significant was the [[Civil Rights Movement]], especially the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) headed by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. It largely displaced the old, much more moderate NAACP in taking leadership roles. King organize massive demonstrations, that seized massive media attention in an era when network television news was an innovative and universally watched phenomenon. <ref>Graham Allison, [https://www.amazon.com/Framing-South-Hollywood-Television-Struggle/dp/0801866154/   ''Framing the South: Hollywood, television, and race during the Civil Rights Struggle''  (2001).]</ref>  SCLC, student activists and smaller local organizations staged demonstrations across the South.  National  attention focused on Birmingham, Alabama, where protesters deliberately provoked [[Bull Connor]] and his police forces by using young teenagers as demonstrators \u2013 and Connor arrested  900 on one day alone. The next day Connor unleashed billy clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure water hoses to disperse and punish the young demonstrators with a brutality that horrified the nation. It was very bad for business, and for the image of a modernizing progressive urban South. President John F. Kennedy, who had been calling for moderation, threatened to use federal troops to restore order in Birmingham. The result in Birmingham was  compromise by which the new mayor opened the library, golf courses, and other city facilities to both races, against the backdrop of church bombings and assassinations. <ref>Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'' (2001) [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780743217729 online free to borrow]</ref> In summer 1963, there were 800 demonstrations in 200 southern cities and towns, with over 100,000 participants, and 15,000 arrests. In Alabama  in June 1963 Governor [[George Wallace]] escalated the crisis by defying  court orders to admit the first two  black students to the University of Alabama. <ref>Dan T. Carter,''The politics of rage: George Wallace, the origins of the new conservatism, and the transformation of American politics'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref> Kennedy responded by sending Congress a comprehensive civil rights bill, and ordered Attorney General Robert Kennedy to file federal lawsuits against segregated schools, and to deny funds for discriminatory programs. Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August, 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators  in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation's history.

It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits does desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the [[Civil Rights Commission]]; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the very last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1964, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner [[Lester Maddox]] in Georgia-- he became governor, but the great majority of restaurants and hotels in Georgia follow the new law as the business community realized That peaceful integration was the only way forward. <ref>Dewey W.

In some areas of the Deep South, white resistance made these efforts almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of the three voting-rights activists in Mississippi in 1964 and the state's refusal to prosecute the murderers, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism against blacks, had gained national attention. Finally, the [[Selma to Montgomery marches#First Selma-to-Montgomery March|unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965]], by county and state troopers on peaceful Alabama marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] en route from Selma to the state capital of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights enforcement legislation.

She is fascinated by the human world above. She ventures out with her best friend [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|Flounder]] to collect human artifacts in her [[grotto]] and often goes to the surface of the ocean to visit [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], a seagull who offers inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She swims back to Atlantica and is watched by two eels named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flotsam and Jetsam|Flotsam and Jetsam]] under orders from [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]] the sea witch. Ariel ignores the warnings of her father [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], the ruler of Atlantica, and [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Sebastian|Sebastian]], a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact with humans is forbidden.\n\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder, and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the surface to watch a celebration for [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]]'s birthday on a ship. Ariel instantly falls in love with Eric. Shortly afterward, a violent storm arrives, which wrecks the ship and tosses Eric overboard. Ariel rescues him and brings him to shore. She sings to him but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find the girl who saved and sang to him; Ariel vows to find a way to join him in his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Triton confronts Ariel in her grotto and destroys the artifacts she collected with his trident. After Triton leaves, Ariel begins weeping. Flotsam and Jetsam convince her to visit Ursula.\n\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \"kiss of true love\" from Eric to remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel accepts and is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Unbeknownst to Ariel, Ursula, who harbors a secret vendetta against King Triton, plans to use her as a bargaining chip and take over the kingdom. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at Ariel's near success, Ursula disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel and marry Vanessa instead.\n\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who immediately pursues the wedding barge. While Sebastian informs Triton, Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. Through all of the commotion the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck breaks, which restores Ariel's voice back to her and breaks Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula then reveals herself and kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release. However, the deal is inviolable; Triton makes a new deal to take Ariel's place as Ursula's servant by giving up his trident in order to save his daughter. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the new ruler, but before she can use the trident, Ariel confronts Ursula and attacks her, and Eric intervenes with a harpoon and hurts Ursula. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes and causes Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. As Ariel hurries to join Eric, the enraged Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size.\n\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers over them. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. As Ursula is about to destroy Ariel with the trident, Eric steers a wrecked ship and kills Ursula by impaling her with its splintered [[bowsprit]]. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in Ursula's garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel loves Eric, Triton changes her from a mermaid into a human permanently and approves her marriage to Eric. At the wedding, Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Little Mermaid characters}}\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Princess Ariel]], the 16-year-old mermaid princess of Atlantica who is fascinated with humans, especially Prince Eric.<ref name=\"DisneyChar\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters (Third Edition)|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998|pages=344\u2013345|isbn=0-7868-6336-6}}</ref>\n:* Benson also voices Vanessa, Ursula's human alter ego\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]], a human prince saved by Ariel and is determined to find and marry her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2014|title=The-Little-Mermaid \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022533/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast|archive-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], a sea witch who stole Ariel's voice and is determined to ruin her attempts to get Eric to love her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n* [[Samuel E.

However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''Oliver & Company'' as more immediate releases.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> In 1987, songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] became involved with the writing and development of ''The Little Mermaid'' after he was asked to contribute a song to ''Oliver & Company''. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make ''The Little Mermaid'' a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Ashman and composer [[Alan Menken]], both noted for their work as the writers of the successful [[Off-Broadway]] stage musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', teamed up to compose the entire song score.

Effects animation supervisor [[Mark Dindal]] estimated that over a million bubbles were drawn for this film, in addition to the use of other processes such as [[airbrush]]ing, backlighting, superimposition, and some [[computer animation]].

Disney's next film, ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by [[Pixar]] called CAPS/ink & paint ([[Computer Animation Production System]]), which would eliminate the need for cels, the multiplane camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in ''The Little Mermaid''.

One of the film's most prominent songs, \"[[Part of Your World]]\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements, and Keane. Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" nearly being cut from 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when it was appealing to Katzenberg.

The 28th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and the first film in [[The Little Mermaid (franchise)|''The Little Mermaid'' franchise]], it is loosely based on the Danish [[fairy tale]] [[The Little Mermaid|of the same name]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The film tells the story of a [[mermaid]] Princess named [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Eric]]. Written and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], with music by [[Alan Menken]] and [[Howard Ashman]] (who also served as co-producer alongside John Musker), and art direction by [[Michael Peraza|Michael Peraza Jr.]] and Donald A.

She is fascinated by the human world above. She ventures out with her best friend [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|Flounder]] to collect human artifacts in her [[grotto]] and often goes to the surface of the ocean to visit [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], a seagull who offers inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She swims back to Atlantica and is watched by two eels named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flotsam and Jetsam|Flotsam and Jetsam]] under orders from [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]] the sea witch. Ariel ignores the warnings of her father [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], the ruler of Atlantica, and [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Sebastian|Sebastian]], a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact with humans is forbidden.\n\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder, and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the surface to watch a celebration for [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]]'s birthday on a ship. Ariel instantly falls in love with Eric. Shortly afterward, a violent storm arrives, which wrecks the ship and tosses Eric overboard. Ariel rescues him and brings him to shore. She sings to him but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find the girl who saved and sang to him; Ariel vows to find a way to join him in his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Triton confronts Ariel in her grotto and destroys the artifacts she collected with his trident. After Triton leaves, Ariel begins weeping. Flotsam and Jetsam convince her to visit Ursula.\n\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \"kiss of true love\" from Eric to remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel accepts and is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Unbeknownst to Ariel, Ursula, who harbors a secret vendetta against King Triton, plans to use her as a bargaining chip and take over the kingdom. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at Ariel's near success, Ursula disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel and marry Vanessa instead.\n\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who immediately pursues the wedding barge. While Sebastian informs Triton, Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. Through all of the commotion the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck breaks, which restores Ariel's voice back to her and breaks Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula then reveals herself and kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release. However, the deal is inviolable; Triton makes a new deal to take Ariel's place as Ursula's servant by giving up his trident in order to save his daughter. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the new ruler, but before she can use the trident, Ariel confronts Ursula and attacks her, and Eric intervenes with a harpoon and hurts Ursula. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes and causes Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. As Ariel hurries to join Eric, the enraged Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size.\n\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers over them. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. As Ursula is about to destroy Ariel with the trident, Eric steers a wrecked ship and kills Ursula by impaling her with its splintered [[bowsprit]]. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in Ursula's garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel loves Eric, Triton changes her from a mermaid into a human permanently and approves her marriage to Eric. At the wedding, Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Little Mermaid characters}}\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Princess Ariel]], the 16-year-old mermaid princess of Atlantica who is fascinated with humans, especially Prince Eric.<ref name=\"DisneyChar\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters (Third Edition)|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998|pages=344\u2013345|isbn=0-7868-6336-6}}</ref>\n:* Benson also voices Vanessa, Ursula's human alter ego\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]], a human prince saved by Ariel and is determined to find and marry her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2014|title=The-Little-Mermaid \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022533/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast|archive-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], a sea witch who stole Ariel's voice and is determined to ruin her attempts to get Eric to love her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n* [[Samuel E.

While in production in the 1980s, the staff found, by chance, original story and visual development work done by [[Kay Nielsen]] for Disney's proposed 1930s Andersen feature.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen's original story was coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\">(2006) ''Treasures Untold: The Making of Disney's 'The Little Mermaid'' [Documentary featurette].

However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''Oliver & Company'' as more immediate releases.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> In 1987, songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] became involved with the writing and development of ''The Little Mermaid'' after he was asked to contribute a song to ''Oliver & Company''. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make ''The Little Mermaid'' a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Ashman and composer [[Alan Menken]], both noted for their work as the writers of the successful [[Off-Broadway]] stage musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', teamed up to compose the entire song score.

Disney's next film, ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by [[Pixar]] called CAPS/ink & paint ([[Computer Animation Production System]]), which would eliminate the need for cels, the multiplane camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in ''The Little Mermaid''. A CAPS/ink & paint prototype was used experimentally on a few scenes in ''The Little Mermaid'', and one-shot produced using CAPS/ink & paint\u2014the penultimate shot in the film, of Ariel and Eric's wedding ship sailing away under a rainbow\u2014appears in the finished film. [[Computer-generated imagery]] was used to create some of the wrecked ships in the final battle, a staircase behind a shot of Ariel in Eric's castle, and the carriage Eric and Ariel are riding in when she bounces it over a ravine. These objects were animated using 3D wireframe models, which were [[plotter|plotted]] as line art to cels and painted traditionally.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> The film being both the first film of the [[Disney Renaissance]] and the last to use the [[xerography]] technology used since the late 1950s with ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' made it somewhat of a transitional film between the two Disney eras.<ref>https://www.tor.com/2015/07/23/the-advent-of-xerography-disneys-one-hundred-and-one-dalmatians/</ref><ref>https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/01/11/why-does-101-dalmatians-look-like-that/</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|The Little Mermaid (soundtrack)}}\n''The Little Mermaid'' was considered by some as \"the film that brought Broadway into cartoons\".<ref>''Aladdin'' Platinum Edition, Disc 2: ''Alan Menken: Musical''</ref> [[Alan Menken]] wrote the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning score, and collaborated with [[Howard Ashman]] on the songs. One of the film's most prominent songs, \"[[Part of Your World]]\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements, and Keane. Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" nearly being cut from 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when it was appealing to Katzenberg. Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state. During a second test screening, the scene, now colorized and further developed, tested well with a separate child audience, and the musical number was kept.<ref name=\"HCWIntv\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was originally released on November 17, 1989, followed by a re-release on November 14, 1997.

Sometimes called '''the Virgin Queen''', '''Gloriana''' or '''Good Queen Bess''', Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the [[House of Tudor]].\n\nElizabeth was the daughter of [[Henry VIII]] and [[Anne Boleyn]], his second wife, who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth's birth. Anne's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her half-brother, [[Edward VI]], ruled until his death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to [[Lady Jane Grey]] and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of [[Third Succession Act|statute law to the contrary]].  Edward's will was set aside and Mary became queen, deposing Lady Jane Grey. During Mary's reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\n\nIn 1558 upon Mary's death, Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel.<ref>\"I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.\" Elizabeth's first speech as queen, [[Hatfield House]], 20 November 1558. Loades, 35.</ref> She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]]. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the [[supreme governor]]. This [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] was to evolve into the [[Church of England]]. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. She was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, [[James VI of Scotland]]. She had earlier been responsible for the imprisonment and execution of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been.<ref name=\"starkey5\">Starkey ''Elizabeth: Woman'', 5.</ref> One of her mottoes was \"''video et taceo''\" (\"I see but say nothing\").<ref>Neale, 386.</ref> In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope [[Regnans in Excelsis|declared her illegitimate]] in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Spanish Kingdom|Spain]]. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the [[Netherlands]], France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war with Spain]].  England's victory against the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history.\n\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her [[virginity]]. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. Elizabeth's reign became known as the [[Elizabethan era]]. The period is famous for the flourishing of [[English Renaissance theatre|English drama]], led by playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]], and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as [[Francis Drake]]. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler,<ref>Somerset, 729.</ref> who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.<ref name=starkey5/>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.png|thumb|left|Elizabeth's parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.

Her mother was Henry's second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]]. At birth, Elizabeth was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, [[Catherine of Aragon]], to marry Anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession.<ref>Loades, 3\u20135</ref><ref>Somerset, 4\u20135.</ref> She was baptised on 10 September 1533; Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], the [[Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk|Duchess of Norfolk]] and the [[Margaret Wotton, Marchioness of Dorset|Dowager Marchioness of Dorset]] stood as her godparents.

His will ignored the [[Succession to the Crown Act 1543]], excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir [[Lady Jane Grey]], granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]]. Jane was proclaimed queen by the [[Privy Council of England|Privy council]], but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side.<ref>Elizabeth had assembled 2,000 horsemen, \"a remarkable tribute to the size of her affinity\". Loades 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n[[File:Felipe of Spain and MariaTudor-2010-13-09.jpg|thumb|Philip and Mary I, during whose reign Elizabeth was heir presumptive]]\nThe show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], the son of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] and an active Catholic.<ref>Loades, 27.</ref> Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.\n\nIn January and February 1554, [[Wyatt's rebellion]] broke out; it was soon suppressed.<ref>Neale, 45.</ref> Elizabeth was brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. Elizabeth fervently protested her innocence.<ref>Loades, 28.</ref> Though it is unlikely that she had plotted with the rebels, some of them were known to have approached her. Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador [[Simon Renard]], argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and the Chancellor, [[Stephen Gardiner]], worked to have Elizabeth put on trial.<ref>Somerset, 51.</ref> Elizabeth's supporters in the government, including [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|Lord Paget]], convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir [[Henry Bedingfeld|Henry Bedingfield]]. Crowds cheered her all along the way.<ref name=\"loades29\">Loades, 29.</ref><ref>\"The wives of Wycombe passed cake and wafers to her until her litter became so burdened that she had to beg them to stop.\" Neale, 49.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hatfield House Old Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Hatfield House, where Elizabeth lived during Mary's reign]]\n\nOn 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was recalled to court to attend the final stages of Mary's [[Mary I of England#False pregnancy|apparent pregnancy]]. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child.<ref>Loades, 32.</ref> Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.<ref>Somerset, 66.</ref>\n\nKing Philip, who ascended the Spanish throne in 1556, acknowledged the new political reality and cultivated his sister-in-law.

The speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval [[political theology]] of the sovereign's \"two bodies\": the body natural and the [[body politic]]:<ref>Kantorowicz, ix</ref>\n\n<blockquote>My lords, the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, considering I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring from the bottom of my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me.

She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.<ref name=collinson>Collinson, Patrick, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8636 \"Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2008).  Retrieved 23 August 2011.</ref>\n\nIn terms of public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with religious matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively-declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.\n\nElizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical [[Puritan]]s though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms.<ref>{{cite book|title=This Sceptred Isle 1547\u20131660|chapter=Disc 1|isbn=978-0-563-55769-2|last1=Lee|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Lee (historian)|origyear=1995|year=1998|title-link=This Sceptred Isle}}</ref> As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the [[Edward VI of England#Reformation|Protestant settlement of Edward VI]], with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.<ref>Loades, 46.</ref>\n\nThe [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the [[House of Lords]], particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the [[Archbishopric of Canterbury]].<ref>\"It was fortunate that ten out of twenty-six bishoprics were vacant, for of late there had been a high rate of mortality among the episcopate, and a fever had conveniently carried off Mary's Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Reginald Pole]], less than twenty-four hours after her own death\". Somerset, 98.</ref><ref>\"There were no less than ten sees unrepresented through death or illness and the carelessness of 'the accursed cardinal' [Pole]\".

The marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in February 1567 by conspirators almost certainly led by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. Elizabeth confronted Mary about the marriage, writing to her:\n\n<blockquote>How could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.<ref>Letter to Mary, Queen of Scots, 23 June 1567.\" Quoted by Loades, 69\u201370.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese events led rapidly to Mary's defeat and imprisonment in [[Loch Leven Castle]]. The Scottish lords forced her to [[abdicate]] in favour of her son [[James VI]], who had been born in June 1566. James was taken to [[Stirling Castle]] to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from [[Loch Leven (Kinross)|Loch Leven]] in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe.

Elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. Her strategy, to support the Dutch on the surface with an English army, while beginning secret peace talks with Spain within days of Leicester's arrival in Holland,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 43.</ref> had necessarily to be at odds with Leicester's, who wanted and was expected by the Dutch to fight an active campaign.

Elizabeth saw this as a Dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the Netherlands,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 50.</ref> which so far she had always declined. She wrote to Leicester:\n\n<blockquote>We could never have imagined (had we not seen it fall out in experience) that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour&nbsp;...

She often wrote to [[Ivan the Terrible]] on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance.

Feodor declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador Sir [[Jerome Bowes]], whose pomposity had been tolerated by Ivan. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent [[Boris Godunov]] that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor with two of his many titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters.

A new generation was in power.

See Neale, 382.</ref> The practice soon led to [[price fixing|price-fixing]], the enrichment of courtiers at the public's expense, and widespread resentment.<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 208.</ref> This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601.<ref>Black, 192\u2013194.</ref> In her famous \"[[Golden Speech]]\" of 30 November 1601 at [[Whitehall Palace]] to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:<ref>Neale, 383\u2013384.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess.

During the 1590s, some of the great names of [[English literature]] entered their maturity, including [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. During this period and into the [[Jacobean era]] that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks.<ref>Black, 239\u2013245.</ref> The notion of a great [[Elizabethan era]] depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign.

She was portrayed as [[Belphoebe]] or [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], and after the Armada, as [[Gloriana]], the eternally youthful [[Faerie Queene]] of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s poem.

Croft, 48.</ref> One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a [[succession to Elizabeth I of England|smooth succession]]. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret.<ref>Cecil wrote to James, \"The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird\". Willson, 154.</ref> He therefore entered into a [[Secret correspondence of James VI|coded negotiation]] with [[James VI of Scotland]], who had a strong but unrecognised claim.<ref>James VI of Scotland was a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England, and thus Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed, since Henry VII was Elizabeth's paternal grandfather.</ref> Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\".<ref>Willson, 154.</ref> The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\".<ref>Willson, 155.</ref> In historian J.&nbsp;E.

Sometimes called '''the Virgin Queen''', '''Gloriana''' or '''Good Queen Bess''', Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the [[House of Tudor]].\n\nElizabeth was the daughter of [[Henry VIII]] and [[Anne Boleyn]], his second wife, who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth's birth. Anne's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her half-brother, [[Edward VI]], ruled until his death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to [[Lady Jane Grey]] and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of [[Third Succession Act|statute law to the contrary]].  Edward's will was set aside and Mary became queen, deposing Lady Jane Grey. During Mary's reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\n\nIn 1558 upon Mary's death, Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel.<ref>\"I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.\" Elizabeth's first speech as queen, [[Hatfield House]], 20 November 1558. Loades, 35.</ref> She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]]. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the [[supreme governor]]. This [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] was to evolve into the [[Church of England]]. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. She was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, [[James VI of Scotland]]. She had earlier been responsible for the imprisonment and execution of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been.<ref name=\"starkey5\">Starkey ''Elizabeth: Woman'', 5.</ref> One of her mottoes was \"''video et taceo''\" (\"I see but say nothing\").<ref>Neale, 386.</ref> In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope [[Regnans in Excelsis|declared her illegitimate]] in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Spanish Kingdom|Spain]]. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the [[Netherlands]], France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war with Spain]].  England's victory against the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history.\n\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her [[virginity]]. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. Elizabeth's reign became known as the [[Elizabethan era]]. The period is famous for the flourishing of [[English Renaissance theatre|English drama]], led by playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]], and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as [[Francis Drake]]. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler,<ref>Somerset, 729.</ref> who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.<ref name=starkey5/>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.png|thumb|left|Elizabeth's parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.

Jane was proclaimed queen by the [[Privy Council of England|Privy council]], but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days.

Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], the son of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] and an active Catholic.<ref>Loades, 27.</ref> Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.\n\nIn January and February 1554, [[Wyatt's rebellion]] broke out; it was soon suppressed.<ref>Neale, 45.</ref> Elizabeth was brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].

She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.<ref name=collinson>Collinson, Patrick, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8636 \"Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2008).  Retrieved 23 August 2011.</ref>\n\nIn terms of public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with religious matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively-declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.\n\nElizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical [[Puritan]]s though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms.<ref>{{cite book|title=This Sceptred Isle 1547\u20131660|chapter=Disc 1|isbn=978-0-563-55769-2|last1=Lee|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Lee (historian)|origyear=1995|year=1998|title-link=This Sceptred Isle}}</ref> As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the [[Edward VI of England#Reformation|Protestant settlement of Edward VI]], with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.<ref>Loades, 46.</ref>\n\nThe [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the [[House of Lords]], particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the [[Archbishopric of Canterbury]].<ref>\"It was fortunate that ten out of twenty-six bishoprics were vacant, for of late there had been a high rate of mortality among the episcopate, and a fever had conveniently carried off Mary's Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Reginald Pole]], less than twenty-four hours after her own death\". Somerset, 98.</ref><ref>\"There were no less than ten sees unrepresented through death or illness and the carelessness of 'the accursed cardinal' [Pole]\". Black, 10.</ref> This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] rather than the more contentious title of [[Supreme Head]], which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. The new [[Act of Supremacy 1559|Act of Supremacy]] became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the [[heresy]] laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 [[Book of Common Prayer]] compulsory, though the penalties for [[recusancy]], or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.<ref>Somerset, 101\u2013103.</ref>\n\n== Marriage question ==\n\nFrom the start of Elizabeth's reign, it was expected that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships.<ref>Loades, 38.</ref><ref>Haigh, 19.</ref> She considered several suitors until she was about fifty.

The marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in February 1567 by conspirators almost certainly led by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. Elizabeth confronted Mary about the marriage, writing to her:\n\n<blockquote>How could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.<ref>Letter to Mary, Queen of Scots, 23 June 1567.\" Quoted by Loades, 69\u201370.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese events led rapidly to Mary's defeat and imprisonment in [[Loch Leven Castle]]. The Scottish lords forced her to [[abdicate]] in favour of her son [[James VI]], who had been born in June 1566. James was taken to [[Stirling Castle]] to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from [[Loch Leven (Kinross)|Loch Leven]] in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe.

The exception was the English occupation of [[Le Havre]] from October 1562 to June 1563, which ended in failure when Elizabeth's [[Huguenot]] allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port.

It also extended Spanish influence along the [[English Channel|channel]] coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion.<ref name=haigh135/> The [[Siege of Antwerp (1584\u20131585)|siege of Antwerp]] in the summer of 1585 by the Duke of Parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the English and the Dutch.

Elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. Her strategy, to support the Dutch on the surface with an English army, while beginning secret peace talks with Spain within days of Leicester's arrival in Holland,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 43.</ref> had necessarily to be at odds with Leicester's, who wanted and was expected by the Dutch to fight an active campaign.

Elizabeth saw this as a Dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the Netherlands,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 50.</ref> which so far she had always declined. She wrote to Leicester:\n\n<blockquote>We could never have imagined (had we not seen it fall out in experience) that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour&nbsp;...

The military campaign was severely hampered by Elizabeth's repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. Her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, Leicester's own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the faction-ridden and chaotic situation of Dutch politics led to the failure of the campaign.<ref>Haynes, 15; Strong and van Dorsten, 72\u201379.</ref> Leicester finally resigned his command in December 1587.\n\n===Spanish Armada===\n[[File:N\u00edcholas-Hilliard-Elizabeth-I-Queen-of-England-c-1586-87.tif|thumb|left|Portrait from 1586\u20131587, by Nicholas Hilliard, around the time of the voyages of Sir [[Francis Drake]]]]\nMeanwhile, Sir [[Francis Drake]] had undertaken a major voyage against Spanish ports and ships in the [[Caribbean]] in 1585 and 1586.

A new generation was in power. With the exception of Lord Burghley, the most important politicians had died around 1590: the Earl of Leicester in 1588; Sir Francis Walsingham in 1590; and Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] in 1591.<ref>Collinson, 89.</ref> Factional strife in the government, which had not existed in a noteworthy form before the 1590s,<ref>Doran, ''Monarchy'', 216.</ref> now became its hallmark.<ref>Hammer, 1\u20132.</ref> A&nbsp;bitter rivalry arose between the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], son of Lord Burghley and their respective adherents, and the struggle for the most powerful positions in the state marred politics.<ref>Hammer, 1, 9.</ref> The queen's personal authority was lessening,<ref>Hammer, 9\u201310</ref> as is shown in the 1594 affair of Dr. Lopez, her trusted physician. When he was wrongly accused by the Earl of Essex of treason out of personal pique, she could not prevent his execution, although she had been angry about his arrest and seems not to have believed in his guilt.<ref>Lacey, 117\u2013120</ref>\n\nDuring the last years of her reign, Elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a cost-free system of patronage, rather than asking Parliament for more subsidies in a time of war.<ref>A Patent of Monopoly gave the holder control over an aspect of trade or manufacture. See Neale, 382.</ref> The practice soon led to [[price fixing|price-fixing]], the enrichment of courtiers at the public's expense, and widespread resentment.<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 208.</ref> This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601.<ref>Black, 192\u2013194.</ref> In her famous \"[[Golden Speech]]\" of 30 November 1601 at [[Whitehall Palace]] to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:<ref>Neale, 383\u2013384.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess.

During the 1590s, some of the great names of [[English literature]] entered their maturity, including [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. During this period and into the [[Jacobean era]] that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks.<ref>Black, 239\u2013245.</ref> The notion of a great [[Elizabethan era]] depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.<ref>Haigh, 176.</ref>\n\nAs Elizabeth aged her image gradually changed. She was portrayed as [[Belphoebe]] or [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], and after the Armada, as [[Gloriana]], the eternally youthful [[Faerie Queene]] of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s poem. Elizabeth gave [[Edmund Spenser]] a pension, as this was unusual for her, it indicates that she liked his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivebooks.com/best-books/helen-hackett-on-elizabeth-i/|title=The best books on Elizabeth I \u2013 a Five Books interview with Helen Hackett|website=Five Books|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic [[iconography|icons]] that made her look much younger than she was.

Like Henry IV of France, she projected an image of herself which brought stability and prestige to her country. By constant attention to the details of her total performance, she kept the rest of the cast on their toes and kept her own part as queen.\" Haigh, 179.</ref> but it is possible that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who was Leicester's stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him.<ref name = \"Lds\">Loades, 93.</ref> She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex's desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies.<ref>Loades, 97.</ref> In February 1601, the earl tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. An observer wrote in 1602: \"Her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail Essex.\"<ref>Black, 410.</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n\nElizabeth's senior adviser, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], died on 4 August 1598. His political mantle passed to his son, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], who soon became the leader of the government.<ref>After Essex's downfall, James VI of Scotland referred to Cecil as \"king there in effect\". Croft, 48.</ref> One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a [[succession to Elizabeth I of England|smooth succession]]. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret.<ref>Cecil wrote to James, \"The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird\". Willson, 154.</ref> He therefore entered into a [[Secret correspondence of James VI|coded negotiation]] with [[James VI of Scotland]], who had a strong but unrecognised claim.<ref>James VI of Scotland was a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England, and thus Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed, since Henry VII was Elizabeth's paternal grandfather.</ref> Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\".<ref>Willson, 154.</ref> The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\".<ref>Willson, 155.</ref> In historian J.&nbsp;E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with \"unmistakable if veiled phrases\".<ref>Neale, 385.</ref>\n\n[[File:Funeral Elisabeth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.85|Elizabeth's funeral cort\u00e8ge, 1603, with banners of her royal ancestors]]\n\nThe Queen's health remained fair until the autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of [[Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham]], the niece of her cousin and close friend [[Catherine Carey|Lady Knollys]], came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a \"settled and unremovable melancholy\", and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end.<ref>Black, 411.</ref> When Robert Cecil told her that she must go to bed, she snapped: \"Must is not a word to use to princes, little man.\" She died on 24 March 1603 at [[Richmond Palace]], between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed James King of England.<ref>Black, 410\u2013411.</ref>\n\nWhile it has become normative to record the death of the Queen as occurring in 1603, following [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|English calendar reform]] in the 1750s, at the time England observed [[New Year's Day]] on 25 March, commonly known as [[Lady Day]]. Thus Elizabeth died on the last day of the year 1602 in the old calendar.

But the ideas are present, as is the idea of romantic leadership of a nation in peril, because they were present in Elizabethan times\".</ref> Historians of that period, such as [[J. E. Neale]] (1934) and [[A. L.

Somerset, 102.</ref> Historians note that in her day, strict Protestants regarded the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Acts of Settlement and Uniformity of 1559]] as a compromise.<ref>Haigh, 45\u201346, 177.</ref><ref>Black, 14\u201315.</ref> In fact, Elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as [[Francis Bacon]] put it, to \"make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts\".<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 50.</ref><ref>Haigh, 42.</ref>\n\nThough Elizabeth followed a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England's status abroad. \"She is only a woman, only mistress of half an island,\" marvelled [[Pope Sixtus V]], \"and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by [[Holy Roman Empire|the Empire]], by all\".<ref name=\"somerset1\">Somerset, 727.</ref> Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as [[Christendom]] fragmented.<ref name=somerset726/><ref>Hogge, 9''n''.</ref><ref>Loades, 1.</ref> Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent.<ref>As Elizabeth's [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], Sir [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]], put it on her behalf to parliament in 1559, the queen \"is not, nor ever meaneth to be, so wedded to her own will and fantasy that for the satisfaction thereof she will do anything&nbsp;... to bring any bondage or servitude to her people, or give any just occasion to them of any inward grudge whereby any tumults or stirs might arise as hath done of late days\".
