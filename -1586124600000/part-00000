The blood plasma levels of [[simvastatin]] were reduced by 57% after a single dose of tocilizumab, but it is not known whether this is clinically relevant. A possible mechanism is that the elevated IL-6 levels of patients with RA suppress the biosynthesis of various [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes, notably [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP3A4]]. Tocilizumab lowers IL-6 and thus normalises cytochrome levels, increasing the metabolization of simvastatin (and possibly other cytochrome metabolised drugs).<ref name=\"Arzneistoff-Profile\" />\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nBesides other functions, [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6) is involved in the development of immunological and inflammatory reactions. [[Autoimmune disease]]s like RA are associated with abnormally high IL-6 levels.

The blood plasma levels of [[simvastatin]] were reduced by 57% after a single dose of tocilizumab, but it is not known whether this is clinically relevant. A possible mechanism is that the elevated IL-6 levels of patients with RA suppress the biosynthesis of various [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes, notably [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP3A4]]. Tocilizumab lowers IL-6 and thus normalises cytochrome levels, increasing the metabolization of simvastatin (and possibly other cytochrome metabolised drugs).<ref name=\"Arzneistoff-Profile\" />\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nBesides other functions, [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6) is involved in the development of immunological and inflammatory reactions. [[Autoimmune disease]]s like RA are associated with abnormally high IL-6 levels.

Like all parts of the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic [[alkaloid]] [[solanine]] and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called \"true potato seed\", \"TPS\" or \"botanical seed\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be [[vegetative propagation|propagated vegetatively]] by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.\n\n== Genetics ==\nThere are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide. Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone, mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. They belong to eight or nine species, depending on the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties, there are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species.

The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two different potato starch compounds: [[amylose]] and [[amylopectin]]. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, which is a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape after being boiled in water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Potato Primer |publisher=[[Cooks Illustrated]] |url=http://www.cooksillustrated.com/images/document/howto/JF07_PotatoPrimer.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217030233/http://www.cooksillustrated.com/images/document/howto/JF07_PotatoPrimer.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008}}</ref> Potatoes that are good for making [[potato chip]]s or potato crisps are sometimes called \"chipping potatoes\", which means they meet the basic requirements of similar varietal characteristics, being firm, fairly clean, and fairly well-shaped.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/potatoes-chipping-grades-and-standards|title=Potatoes for Chipping Grades and Standards {{!}} Agricultural Marketing Service|website=www.ams.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=27 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[European Cultivated Potato Database]] (ECPD) is an online collaborative database of potato variety descriptions that is updated and maintained by the [[Scottish Agricultural Science Agency]] within the framework of the European Cooperative Programme for Crop Genetic Resources Networks (ECP/GR)\u2014which is run by the [[International Plant Genetic Resources Institute]] (IPGRI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europotato.org/menu.php |title=Europotato.org |publisher=Europotato.org |accessdate=16 July 2010}}</ref>\n<!--List is at [[List of potato cultivars]], don't add here!-->\n\n=== Pigmentation ===\n[[File:Papas de colores de Chiloe.jpg|thumb|right|Potatoes with different pigmentation]] [[File:BlauerSchwede02.JPG|thumb|alt=Two dark-skinned potatoes on a white plate.

These compounds, which protect the potato plant from its predators, are generally concentrated in its leaves, flowers, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the tubers).<ref>{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}</ref> In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in the flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh. (The glycoalkaloid content was, in order from highest to lowest: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin{{Clarify|reason=skin of what|date=August 2018}}, roots, berries, peel [skin plus outer cortex of tuber flesh], stems, and tuber flesh.)<ref name=fried/>\n\nExposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber.<ref name=\"Greening of potatoes\"/> Cooking at high temperatures\u2014over {{convert|170|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\u2014partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloids in [[Solanum jamesii|wild potatoes]] is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloid poisoning may cause headaches, [[diarrhea]], [[cramps]], and, in severe cases, coma and death. However, poisoning from cultivated potato varieties is very rare. Light exposure causes greening from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, giving a visual clue as to which areas of the tuber may have become more toxic. However, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other.\n\nDifferent potato varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids.

In the third phase the tips of the stolons swell forming new [[tubers]] and the shoots continue to grow and flowers typically develop soon after. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical to a good yield: optimal [[soil moisture]] and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to [[Pest (organism)|pest attacks]]. The fifth phase is the maturation of the tubers: the plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and the [[Plant sugars|sugars]] in the tubers convert to starches.<ref>{{cite web |title=Potatoes Home Garden |url=https://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/lawn-and-garden/potatoes-home-garden/ |website=sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu |publisher=UF/IFAS Extension |accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"JefferiesLawson1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Jefferies|first1=R.

Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are [[roguing|rogued]] in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.\n\nPotatoes are sensitive to heavy [[frost]]s, which damage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop.\n\n=== Pests ===\n{{Main|List of potato diseases}}\nThe historically significant ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' (late blight) remains an ongoing problem in Europe<ref name=\"PlDis2011\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njf.nu/filebank/files/20060330$fil$vodD3dJE390Hb92eKsGd.pdf|title=NJF seminar No. 388 Integrated Control of Potato Late Blight in the Nordic and Baltic Countries.

The [[potato cyst nematode]] is a microscopic worm that thrives on the roots, thus causing the potato plants to wilt. Since its eggs can survive in the soil for several years, [[crop rotation]] is recommended.\n\nDuring the crop year 2008, many of the [[certified organic food|certified organic]] potatoes produced in the United Kingdom and certified by the [[Soil Association]] as organic were sprayed with a [[copper pesticide]]<ref>Section 4.11.11, page 103 [http://92.52.112.178/web/sacert/sacertweb.nsf/e8c12cf77637ec6c80256a6900374463/4d7054234b8da20a8025740b0012f83f/$FILE/ATTW3W7S/Soil%20Association%20Organic%20Standards%20for%20Producers%202009.pdf Soil Association Organic Standards for Producer, Version 16, January, 2009]</ref> to control potato blight (''Phytophthora infestans'').

Eastern Siberia.jpg|thumb|Potato flower close-up. Eastern Siberia]]\nAt harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong \"grape\" (or graip), i.e., a [[Garden fork|spading fork]], or a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90[[Degree (angle)|\u00b0]] angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large [[potato harvester]]s, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.\n\nImmature potatoes may be sold as \"creamer potatoes\"{{anchor|creamer potatoes|new potatoes}} and are particularly valued for taste. These are often harvested by the home gardener or farmer by \"grabbling\", i.e. pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the plant in place. A creamer potato is a variety of potato harvested before it matures to keep it small and tender. It is generally either a [[Yukon Gold potato]] or a red potato, called gold creamers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyplate.com/nutrition-calories/food/fresh-direct/gold-creamer-potato|title=Calories in Fresh Direct Gold Creamer Potato|publisher=The Daily Plate, LLC|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> or red creamers respectively, and measures approximately {{convert|1|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=\"recipe tips\">{{cite web|url=http://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--35863/creamer-potato.asp|title=Creamer Potato|publisher=recipetips.com|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> The skin of creamer potatoes is waxy and high in moisture content, and the flesh contains a lower level of [[starch]] than other potatoes. Like potatoes in general, they can be prepared by boiling, baking, frying, and roasting.<ref name=\"recipe tips\" /> Slightly older than creamer potatoes are \"new potatoes\"{{anchor|new potato}}, which are also prized for their taste and texture and often come from the same varieties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Randal|first=Oulton|date=24 July 2006|title=Creamer Potatoes|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/creamer-potatoes|website=CooksInfo.com|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nPotatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures {{convert|50|to|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.<ref>Kleinkopf G.E. and N. Olsen. 2003.

The only requirement involves cooking to swell the starch granules. Most potato dishes are served hot but some are first cooked, then served cold, notably [[potato salad]] and [[potato chip|potato chips (crisps)]]. Common dishes are: [[mashed potato]]es, which are first boiled (usually peeled), and then mashed with milk or [[yogurt]] and butter; whole [[baked potato]]es; [[boiling|boiled]] or [[steaming|steamed]] potatoes; [[French fries|French-fried potatoes or chips]]; cut into cubes and [[roasting|roasted]]; [[scalloped potatoes|scalloped]], diced, or sliced and fried ([[home fries]]); grated into small thin strips and fried ([[hash browns]]); grated and formed into [[dumpling]]s, [[R\u00f6sti]] or [[potato pancake]]s. Unlike many foods, potatoes can also be easily cooked in a [[microwave oven]] and still retain nearly all of their nutritional value, provided they are covered in ventilated [[plastic wrap]] to prevent moisture from escaping; this method produces a meal very similar to a steamed potato, while retaining the appearance of a conventionally baked potato. Potato chunks also commonly appear as a [[stew]] ingredient.

One popular favourite involves a baked potato with cheddar cheese (or sour cream and [[chives]]) on top, and in [[New England]] \"smashed potatoes\" (a chunkier variation on mashed potatoes, retaining the peel) have great popularity. Potato flakes are popular as an instant variety of mashed potatoes, which reconstitute into mashed potatoes by adding water, with butter or oil and salt to taste. A regional dish of [[Central New York]], [[salt potatoes]] are bite-size new potatoes boiled in water saturated with salt then served with melted butter. At more formal dinners, a common practice includes taking small red potatoes, slicing them, and roasting them in an iron skillet. Among [[American Jews]], the practice of eating [[latkes]] (fried potato pancakes) is common during the festival of [[Hanukkah]].\n\nA traditional [[Acadian]] dish from [[New Brunswick]] is known as ''poutine r\u00e2p\u00e9e''. The Acadian poutine is a ball of grated and [[mashed potato]], salted, sometimes filled with pork in the centre, and boiled. The result is a moist ball about the size of a [[baseball (ball)|baseball]]. It is commonly eaten with salt and pepper or [[brown sugar]]. It is believed to have originated from the German ''[[Kl\u00f6\u00dfe]]'', prepared by early German settlers who lived among the Acadians. ''[[Poutine]]'', by contrast, is a hearty serving of French fries, fresh [[cheese curd]]s and hot gravy. Tracing its origins to [[Quebec]] in the 1950s, it has become a widespread and popular dish throughout Canada.\n\nPotato grading for [[Idaho]] potatoes is performed in which No. 1 potatoes are the highest quality and No. 2 are rated as lower in quality due to their appearance (e.g. blemishes or bruises, pointy ends).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.idahopotato.com/faqs#63 | title=Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=Idaho Potato Commission | accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> Potato density assessment can be performed by floating them in brines.<ref name=Sivasankar>{{cite book |last=Sivasankar |first=B. |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbxGHBUY0BcC&pg=PA175 |title=Food Processing and Preservation |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

In India, the most popular potato dishes are ''aloo ki sabzi'', [[batata vada]], and [[samosa]], which is spicy mashed potato mixed with a small amount of vegetable stuffed in conical dough, and deep fried. Potatoes are also a major ingredient as fast food items, such as aloo chaat, where they are deep fried and served with [[chutney]]. In Northern India, alu dum and alu paratha are a favourite part of the diet; the first is a spicy curry of boiled potato, the second is a type of stuffed chapati.\n\nA dish called [[masala dosa]] from South India is very notable all over India. It is a thin pancake of rice and [[legume|pulse]] batter rolled over spicy smashed potato and eaten with sambhar and chutney. Poori in south India in particular in Tamil Nadu is almost always taken with smashed potato masal. Other favourite dishes are alu tikki and pakoda items.\n\n[[Vada pav]] is a popular vegetarian fast food dish in Mumbai and other regions in the Maharashtra in India.\n\nAloo posto (a curry with potatoes and poppy seeds) is immensely popular in East India, especially Bengal. Although potatoes are not native to India, it has become a vital part of food all over the country especially North Indian food preparations. In Tamil Nadu this tuber acquired a name based on its appearance 'urulai-k-kizhangu' (\u0b89\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1) meaning cylindrical tuber.\n\nThe [[Aloo gosht]], Potato and meat [[curry]], is one of the popular dishes in [[South Asia]], especially in [[Pakistan]].\n\n===East Asia===\nIn East Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, rice is by far the predominant starch crop, with potatoes a secondary crop, especially in China and Japan. However, it is used in northern China where rice is not easily grown, with a popular dish being \u9752\u6912\u571f\u8c46\u4e1d (q\u012bng ji\u0101o t\u01d4 d\u00f2u s\u012b), made with green pepper, vinegar and thin slices of potato. In the winter, roadside sellers in northern China will also sell roasted potatoes. It is also occasionally seen in Korean and Thai cuisines.<ref name=Solomon>{{cite book |title=Charmaine Solomon's Encyclopedia of Asian Food |author=Solomon, Charmaine |year=1996 |publisher=William Heinemann Australia |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-0-85561-688-5|page=293}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural significance ==\n===In art===\nThe potato has been an essential crop in the [[Andes]] since the [[pre-Columbian]] Era.

Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce [[glycoalkaloids]] in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.<ref name=\"fried\">{{cite journal|author=Mendel Friedman, Gary M.

Like all parts of the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic [[alkaloid]] [[solanine]] and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called \"true potato seed\", \"TPS\" or \"botanical seed\" to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be [[vegetative propagation|propagated vegetatively]] by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.\n\n== Genetics ==\nThere are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide. Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone, mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. They belong to eight or nine species, depending on the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties, there are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species.

Following the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]], the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century, part of the [[Columbian exchange]]. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom.<ref name=\"John Michael Francis 2005\"/> However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease.

The potato is rarely eaten raw because raw potato starch is poorly digested by humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beazell|first=JM|last2=Schmidt|first2=CR|last3=Ivy|first3=AC|date=January 1939|title=On the Digestibility of Raw Potato Starch in Man|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=17|issue=1|pages= 77\u201383|doi=10.1093/jn/17.1.77}}</ref> When a potato is baked, its contents of vitamin B6 and vitamin C decline notably, while there is little significant change in the amount of other nutrients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2770/2|title=Nutrient contents of potato, baked, flesh and skin, without salt per 100 grams|publisher=Nutritiondata.com, Conde Nast for the US National Nutrient Database, SR-21|date=2014|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nPotatoes are often broadly classified as having a high [[glycemic index]] (GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a [[low-glycemic index diet|low-GI diet]].

Solanine is found in other plants in the same family, [[Solanaceae]], which includes such plants as deadly nightshade (''[[Atropa belladonna]]''), henbane (''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'') and tobacco (''[[Nicotiana|Nicotiana spp.]]''), as well as the food plants [[eggplant]] and [[tomato]]. These compounds, which protect the potato plant from its predators, are generally concentrated in its leaves, flowers, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the tubers).<ref>{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}</ref> In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in the flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh. (The glycoalkaloid content was, in order from highest to lowest: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin{{Clarify|reason=skin of what|date=August 2018}}, roots, berries, peel [skin plus outer cortex of tuber flesh], stems, and tuber flesh.)<ref name=fried/>\n\nExposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber.<ref name=\"Greening of potatoes\"/> Cooking at high temperatures\u2014over {{convert|170|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}\u2014partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloids in [[Solanum jamesii|wild potatoes]] is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloid poisoning may cause headaches, [[diarrhea]], [[cramps]], and, in severe cases, coma and death. However, poisoning from cultivated potato varieties is very rare. Light exposure causes greening from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, giving a visual clue as to which areas of the tuber may have become more toxic. However, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other.\n\nDifferent potato varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The [[Lenape (potato)|Lenape]] variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids.<ref name=\"boing\">{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2013/03/25/the-case-of-the-poison-potato.html|title=The case of the poison potato|publisher=boingboing.net|author=Marggie Koerth-Baker|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref> Since then, breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising [[cultivar]]. Breeders try to keep glycoalkaloid levels below 200&nbsp;mg/kg (200 [[Parts-per notation|ppmw]]). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, they can still approach [[solanine]] concentrations of 1000&nbsp;mg/kg (1000 ppmw).

To be disease free, the areas where seed potatoes are grown are selected with care. In the US, this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of all 50 states where potatoes are grown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potatoesusa.com/potato-products/seed-potatoes |title=United States Potato Board -Seed Potatoes|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> These locations are selected for their cold, hard winters that kill pests and summers with long sunshine hours for optimum growth.

During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second, [[photosynthesis]] begins as the plant develops leaves and branches above-ground and [[stolon]]s develop from lower leaf [[axil]]s on the below-ground stem. In the third phase the tips of the stolons swell forming new [[tubers]] and the shoots continue to grow and flowers typically develop soon after. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical to a good yield: optimal [[soil moisture]] and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to [[Pest (organism)|pest attacks]]. The fifth phase is the maturation of the tubers: the plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and the [[Plant sugars|sugars]] in the tubers convert to starches.<ref>{{cite web |title=Potatoes Home Garden |url=https://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/lawn-and-garden/potatoes-home-garden/ |website=sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu |publisher=UF/IFAS Extension |accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"JefferiesLawson1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Jefferies|first1=R.

Since exposure to light leads to an undesirable greening of the skins and the development of [[solanine]] as a protection from the sun's rays, growers cover surface tubers. Commercial growers cover them by piling additional soil around the base of the plant as it grows (called \"hilling\" up, or in British English \"earthing up\"). An alternative method, used by home gardeners and smaller-scale growers, involves covering the growing area with organic [[mulch]]es such as straw or plastic sheets.<ref name=\"cornell1\">{{cite web|url=http://suffolk-lamp.cit.cornell.edu/assets/Horticulture-Leaflets/Growing-Potatoes-in-the-Home-Garden.pdf|publisher=[[Cornell University]] [[Cooperative extension service|Extension Service]]|title=Growing Potatoes in the Home Garden|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nCorrect potato husbandry can be an arduous task in some circumstances.

Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are [[roguing|rogued]] in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.\n\nPotatoes are sensitive to heavy [[frost]]s, which damage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop.\n\n=== Pests ===\n{{Main|List of potato diseases}}\nThe historically significant ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' (late blight) remains an ongoing problem in Europe<ref name=\"PlDis2011\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njf.nu/filebank/files/20060330$fil$vodD3dJE390Hb92eKsGd.pdf|title=NJF seminar No. 388 Integrated Control of Potato Late Blight in the Nordic and Baltic Countries.

Eastern Siberia.jpg|thumb|Potato flower close-up. Eastern Siberia]]\nAt harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong \"grape\" (or graip), i.e., a [[Garden fork|spading fork]], or a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90[[Degree (angle)|\u00b0]] angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large [[potato harvester]]s, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.\n\nImmature potatoes may be sold as \"creamer potatoes\"{{anchor|creamer potatoes|new potatoes}} and are particularly valued for taste. These are often harvested by the home gardener or farmer by \"grabbling\", i.e. pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the plant in place. A creamer potato is a variety of potato harvested before it matures to keep it small and tender. It is generally either a [[Yukon Gold potato]] or a red potato, called gold creamers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyplate.com/nutrition-calories/food/fresh-direct/gold-creamer-potato|title=Calories in Fresh Direct Gold Creamer Potato|publisher=The Daily Plate, LLC|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> or red creamers respectively, and measures approximately {{convert|1|in|cm}} in diameter.<ref name=\"recipe tips\">{{cite web|url=http://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--35863/creamer-potato.asp|title=Creamer Potato|publisher=recipetips.com|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> The skin of creamer potatoes is waxy and high in moisture content, and the flesh contains a lower level of [[starch]] than other potatoes. Like potatoes in general, they can be prepared by boiling, baking, frying, and roasting.<ref name=\"recipe tips\" /> Slightly older than creamer potatoes are \"new potatoes\"{{anchor|new potato}}, which are also prized for their taste and texture and often come from the same varieties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Randal|first=Oulton|date=24 July 2006|title=Creamer Potatoes|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/creamer-potatoes|website=CooksInfo.com|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nPotatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures {{convert|50|to|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.<ref>Kleinkopf G.E. and N. Olsen. 2003.

The only requirement involves cooking to swell the starch granules. Most potato dishes are served hot but some are first cooked, then served cold, notably [[potato salad]] and [[potato chip|potato chips (crisps)]]. Common dishes are: [[mashed potato]]es, which are first boiled (usually peeled), and then mashed with milk or [[yogurt]] and butter; whole [[baked potato]]es; [[boiling|boiled]] or [[steaming|steamed]] potatoes; [[French fries|French-fried potatoes or chips]]; cut into cubes and [[roasting|roasted]]; [[scalloped potatoes|scalloped]], diced, or sliced and fried ([[home fries]]); grated into small thin strips and fried ([[hash browns]]); grated and formed into [[dumpling]]s, [[R\u00f6sti]] or [[potato pancake]]s. Unlike many foods, potatoes can also be easily cooked in a [[microwave oven]] and still retain nearly all of their nutritional value, provided they are covered in ventilated [[plastic wrap]] to prevent moisture from escaping; this method produces a meal very similar to a steamed potato, while retaining the appearance of a conventionally baked potato. Potato chunks also commonly appear as a [[stew]] ingredient. Potatoes are boiled between 10 and 25<ref>[[b:Cookbook:Potato]]</ref> minutes, depending on size and type, to become soft.\n\n=== Other than for eating ===\nPotatoes are also used for purposes other than eating by humans, for example:\n* Potatoes are used to brew alcoholic beverages such as [[vodka]], [[poit\u00edn]], or [[akvavit]].\n* They are also used as [[fodder]] for [[livestock]]. Livestock-grade potatoes, considered too small and/or blemished to sell or market for human use but suitable for fodder use, have been called ''chats'' in some dialects.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials. Although Raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear, his presence was not emphasized.<ref name=\"Making\" /> The surprise to fans that Raiden was not Snake was admitted by Kojima to have been inspired by the plot twist of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' where the titular character played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was not a villain in that movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/commentary2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713081833/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/commentary2.html|title=Big Shell Infiltration \uff5e Contact Peter Stillman|publisher=Shinobu Wbes|archivedate=July 13, 2011|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref> Raiden's appearance in the game was announced to the Japanese press on the day of the game's release in North America.<ref>{{cite video game|title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2|year=2002|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|quote=}}</ref> Due to negative response to Raiden's role in the game, Kojima said in retrospective that the team failed to properly show the character.<ref name=\"spong\"/>\n\n===Further development===\nRaiden's new design for ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' was a response to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

Between 2001 and 2014 Chechnya has received over 464 billion roubles in subsidies, grants and donations with federal subsidies accounting for 80% of the republic's budget (and this does not include funds allocated for infrastructure managed at federal level such as roads). However, the administration of Chechnya is being criticized for spending public funds for their personal benefit\u2014in 2010 [[Dmitry Medvedev]] noted that \"federal funds often do not reach people; we know where they disappear; it is obvious-they are being stolen\". For example, the fleet of official vehicles in Chechnya accounts for half of all official vehicles in all Northern Caucasus republics. Public funds are being funnelled through [[Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation]], which\u2014while being registered as a charity\u2014has never produced or published any financial reports as required by Russian law. These violations are ignored by [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Justice]], which in many cases has enforced them very strictly against other charities. The foundation operates a building company that services most of the publicly procured infrastructure projects in the republic and also collects a fee from all working citizens of Chechnya, ranging from 10 to 30% of their earnings, raising 3\u20134 billion roubles per year this way. Kadyrov himself declares annual income of 4.84 million roubles (2015), which is inconsistent with his lavish life-style, luxury vehicles, watches, race horses and mansions.<ref name=\"Yashin2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.4freerussia.org/a-threat-to-national-security-download-the-english-ver/ |title=A Threat to National Security |accessdate=1 March 2016 |author=Yashin, Ilya}}</ref>\n\n== 2009 assassination attempt ==\nAn assassination attempt on Kadyrov and a parliament member [[Adam Delimkhanov]] was averted on 23 October 2009, by the police.

The conference was attended by notable Islamic scholars including the [[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]], [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]]; [[Grand Mufti]] of [[Egypt]], [[Shawki Allam]]; ex-Grand Mufti of Egypt [[Ali Gomaa]], Usama al-Azhari who is the religious adviser to [[Egyptian President]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]; [[Habib Ali al-Jifri]] and the [[mufti]] of [[Damascus]] Abdul Fattah al-Bizm. The conference was convened to discuss the alleged abuse of Islamic ideas to propagate extremism and to establish the criteria for determining who are the true followers of the [[Sunnah]]. The assembly of scholars issued a [[fatwa]] which declared that those who abide by the [[Kalam]], belong to the four [[Schools of Sunni law|madhhabs]] and follow the path of moral self-perfection espoused by distinguished Islamic teachers, primarily the [[Sufi]] [[Sheikh (Sufism)|sheikhs]], were the only true believers. The fatwa called the sect of [[Salafism]] as a \"dangerous and erroneous contemporary sect\", along with the extremist groups like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]. The conference also issued two further documents. In the first one, it appealed to President Vladimir Putin to ban Salafism and term any condemnation of \"[[traditional Islam]]\" as \"extremism\". It also proposed the fatwa be regarded as the considered opinion of \"leading Russian experts\" when evaluating the activity of Muslim organizations and the preaching of individual clerics. The second one issued a resolution calling for the establishment of a Council for Islamic Education and also a Council of [[Ulema]], which would rule on who is and is not a true follower of [[Sunni Islam]].<ref name=\"RfeRl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/caucasus-report-grozny-fatwa-controversy/27987472.html|title=Analysis: Grozny Fatwa On 'True Believers' Triggers Major Controversy|last1=Fuller|first1=Liz|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/soul-of-islam-uae-saudi-arabia-religion-gulf-countries/|title=UAE Vs.

Many of the key participants also disavowed the resolutions. Mukkadas Bibarsov, [[mufti]] of [[Saratov Oblast]] stated that the question of who was a true follower of Sunni Islam was resolved \"centuries ago\". He also added that the fatwa failed to take into account the crucial differences between Russia's Muslims, specifically that some Muslim communities did not follow [[Sufism]]. Liz Fuller writing for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] commented that the fatwa seemed to be giving permission to Kadyrov to take any action he likes to punish those whose religious views don't match with his own. Yaroslav Trofimov writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described it as a \"new fracture emerging within Islam\". Many Saudi clerics and citizens expressed outrage at the fatwa on social media.

We have to be reckoned with. \u2026 If you are masters of your territory, then you must control it.\"<ref name= \"moscow times\"/> According to Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, \"Some critics claim that Mr. Putin now fears Mr. Kadyrov because he knows any serious attempt to challenge the Chechen leader\u2019s position might lead to a third war.\"<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/opinion/chechnya-ramzan-kadyrov-russia.html Is Chechnya Taking Over Russia?]\" ''The New York Times.'' 17 August 2017.</ref>\n\n===Mixed martial arts tournament involving child fighters===\nA [[mixed martial arts]] tournament involving children was held as an \"exhibition fight\" on 4 October during the ''Grand Prix Akhmat 2016'' in Grozny and broadcast on [[Match TV]]. Three of Kadyrov's sons, all of them aged under 12, fought in the tournament with Kadyrov sitting in the audience and none of the fighters wearing any protective gear. One of the fights ended with a [[technical knockout]]. Kadyrov also posted images of the bouts on his Instagram account. The event caused an outcry especially against Ramzan allowing his children to compete in the tournament. [[Fedor Emelianenko]], the president of Russian MMA Union, criticised the event as \"inexcusable\", stating that rules stipulate fighters under the age of 21 have to wear protective gear while children under the age of 12 are not allowed to compete. Vadim Finkelstein, the head of MMA promotion [[M-1 Global]] also backed Fedor's comments. [[Dmitry Peskov]], the spokesperson for President Putin, stated that the fact that one of the fights between the children finished with a technical knockout was \u201ca reason for the appropriate oversight agencies to inquire about this incident.\u201d [[Ministry of Sport (Russia)|Deputy Minister of Sports]] [[Pavel Kolobkov]] stated that participation of children under the age of 12 in MMA competitions was illegal while stating that the incident was being investigated. Sports Minister [[Vitaly Mutko]] also stated that the event will be investigated. MMA fighter [[Jeff Monson]] however backed the organisers stating that there was nothing wrong with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-chechnya-comment-6df5bcbe-8c84-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506-20161007-story.html|title=Kiddie fight offers insight into Putin's approach to Chechnya Leonid Bershidsky|last1=Bershidsky|first1=Leonid|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/chechen-leader-blasted-watches-children-9010015|title=Chechen leader blasted as he watches his own children fighting in UFC-style cage battles\n|last1=Logan|first1=Ross|publisher= Daily Mirror|date=9 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/ramzan-kadyrov-accused-of-child-cruelty-after-entering-pre-teen/|title=Ramzan Kadyrov accused of child cruelty after entering pre-teen sons in televised cage fights|publisher= The Telegraph|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nytimes.com/2016/10/07/world/europe/chechnya-kadyrov-child-fights.html|title=Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechen Strongman, Criticized Over Televised Child Fights|work= New York Times|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/10/06/kremlin-calls-for-investigation-into-televised-fights-between-kids-as-young-as-8.html|title=Kremlin calls for investigation into televised fights between kids as young as 8|publisher= Toronto Star|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeveral Chechen officials responded to Fedor's criticism with insults and accusations including Timur Dugazayev, general director of Akhmat MMA promotion, [[State Duma|Member of Parliament]] [[Adam Delimkhanov]] as well as Kadyrov himself.<ref name=\"RTSport\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/sport/361798-kids-mma-fights-chechnya-kadyrov/|title=Underage kids' MMA fights in Chechnya spark criticism of Kadyrov (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)|publisher= RT|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/society/stories/12-10-2016/135857-childrens_fights_chechnya-0/|title=Children's MMA fights in Chechnya: Immoral behaviour that only Chechens understand|publisher= Pravda Report|date=12 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref> The Ministry of Sports found on 18 October that Kadyrov's promotion had violated regulations.

Between 2001 and 2014 Chechnya has received over 464 billion roubles in subsidies, grants and donations with federal subsidies accounting for 80% of the republic's budget (and this does not include funds allocated for infrastructure managed at federal level such as roads). However, the administration of Chechnya is being criticized for spending public funds for their personal benefit\u2014in 2010 [[Dmitry Medvedev]] noted that \"federal funds often do not reach people; we know where they disappear; it is obvious-they are being stolen\". For example, the fleet of official vehicles in Chechnya accounts for half of all official vehicles in all Northern Caucasus republics. Public funds are being funnelled through [[Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation]], which\u2014while being registered as a charity\u2014has never produced or published any financial reports as required by Russian law. These violations are ignored by [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Justice]], which in many cases has enforced them very strictly against other charities. The foundation operates a building company that services most of the publicly procured infrastructure projects in the republic and also collects a fee from all working citizens of Chechnya, ranging from 10 to 30% of their earnings, raising 3\u20134 billion roubles per year this way. Kadyrov himself declares annual income of 4.84 million roubles (2015), which is inconsistent with his lavish life-style, luxury vehicles, watches, race horses and mansions.<ref name=\"Yashin2016\">{{cite web |url=http://www.4freerussia.org/a-threat-to-national-security-download-the-english-ver/ |title=A Threat to National Security |accessdate=1 March 2016 |author=Yashin, Ilya}}</ref>\n\n== 2009 assassination attempt ==\nAn assassination attempt on Kadyrov and a parliament member [[Adam Delimkhanov]] was averted on 23 October 2009, by the police.

The conference was attended by notable Islamic scholars including the [[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]], [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]]; [[Grand Mufti]] of [[Egypt]], [[Shawki Allam]]; ex-Grand Mufti of Egypt [[Ali Gomaa]], Usama al-Azhari who is the religious adviser to [[Egyptian President]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]; [[Habib Ali al-Jifri]] and the [[mufti]] of [[Damascus]] Abdul Fattah al-Bizm. The conference was convened to discuss the alleged abuse of Islamic ideas to propagate extremism and to establish the criteria for determining who are the true followers of the [[Sunnah]]. The assembly of scholars issued a [[fatwa]] which declared that those who abide by the [[Kalam]], belong to the four [[Schools of Sunni law|madhhabs]] and follow the path of moral self-perfection espoused by distinguished Islamic teachers, primarily the [[Sufi]] [[Sheikh (Sufism)|sheikhs]], were the only true believers. The fatwa called the sect of [[Salafism]] as a \"dangerous and erroneous contemporary sect\", along with the extremist groups like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]. The conference also issued two further documents. In the first one, it appealed to President Vladimir Putin to ban Salafism and term any condemnation of \"[[traditional Islam]]\" as \"extremism\". It also proposed the fatwa be regarded as the considered opinion of \"leading Russian experts\" when evaluating the activity of Muslim organizations and the preaching of individual clerics. The second one issued a resolution calling for the establishment of a Council for Islamic Education and also a Council of [[Ulema]], which would rule on who is and is not a true follower of [[Sunni Islam]].<ref name=\"RfeRl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/caucasus-report-grozny-fatwa-controversy/27987472.html|title=Analysis: Grozny Fatwa On 'True Believers' Triggers Major Controversy|last1=Fuller|first1=Liz|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=14 September 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/soul-of-islam-uae-saudi-arabia-religion-gulf-countries/|title=UAE Vs.

Many of the key participants also disavowed the resolutions. Mukkadas Bibarsov, [[mufti]] of [[Saratov Oblast]] stated that the question of who was a true follower of Sunni Islam was resolved \"centuries ago\". He also added that the fatwa failed to take into account the crucial differences between Russia's Muslims, specifically that some Muslim communities did not follow [[Sufism]]. Liz Fuller writing for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] commented that the fatwa seemed to be giving permission to Kadyrov to take any action he likes to punish those whose religious views don't match with his own. Yaroslav Trofimov writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described it as a \"new fracture emerging within Islam\". Many Saudi clerics and citizens expressed outrage at the fatwa on social media. The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] expressed \"deep sorrow\" over the fatwa, stating that it \u201cignited fires of discord among Muslims around the world.\u201d<ref name=\"RfeRl\"/><ref name=\"WSJ\"/><ref name=\"TG\"/>\n\n=== Threats to Russian police officers ===\nIn 2015, Kadyrov ordered Chechen security forces to \u201cshoot to kill\u201d if they encountered [[Law enforcement in Russia|police officers]] from [[Federal subjects of Russia|other parts of Russia]] on the territory of the Chechen Republic.<ref name= \"moscow times\">\"[https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/kadyrov-authorizes-his-police-to-shoot-officers-from-other-parts-of-russia-46061 Kadyrov Authorizes His Police to Shoot Officers From Other Parts of Russia]\".

Three of Kadyrov's sons, all of them aged under 12, fought in the tournament with Kadyrov sitting in the audience and none of the fighters wearing any protective gear. One of the fights ended with a [[technical knockout]]. Kadyrov also posted images of the bouts on his Instagram account. The event caused an outcry especially against Ramzan allowing his children to compete in the tournament. [[Fedor Emelianenko]], the president of Russian MMA Union, criticised the event as \"inexcusable\", stating that rules stipulate fighters under the age of 21 have to wear protective gear while children under the age of 12 are not allowed to compete. Vadim Finkelstein, the head of MMA promotion [[M-1 Global]] also backed Fedor's comments. [[Dmitry Peskov]], the spokesperson for President Putin, stated that the fact that one of the fights between the children finished with a technical knockout was \u201ca reason for the appropriate oversight agencies to inquire about this incident.\u201d [[Ministry of Sport (Russia)|Deputy Minister of Sports]] [[Pavel Kolobkov]] stated that participation of children under the age of 12 in MMA competitions was illegal while stating that the incident was being investigated. Sports Minister [[Vitaly Mutko]] also stated that the event will be investigated.

The screenplay was written by [[Bridget O'Connor]] and [[Peter Straughan]], based on [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s 1974 [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy|novel of the same name]]. The film, starring [[Gary Oldman]] as [[George Smiley]], along with [[Colin Firth]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[John Hurt]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], and [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], and featuring [[David Dencik]], is set in London in the early 1970s and follows the hunt for a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[double agent]] at the top of the British secret service.\n\nThe film was produced through the British company [[Working Title Films]] and financed by France's [[StudioCanal]]. It premiered in competition at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]]. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing film at the British box office for three consecutive weeks. It won the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]]. The film also received three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and for Oldman, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].\n\nThe novel had previously been adapted into the award-winning 1979 [[BBC]] [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (miniseries)|miniseries of the same name]] with [[Alec Guinness]] playing the lead role of Smiley.\n\n==Plot==<!-- DO NOT ADD CAST NAMES INTO THIS SECTION. The cast list is already shown in the section below -->\nIn 1973, \"[[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\", head of [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]] (referred to as \"The Circus\"), sends agent [[Jim Prideaux]] to [[Budapest]] to meet a [[Hungarian People's Army|Hungarian Army]] general wishing to defect. The meeting is a trap, and Prideaux is shot by Hungarian agents who were actually planning to capture Prideaux, on behalf of the [[KGB]]. \n\nFollowing the botched assignment, Control and his right-hand man [[George Smiley]] are forced out of the agency. Smiley retires, but Control is murdered. \n\nPercy Alleline becomes the new Chief, [[Bill Haydon]] his deputy, and Roy Bland and [[Toby Esterhase]] his lieutenants. The four of them initiate an operation\u2014\"Witchcraft\"\u2014to obtain highly sensitive information from the [[Soviet Union]], which can then be traded to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Even before Control was ousted, he was suspicious of the Witchcraft operation\u2014Alleline went over his head to the [[Cabinet Office]] to get permission to proceed with it. \n\nSmiley's wife, Ann, has moved out.\n\nSome time later, Cabinet Office adviser Oliver Lacon is contacted by [[Ricki Tarr]], a former [[field agent]] suspected of going rogue. Tarr claims that there's a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] at the highest level of the Circus. Lacon asks Smiley to investigate the matter, and Smiley enlists the help of [[Peter Guillam]], Tarr's former [[case officer]], and [[Special Branch#United Kingdom|Special Branch]] officer Mendel. \n\nSmiley interviews [[Intelligence analysis|analyst]] Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after she deduced that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet [[cultural attach\u00e9]] in [[London]], was a spy.\n\nTarr comes out of hiding to talk to Smiley. In an extended flashback sequence, Tarr describes his assignment in [[Istanbul]]. At that time, he had an affair with a Soviet agent, Irina. Irina wanted to exchange the identity of the mole for [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. Tarr [[Diplomatic cable|cabled]] the Circus to tell them of Irina's offer, but the cable was not acted upon. Tarr then found his [[station chief]] murdered and realized that the mole must have intercepted his message. He tried to warn Irina, but she was captured by the Soviets. Fearing that the mole would try to have him killed also, Tarr went into hiding. \n\nIn the meantime, we discover that Prideaux is alive. We don\u2019t learn how he survived the shooting or how he got back, but we do learn that he is now a schoolteacher, living in a trailer.\n\nSmiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr cabled. Guillam  succeeds in obtaining the book, but while in the building is brought before Circus leadership. Alleline tells Guillam that Tarr is a traitor, that he\u2019s in London right now, and that someone has paid him 30,000 pounds. Guillam returns to Smiley, sees Tarr in the room and beats him bloody. Smiley checks the logbook and discovers that the pages for the night of the cable have been cut out, supporting Tarr's story.\n\nSmiley somehow discovers that Prideaux is alive and meets with him. Prideaux explains that he was delivered to the KGB, where he was beaten and tortured. His brutal [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|interrogation]] included watching a woman (Irina) executed right in front of him. Eventually, he was [[Prisoner exchange|exchanged]] with the Soviets. Prideaux tells Smiley that his mission in Hungary was to learn the identity of the mole, from the general, and relay it to Control via a [[code name]]: \"Tinker\" for Alleline, \"Tailor\" for Haydon, \"Soldier\" for Bland, \"Poorman\" for Esterhase, and \"Beggarman\" for Smiley.\n\nSmiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been meeting Polyakov\u2014the \"Witchcraft\" source\u2014at a [[safe house]] somewhere in London, and all four of them have been giving Polyakov \u201clow-grade\u201d British intelligence. Supposedly, Polyakov has been giving them high-grade Soviet intelligence in return. Which the British then share with the CIA in return for high-grade American intelligence. However, the Soviet intelligence is mostly a front\u2014just enough to keep the CIA involved\u2014and the mole (one of the four) has actually been passing to Polyakov substantive material, including high-grade British intelligence as well as the traded-for CIA intelligence, to Polyakov (the mole\u2019s [[Agent handler|handler]]).\n\nSmiley drives to an airfield with the Hungarian-born Esterhase and threatens to have him deported back to Hungary. Esterhase gives Smiley the safe house's location. Smiley then has Tarr go to the [[Paris]] station and cable London, claiming to know who the mole is. As planned, the mole intercepts the cable and stalls for time\u2014giving himself time to go to the safe house to alert Polyakov but accidentally confirming that the mole has intercepted the cable (again). Smiley is at the safe house, lying in wait, and captures the mole\u2014revealed to be Bill Haydon (Tailor).\n\nHaydon reveals that Prideaux, his best friend, told him about the operation in Hungary, which is how Prideaux was set up, and that it was Haydon who persuaded the Soviets to trade him back rather than kill him. Haydon also confesses that his affair with Ann Smiley was meant to deliberately cloud Smiley's judgment. Before Haydon can be traded to the Soviets, Prideaux kills him. Smiley comes home to find his wife in the kitchen, and he becomes the new head of the Circus.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[George Smiley]] (\"Beggarman\")\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[Bill Haydon]] (\"Tailor\")\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Ricki Tarr]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[Jim Prideaux]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Roy Bland (\"Soldier\")\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Peter Guillam]]\n* [[David Dencik]] as [[Toby Esterhase]] (\"Poorman\")\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as [[Gerald Westerby|Jerry Westerby]]\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Oliver Lacon\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Percy Alleline (\"Tinker\")\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\n* [[Kathy Burke]] as [[Connie Sachs]]\n* [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] as Mendel\n* [[Svetlana Khodchenkova]] as Irina\n* Arthur Nightingale as Bryant\n* [[John le Carr\u00e9]] as Christmas party guest\n* [[Christian McKay]] as Mackelvore\n* [[Konstantin Khabensky]] as Polyakov\n* [[Linda Marlowe]] as Mrs McCraig\n* [[Mike Sarne|Michael Sarne]] as [[Karla (character)|Karla]]\n* Tomasz Kowalski as Boris\n* [[Stuart Graham (actor)|Stuart Graham]] as Minister\n* [[Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi]] as Hungarian agent\n* [[Laura Carmichael]] as Sal\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe project was initiated by [[Peter Morgan]] when he wrote a draft of the screenplay, which he offered to Working Title Films to produce.

The screenplay was written by [[Bridget O'Connor]] and [[Peter Straughan]], based on [[John le Carr\u00e9]]'s 1974 [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy|novel of the same name]]. The film, starring [[Gary Oldman]] as [[George Smiley]], along with [[Colin Firth]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[John Hurt]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], and [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], and featuring [[David Dencik]], is set in London in the early 1970s and follows the hunt for a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[double agent]] at the top of the British secret service.\n\nThe film was produced through the British company [[Working Title Films]] and financed by France's [[StudioCanal]]. It premiered in competition at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]]. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing film at the British box office for three consecutive weeks. It won the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]]. The film also received three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and for Oldman, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].\n\nThe novel had previously been adapted into the award-winning 1979 [[BBC]] [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (miniseries)|miniseries of the same name]] with [[Alec Guinness]] playing the lead role of Smiley.\n\n==Plot==<!-- DO NOT ADD CAST NAMES INTO THIS SECTION. The cast list is already shown in the section below -->\nIn 1973, \"[[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\", head of [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]] (referred to as \"The Circus\"), sends agent [[Jim Prideaux]] to [[Budapest]] to meet a [[Hungarian People's Army|Hungarian Army]] general wishing to defect. The meeting is a trap, and Prideaux is shot by Hungarian agents who were actually planning to capture Prideaux, on behalf of the [[KGB]]. \n\nFollowing the botched assignment, Control and his right-hand man [[George Smiley]] are forced out of the agency. Smiley retires, but Control is murdered. \n\nPercy Alleline becomes the new Chief, [[Bill Haydon]] his deputy, and Roy Bland and [[Toby Esterhase]] his lieutenants. The four of them initiate an operation\u2014\"Witchcraft\"\u2014to obtain highly sensitive information from the [[Soviet Union]], which can then be traded to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Even before Control was ousted, he was suspicious of the Witchcraft operation\u2014Alleline went over his head to the [[Cabinet Office]] to get permission to proceed with it. \n\nSmiley's wife, Ann, is having an affair with Haydon and has moved out.\n\nSome time later, Cabinet Office adviser Oliver Lacon is contacted by [[Ricki Tarr]], a former [[field agent]] suspected of going rogue. Tarr claims that there's a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] at the highest level of the Circus. Lacon asks Smiley to investigate the matter, and Smiley enlists the help of [[Peter Guillam]], Tarr's former [[case officer]], and [[Special Branch#United Kingdom|Special Branch]] officer Mendel. \n\nSmiley interviews [[Intelligence analysis|analyst]] Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after she deduced that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet [[cultural attach\u00e9]] in [[London]], was a spy.\n\nTarr comes out of hiding to talk to Smiley. In an extended flashback sequence, Tarr describes his assignment in [[Istanbul]]. At that time, he had an affair with a Soviet agent, Irina. Irina wanted to exchange the identity of the mole for [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. Tarr [[Diplomatic cable|cabled]] the Circus to tell them of Irina's offer, but the cable was ignored. Tarr then found his [[station chief]] murdered and realized that the mole must have intercepted his message. He tried to warn Irina, but she was captured by the Soviets. Fearing that the mole would also try to have him killed, Tarr went into hiding. \n\nIn the meantime, we discover that Prideaux is alive. We don\u2019t learn how he survived the shooting, or how he got back, but we do learn that he is now a schoolteacher, living in a trailer.\n\nSmiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr cabled. Guilliam  succeeds in obtaining the book, but in the process was brought before Circus leadership. Alleline tells Guillam that Tarr is a traitor, that he\u2019s in London right now, and that someone has paid him 30,000 pounds. Guilliam returns to Smiley, sees Tarr in the room and beats him bloody. Smiley checks the logbook and discovers that the pages for the night of the cable have been cut out, supporting Tarr's story.\n\nSmiley discovers that Prideaux is alive, and meets with him. Prideaux explains that he was delivered to the KGB, where he was beaten and tortured. His brutal [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|interrogation]] included watching a woman executed right in front of him (Irina). Eventually, he was [[Prisoner exchange|exchanged]] with the Soviets. Prideaux tells Smiley that his mission in Hungary was to learn the identity of the mole, from the general, and relay it to Control via a [[code name]]: \"Tinker\" for Alleline, \"Tailor\" for Haydon, \"Soldier\" for Bland, \"Poorman\" for Esterhase, and \"Beggarman\" for Smiley.\n\nSmiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been meeting Polyakov\u2014the \"Witchcraft\" source\u2014at a [[safe house]] somewhere in London, and all four of them have been giving Polyakov \u201clow-grade\u201d British intelligence. Supposedly, Polyakov has been giving them high-grade Soviet intelligence in return. Which the British then share with the CIA in return for high-grade American intelligence. However, the Soviet intelligence is mostly a front\u2014just enough to keep the CIA involved\u2014and the mole (one of the four) has actually been passing to Polyakov substantive material, including high-grade British intelligence as well as the traded-for CIA intelligence, to Polyakov (the mole\u2019s [[Agent handler|handler]]).\n\nSmiley captures the Hungarian-born Esterhase, and threatens to have him deported back to Hungary. Esterhase gives Smiley the safe house's location. Smiley then has Tarr go to the [[Paris]] station and cable London, claiming to know who the mole is. As planned, the mole intercepts the cable and stalls for time\u2014giving him time to go to the safe house to alert Polyakov but accidentally confirming that the mole has intercepted the cable (again). Smiley is there, lying in wait, and captures the mole\u2014revealed to be Bill Haydon (Tailor).\n\nHaydon reveals that Prideaux, his best friend, told him about the operation in Hungary, which is how Prideaux was set up, and that it was Haydon who persuaded the Soviets to trade him back rather than kill him. Haydon also confesses that his affair with Ann was meant to deliberately cloud Smiley's judgment. Before Haydon can be traded to the Soviets, Prideaux kills him. Smiley and Ann get back together, and Smiley becomes the new head of the Circus.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[George Smiley]] (\"Beggarman\")\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[Bill Haydon]] (\"Tailor\")\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Ricki Tarr]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[Jim Prideaux]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Roy Bland (\"Soldier\")\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Peter Guillam]]\n* [[David Dencik]] as [[Toby Esterhase]] (\"Poorman\")\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as [[Gerald Westerby|Jerry Westerby]]\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Oliver Lacon\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Percy Alleline (\"Tinker\")\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\n* [[Kathy Burke]] as [[Connie Sachs]]\n* [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] as Mendel\n* [[Svetlana Khodchenkova]] as Irina\n* Arthur Nightingale as Bryant\n* [[John le Carr\u00e9]] as Christmas party guest\n* [[Christian McKay]] as Mackelvore\n* [[Konstantin Khabensky]] as Polyakov\n* [[Linda Marlowe]] as Mrs McCraig\n* [[Mike Sarne|Michael Sarne]] as [[Karla (character)|Karla]]\n* Tomasz Kowalski as Boris\n* [[Stuart Graham (actor)|Stuart Graham]] as Minister\n* [[Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi]] as Hungarian agent\n* [[Laura Carmichael]] as Sal\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe project was initiated by [[Peter Morgan]] when he wrote a draft of the screenplay, which he offered to Working Title Films to produce.
