The film is loosely based on the first and second stories of the third day of ''[[The Decameron]]'', a collection of novellas by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. It stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Alison Brie]], [[Dave Franco]], [[Kate Micucci]], [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[John C. Reilly]], and [[Molly Shannon]].\n\nSet in the [[14th century]], the film is told in an anachronistic style, with contemporary dialogue and behavior. The plot jointly follows the lives of three nuns at a convent located in the countryside who encounter a young gardener posing as a [[deaf-mute]]. The film held its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 2017 and was released on June 30, 2017, by Gunpowder & Sky. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the cast's performances.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 1347 in [[Garfagnana]], a convent of nuns is led by Father Tommasso. The nuns include Alessandra, who wants a better life for herself and is held at the convent due to her father's support of the church rather than her own bidding; Ginevra, a gossip who is later revealed to be a lesbian and Jewish; and Fernanda, an emotionally unstable and violent woman. The three of them routinely assault the gardener Lurco, who quits in disgust. Meanwhile, in [[Lunigiana]], a young servant named Massetto gets caught having sexual relations with his master's wife. While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him return home and the two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a [[deaf-mute]], in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble. \n\nFernanda's friend Marta appears and encourages Alessandra and Ginevra to get drunk off the sacramental wine while explaining how being with a man is the greatest possible pleasure. Fernanda takes Ginevra back to her room where they have sex. Massetto and Alessandra begin to form a closer bond while Ginevra begins to have feelings for Fernanda.\n\nLater, Fernanda kidnaps Massetto at knife-point and takes him into the forest, where she meets up with a [[coven]] of [[witches]]. She attempts to perform a fertility ritual with Massetto but is stopped by the arrival of Alessandra and Ginevra. Ginevra, under the hallucinogenic effects of [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], takes off her clothes and begins dancing and steals the convent's donkey. Massetto reveals that he is not a deaf-mute while trying to free himself. They return to the convent, and all of their secrets are revealed in the presence of the visiting Bishop Bartolomeo. Father Tommasso is sent away to become a monk after it is discovered that he and the Mother Superior are in love and have a secret relationship. Massetto is returned to his master and is held in a jail cell with the impending threat of torture and death until the three nuns (who have reconciled and formed an even stronger friendship) help him escape. While Alessandra, Massetto, Ginevra, and Fernanda each run hand-in-hand back to the convent, the Mother Superior and Father Tommasso have met up in secret under the pretense that the Mother Superior has gone to retrieve the donkey. They hide as the nuns and Massetto run by. Fernanda stops and stares in puzzlement at the once again freed donkey that she herself used as an excuse so many times to escape the convent, until Ginevra pulls her away. With the group gone, Father Tommasso and Mother Superior embrace and smile at each other.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast listed in cast end credits please do not change-->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Sister Alessandra \n* [[Dave Franco]] as Masseto\n* [[Kate Micucci]] as Sister Ginevra\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Sister Fernanda \n* [[John C.

While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him return home and the two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a [[deaf-mute]], in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble. \n\nFernanda's friend Marta appears and encourages Alessandra and Ginevra to get drunk off the sacramental wine while explaining how being with a man is the greatest possible pleasure. Fernanda takes Ginevra back to her room where they have sex. Massetto and Alessandra begin to form a closer bond while Ginevra begins to have feelings for Fernanda.\n\nLater, Fernanda kidnaps Massetto at knife-point and takes him into the forest, where she meets up with a [[coven]] of [[witches]]. She attempts to perform a fertility ritual with Massetto but is stopped by the arrival of Alessandra and Ginevra. Ginevra, under the hallucinogenic effects of [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], takes off her clothes and begins dancing and steals the convent's donkey. Massetto reveals that he is not a deaf-mute while trying to free himself. They return to the convent, and all of their secrets are revealed in the presence of the visiting Bishop Bartolomeo. Father Tommasso is sent away to become a monk after it is discovered that he and the Mother Superior are in love and have a secret relationship. Massetto is returned to his master and is held in a jail cell with the impending threat of torture and death until the three nuns (who have reconciled and formed an even stronger friendship) help him escape. While Alessandra, Massetto, Ginevra, and Fernanda each run hand-in-hand back to the convent, the Mother Superior and Father Tommasso have met up in secret under the pretense that the Mother Superior has gone to retrieve the donkey. They hide as the nuns and Massetto run by. Fernanda stops and stares in puzzlement at the once again freed donkey that she herself used as an excuse so many times to escape the convent, until Ginevra pulls her away. With the group gone, Father Tommasso and Mother Superior embrace and smile at each other.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast listed in cast end credits please do not change-->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Sister Alessandra \n* [[Dave Franco]] as Masseto\n* [[Kate Micucci]] as Sister Ginevra\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Sister Fernanda \n* [[John C.

It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition from receiving [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]]. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], Barclay DeVeau, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Kerrigan Mahan]], [[Natasha Melnick]], [[Garrett Morris]], [[Tamera Mowry]] and [[Lisa Wilhoit]]. The episode won an [[Annie Award]] for \"Writing in an Animated Television Production.\"\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mayor West|Mayor Adam West]] deploys the entire Quahog Police Department to [[Cartagena, Colombia]] to search for Elaine Wilder (a fictional character from the film ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' which he was watching), leaving [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] behind (as he was not deployed due to his disability and the fact that parts of Cartagena aren't wheelchair-accessible) with the police station's [[skeleton crew]]. [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] join the department to assist Joe.\n\nMeanwhile, Meg threatens to commit [[suicide]] because she does not have a date for her Junior Prom. Even her backup boy turned her down by shooting his little brother and having to attend his funeral. As a last resort, Brian agrees to take her to the prom. He gets [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]] there, defends Meg by insulting Connie D'Amico about her inevitable future, and the two [[making out|make out]]. After the dance, Meg begins to think Brian is her boyfriend, despite Brian saying he has no feelings for her and citing his already existing relationship with Jillian. Meg develops an [[obsessive love|obsession]] with Brian, even baking him a pie and using her hair as one of the ingredients. Stewie arrives and sits next to Brian and asks if he can have some pie. He then asks for the \"[[Cool Whip|Cool Hwip]]\" (this is the first in a series of occasions where Stewie puts [[wikt:emphasis|emphasis]] on the \"h\" sound in a word starting with \"wh\"). Brian soon works up the courage to tell Lois that he and Meg kissed. Lois gets enraged at the news, and orders Brian to straighten it out.\n\nBrian goes up to Meg's room and tells her he's not attracted to her. However, Meg refuses to take \"No\" for an answer. Later that night, she knocks Brian out, puts him in the trunk of his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with packaging tape and is about to [[sexual assault|rape]] him. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an [[eroticism|erotic]] tone) \"I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her.\" This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says \"Soon it'll all become clear\", puts on [[seduction|seductive]] music, dims the lights, strips down to a [[speedo]] and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of ''[[The Missing Piece (book)|The Missing Piece]]'' to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his [[one-night stand]]s await with an array of [[sex toy]]s, and it turns out that all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [[whip|hwip]] (with emphasis on the \"h\") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.\n\nDuring the credits, Tom Tucker reports that the Quahog Police have called off the search for Elaine Wilder and are heading back to Quahog.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Kirker Butler by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Kirker Butler wrote the episode.]]\nA scene shows Cleveland falling out of the bathtub and subsequently out of his house. This is the second time the show has used this gag (as indicated when Cleveland comments that \"I gotta stop taking baths during Peter's shenanigans\"), the first one being \"[[Hell Comes to Quahog]]\", where Peter blew up Cleveland's house with a tank. This gag occurred three more times in the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh season]] episodes \"[[Tales of a Third Grade Nothing]]\" and \"[[Family Gay]]\", the [[Family Guy (season 8)|season eight]] episodes \"[[Spies Reminiscent of Us]]\", \"[[Brian's Got a Brand New Bag]]\", and the [[Pilot (The Cleveland Show)|''Cleveland Show'' pilot]].

After the dance, Meg begins to think Brian is her boyfriend, despite Brian saying he has no feelings for her and citing his already existing relationship with Jillian. Meg develops an [[obsessive love|obsession]] with Brian, even baking him a pie and using her hair as one of the ingredients. Stewie arrives and sits next to Brian and asks if he can have some pie. He then asks for the \"[[Cool Whip|Cool Hwip]]\" (this is the first in a series of occasions where Stewie puts [[wikt:emphasis|emphasis]] on the \"h\" sound in a word starting with \"wh\"). Brian soon works up the courage to tell Lois that he and Meg kissed. Lois gets enraged at the news, and orders Brian to straighten it out.\n\nBrian goes up to Meg's room and tells her he's not attracted to her. However, Meg refuses to take \"No\" for an answer. Later that night, she knocks Brian out, puts him in the trunk of his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with packaging tape and is about to [[sexual assault|rape]] him. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an [[eroticism|erotic]] tone) \"I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her.\" This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says \"Soon it'll all become clear\", puts on [[seduction|seductive]] music, dims the lights, strips down to a [[speedo]] and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of ''[[The Missing Piece (book)|The Missing Piece]]'' to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his [[one-night stand]]s await with an array of [[sex toy]]s, and it turns out that all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [[whip|hwip]] (with emphasis on the \"h\") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.\n\nDuring the credits, Tom Tucker reports that the Quahog Police have called off the search for Elaine Wilder and are heading back to Quahog.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Kirker Butler by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Kirker Butler wrote the episode.]]\nA scene shows Cleveland falling out of the bathtub and subsequently out of his house.

Over time, the AASE established uniform listing rules, broker rules, and commission rates.\n\nTrading was conducted by a call system, where an exchange employee called the names of each company and brokers bid or offered on each.  In the 1960s, this changed to a post system.

In the 1850s Victoria was Australia's gold mining centre, its population increasing from 80,000 in 1851 to 540,000 in 1861.\n\n'''1871''': Thirty years after it lit the first gas street light in Sydney, [[Australian Gas Light Company|AGL]] took its place in history again, becoming the second company to list on the Sydney Stock Exchange.\n\n'''1885''': Two years after the Broken Hill Mining Company (private company) was established by a syndicate of seven men from the Mt Gipps sheep station, the company was incorporated to become the [[BHP|Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited]] (BHP). In 1885, BHP listed on the Melbourne Stock Exchange.\n\n'''1937''': The Australian Associated Stock Exchanges (AASE) was established in 1937. Since 1903 the state stock exchanges had met on an informal basis, but in 1936 Sydney took the lead in formalising the association. Initially, this involved the exchanges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Sydney. Melbourne and Perth joined soon after. Through the AASE the exchanges gradually brought in common listing requirements for companies and uniform brokerage and other rules for stockbroking firms. They also set the ground rules for commissions and the flotation of government and semi-government loan raisings.\n[[File:Sydney Exchange Centre.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sydney Exchange Square]]\n[[File:Sydney Exchange Square entrance.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sydney Exchange Square entrance]]\n'''1938''': Publication of the first share price index.\n\n'''1939''': Sydney Stock Exchange closed for the first time due to the declaration of [[World War II]].\n\n'''1960''': Sydney Futures Exchange began trading as Sydney Greasy Wool Futures Exchange (SGWFE). Its original goal was to provide Australian wool traders with hedging facilities in their own country. SGWFE offered a single contract of greasy wool that by the end of the year had traded 19,042 lots.\n\n'''1969\u20131970''': The [[Poseidon bubble]] (a mining boom triggered by a nickel discovery in Western Australia) caused Australian mining shares to soar and then crash, prompting regulatory recommendations that ultimately led to Australia's national companies and securities legislation.\n\n'''1976''': The Australian Options Market was established, trading [[call option]]s.\n\n'''1980''': The separate Melbourne and Sydney stock exchange indices were replaced by Australian Stock Exchange indices.\n\n'''1984''': Brokers' commission rates were deregulated. Commissions have gradually fallen ever since, with rates today as low as 0.12% or 0.05% from discount internet-based brokers.\n\n'''1984''': Sydney Stock Exchange closed due to heavy rain and flooding on Friday 9 November 1984 with 70 millimetres of rain falling in one half-hour. All trading on the floor of the Sydney Exchange was suspended throughout Friday. Damage totaled $2 million and repairs took more than six months, with new carpet laid and cables and computers replaced.\n\nStockbrokers who had taken advantage of joint access were able to trade on the Melbourne Stock Exchange. And, with the Sydney trading floor closed by floodwaters, the Melbourne Exchange enjoyed its busiest trading day for the year. After that episode a back-up site was established outside the Sydney CBD.\n\n'''1987''': The Australian Stock Exchange Limited (ASX) was formed on 1 April 1987, through incorporation under legislation of the Australian Parliament. The formation of the national stock exchange involved the amalgamation of the six independent stock exchanges that had operated in the states' capital cities.\n\nThe launch of the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). It was a far cry from the original system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based call system, which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each listed security in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It was replaced by the 'post' system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on 'posts' or 'boards'. 'Chalkies' were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the bids and offers of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1991.\n\n'''1990''': A [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]] market was established.\n\n'''1993''': Fixed-interest securities were added (see [[#Interest rate market|Interest rate market]] below). Also in 1993, the FAST system of accelerated settlement was established, and the following year the CHESS system (see [[#Settlement|Settlement]] below) was introduced, superseding FAST.\n\n'''1994''': The Sydney Futures Exchange announced trading in [[Futures contract|futures]] over individual ASX stocks. The ASX responded with the [[Low Exercise Price Option]] or LEPO (see below). The SFE went to court,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1994/1450.html|title=SFE Ltd v ASX Ltd |accessdate=30 August 2010 |publisher=[[Federal Court of Australia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1995/1106.html |title=SFE Ltd v ASX Ltd and ASC (Intervener) |accessdate=30 August 2010 |publisher=[[Federal Court of Australia]]}}</ref> claiming that LEPOs were futures and therefore that the ASX could not offer them. However, the court held they were options and so LEPOs were introduced in 1995.\n\n'''1995''': [[Stamp duty]] on share transactions was halved from 0.3% to 0.15%. The ASX had agreed with the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland State Government]] to locate staff in [[Brisbane]] in exchange for the stamp duty reduction there, and the other states followed suit so as not to lose brokerage business to Queensland. In 2000 stamp duty was abolished in all states as part of the introduction of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]].\n\n'''1996''': The exchange members (brokers etc.) voted to [[Demutualization|demutualise]]. The exchange was incorporated as ASX Limited and in 1998 the company was listed on the ASX itself, with the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] enforcing the listing rules for ASX Limited.\n\n'''1997''': Electronic trading commences as the option market moves from floor to screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asx.com.au/documents/resources/fund_managers_handbook.pdf |title=Guide to Equity Options for Investment Managers}}</ref> A phased transition to the electronic CLICK system for derivatives began.\n\n'''1998''': ASX demutualised to become a listed company.

In the 1850s Victoria was Australia's gold mining centre, its population increasing from 80,000 in 1851 to 540,000 in 1861.\n\n'''1871''': Thirty years after it lit the first gas street light in Sydney, [[Australian Gas Light Company|AGL]] took its place in history again, becoming the second company to list on the Sydney Stock Exchange.\n\n'''1885''': Two years after the Broken Hill Mining Company (private company) was established by a syndicate of seven men from the Mt Gipps sheep station, the company was incorporated to become the [[BHP|Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited]] (BHP). In 1885, BHP listed on the Melbourne Stock Exchange.\n\n'''1937''': The Australian Associated Stock Exchanges (AASE) was established in 1937. Since 1903 the state stock exchanges had met on an informal basis, but in 1936 Sydney took the lead in formalising the association. Initially, this involved the exchanges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Sydney. Melbourne and Perth joined soon after. Through the AASE the exchanges gradually brought in common listing requirements for companies and uniform brokerage and other rules for stockbroking firms. They also set the ground rules for commissions and the flotation of government and semi-government loan raisings.\n[[File:Sydney Exchange Centre.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sydney Exchange Square]]\n[[File:Sydney Exchange Square entrance.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sydney Exchange Square entrance]]\n'''1938''': Publication of the first share price index.\n\n'''1939''': Sydney Stock Exchange closed for the first time due to the declaration of [[World War II]].\n\n'''1960''': Sydney Futures Exchange began trading as Sydney Greasy Wool Futures Exchange (SGWFE). Its original goal was to provide Australian wool traders with hedging facilities in their own country. SGWFE offered a single contract of greasy wool that by the end of the year had traded 19,042 lots.\n\n'''1969\u20131970''': The [[Poseidon bubble]] (a mining boom triggered by a nickel discovery in Western Australia) caused Australian mining shares to soar and then crash, prompting regulatory recommendations that ultimately led to Australia's national companies and securities legislation.\n\n'''1976''': The Australian Options Market was established, trading [[call option]]s.\n\n'''1980''': The separate Melbourne and Sydney stock exchange indices were replaced by Australian Stock Exchange indices.\n\n'''1984''': Brokers' commission rates were deregulated. Commissions have gradually fallen ever since, with rates today as low as 0.12% or 0.05% from discount internet-based brokers.\n\n'''1984''': Sydney Stock Exchange closed due to heavy rain and flooding on Friday 9 November 1984 with 70 millimetres of rain falling in one half-hour. All trading on the floor of the Sydney Exchange was suspended throughout Friday. Damage totaled $2 million and repairs took more than six months, with new carpet laid and cables and computers replaced.\n\nStockbrokers who had taken advantage of joint access were able to trade on the Melbourne Stock Exchange. And, with the Sydney trading floor closed by floodwaters, the Melbourne Exchange enjoyed its busiest trading day for the year. After that episode a back-up site was established outside the Sydney CBD.\n\n'''1987''': The Australian Stock Exchange Limited (ASX) was formed on 1 April 1987, through incorporation under legislation of the Australian Parliament. The formation of the national stock exchange involved the amalgamation of the six independent stock exchanges that had operated in the states' capital cities.\n\nThe launch of the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). It was a far cry from the original system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based call system, which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each listed security in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It was replaced by the 'post' system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on 'posts' or 'boards'. 'Chalkies' were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the bids and offers of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1991.\n\n'''1990''': A [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]] market was established.\n\n'''1993''': Fixed-interest securities were added (see [[#Interest rate market|Interest rate market]] below). Also in 1993, the FAST system of accelerated settlement was established, and the following year the CHESS system (see [[#Settlement|Settlement]] below) was introduced, superseding FAST.\n\n'''1994''': The Sydney Futures Exchange announced trading in [[Futures contract|futures]] over individual ASX stocks. The ASX responded with the [[Low Exercise Price Option]] or LEPO (see below). The SFE went to court,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1994/1450.html|title=SFE Ltd v ASX Ltd |accessdate=30 August 2010 |publisher=[[Federal Court of Australia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1995/1106.html |title=SFE Ltd v ASX Ltd and ASC (Intervener) |accessdate=30 August 2010 |publisher=[[Federal Court of Australia]]}}</ref> claiming that LEPOs were futures and therefore that the ASX could not offer them. However, the court held they were options and so LEPOs were introduced in 1995.\n\n'''1995''': [[Stamp duty]] on share transactions was halved from 0.3% to 0.15%. The ASX had agreed with the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland State Government]] to locate staff in [[Brisbane]] in exchange for the stamp duty reduction there, and the other states followed suit so as not to lose brokerage business to Queensland. In 2000 stamp duty was abolished in all states as part of the introduction of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]].\n\n'''1996''': The exchange members (brokers etc.) voted to [[Demutualization|demutualise]].

ASX Trade is a NASDAQ OMX ultra-low latency trading platform based on NASDAQ OMX's Genium INET system, which is used by many exchanges around the world.  It is one of the fastest and most functional multi-asset trading platforms in the world, delivering latency down to ~250 microseconds.\n\nASX Trade24 is ASX global trading platform for derivatives.  It is globally distributed with network access points (gateways) located in Chicago, New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Melbourne. It also allows for true 24-hour trading, and simultaneously maintains two active trading days which enables products to be opened for trading in the new trading day in one time zone while products are still trading under the previous day.\n\n;Opening times\n\nThe normal trading or business days of the ASX are week-days, Monday to Friday. ASX does not trade on national public holidays: [[New Year's Day]] (1 January), [[Australia Day]] (26 January, and observed on this day or the first business day after this date), [[Good Friday]] (that varies each year), [[Easter Monday]], [[Anzac Day|Anzac day]] (25 April), Queen's birthday (June), [[Christmas Day]] (25 December) and [[Boxing Day]] (26 December).\n\nOn each trading day there is a [[Extended-hours trading|pre-market]] session from 7:00am to 10:00am [[AEST]] and a normal trading session from 10:00am to 4:00pm AEST. The market opens alphabetically in [[single-price auction]]s, phased over the first ten minutes, with a small random time built in to prevent exact prediction of the first trades. There is also a single-price auction between 4:10pm and 4:11pm to set the daily closing prices.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Settlement ==\nSecurity holders hold shares in one of two forms, both of which operate as uncertificated holdings, rather than through the issue of physical [[share certificate]]s:\n\n* Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System (CHESS). The investor's controlling participant (normally a broker) sponsors the client into CHESS. The security holder is given a \"holder identification number\" (HIN) and monthly statements are sent to the security holder from the CHESS system when there is a movement in their holding that month.\n* Issuer-sponsored. The company's share register administers the security holder's holding and issues the investor with a security-holder reference number (SRN) which may be quoted when selling.\n\nHoldings may be moved from issuer-sponsored to CHESS or between different brokers by electronic message initiated by the controlling participant.\n\n== Short selling ==\n{{Main|Short (finance)}}\nShort selling of shares is permitted on the ASX, but only among designated stocks and with certain conditions:\n\n* ASX trading participants (brokers) must report all daily gross short sales to ASX. The report will aggregate the gross short sales as reported by each trading participant at an individual stock level.\n* ASX publishes aggregate gross short sales to ASX participants and the general public.<ref>[http://www.asx.com.au/data/shortsell.txt \"Requirements for disclosure and reporting of short sales\"], ASX, 19 November 2008</ref>\n\nMany brokers do not offer short selling to small private investors.

The rule requires that if a Failed Settlement Shortfall exists on the second business day after the day on which the Rescheduled Batch Instruction was originally scheduled for settlement (that is, generally on T+5), the delivering settlement participant must either:\n* close out the Failed Settlement Shortfall on the next business day by purchasing the number of Financial Products of the relevant class equal to the shortfall; or\n* acquire under a [[securities lending]] arrangement the number of Financial Products of the relevant class equal to the shortfall and deliver those Financial Products in Batch Settlement no more than two business days later.<ref>[http://www.asx.com.au/compliance/rules_guidance/asxl/asx_gn37_maintenance_of_an_orderly_market.pdf \"ASX Market Rules - Maintenance of an orderly market when closing out settlement \"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120130448/http://asx.com.au/compliance/rules_guidance/asxl/asx_gn37_maintenance_of_an_orderly_market.pdf |date=20 November 2010 }}, ASX,  20 February 2010</ref>\n\n== Options ==\n[[Option (finance)|Options]] on leading shares are traded on the ASX, with standardised sets of strike prices and expiry dates. Liquidity is provided by market makers who are required to provide quotes. Each market maker is assigned two or more stocks. A stock can have more than one market maker, and they compete with one another. A market maker may choose one or both of:\n\n* Make a market continuously, on a set of 18 options.\n* Make a market in response to a quote request, in any option up to 9 months out.\n\nIn both cases there is a minimum quantity (5 or 10 contracts depending on the shares) and a maximum spread permitted.\n\nDue to the higher risks in options, brokers must check clients' suitability before allowing them to trade options. Clients may both take (i.e. buy) and write (i.e. sell) options. For written positions, the client must put up [[Margin (finance)|margin]].\n\n== Interest rate market ==\nThe ASX interest rate market is the set of [[corporate bond]]s, [[floating rate note]]s, and bond-like [[Preferred stock|preference shares]] listed on the exchange. These securities are traded and settled in the same way as ordinary shares, but the ASX provides information such as their maturity, effective interest rate, etc., to aid comparison.<ref>{{cite web|title=Headlights on trading and investment |url=http://www.apsec.com.au/trading.html}} {{cite web|title=APSEC|url=http://www.apsec.com.au}}Australian Securities Exchange.

The series follows the adventures of four penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private, who perform various commando-like missions to protect their home in the [[Central Park Zoo]]. The penguins often have to deal with problems caused, or made worse, by their zoo neighbors, King Julien XIII (a [[ring-tailed lemur]]), Maurice (an [[aye-aye]]), and Mort (a [[mouse lemur]]).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes}}\n{{:List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes}}\n<!-- To edit the content in this section you need to edit [[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes]] -->\n\n==Characters==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n''The Penguins of Madagascar'' features the four penguin characters from the ''Madagascar'' franchise, as well as the two chimpanzees and the three lemurs. Characters new to the franchise include Marlene the otter and Alice the zookeeper, among others. In addition, [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]], [[John DiMaggio]], [[Andy Richter]], and [[Conrad Vernon]] reprise their roles as Skipper, Rico, Mort, and Mason respectively.\n\nAll four of the penguin characters are designed differently in the cartoon than they are in the movie to make them more distinguishable and easier to tell apart. Skipper's head is flatter in the series; Kowalski is taller; Rico has an unexplained scar over his mouth, a double chin, and a feathery Mohawk; and Private is shorter, younger, and rounder. Their personalities and abilities were also exaggerated. The texture of the characters was also changed to be better suited for television work.<ref name=awm/>\n\n===Main===\n<!--Please do not add any characters that aren't designated as main characters. Single episode characters aren't needed here. Main characters are ordered per the closing credits of S1E1 (McGrath, DiMaggio, Bennett, Stuart. This ordering should not be changed without a new consensus.-->\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Skipper|Skipper]] (voiced by [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]])&nbsp;\u2013 Skipper is the leader of the penguins. He devises tactics and gives orders. Calculating, strict, energetic, paranoid, short-tempered and nearly unflappable, Skipper's raving paranoia and tendency to view even the most ordinary activities as a military operation, combined with his experience in covert ops, has driven him to prepare for nearly any situation, no matter how bizarre or unlikely. It is revealed in the episode \"Needle Point\" that Skipper is afraid of needles. McGrath reprises his role from the films.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Kowalski|Kowalski]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 Kowalski acts as the group strategist and gadgeteer. Kowalski is a brilliant inventor, but he cannot read (although he does carry around a clipboard upon which he records drawings of their plans). He also tends to over-analyze situations and has created many amazing devices which have put the team in danger. It is revealed in the episode \"Needle Point\" that he is afraid of going to the dentist.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Rico|Rico]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])&nbsp;\u2013 Rico is the team's weapons and explosives specialist, who mainly communicates through grunts and squeals, but sometimes he can speak rather normally. Slightly unhinged, Rico swallows useful tools, such as dynamite, and regurgitates them when needed, to the point of regularly regurgitating objects that appear to be too large for him to have swallowed in the first place. He has been referred to as a psychopath in several episodes. He is shown in some episodes to be in a relationship with a female doll called Miss Perky. DiMaggio reprises his role from the films. \n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Private|Private]] (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]])&nbsp;\u2013 Private is the emotionally sensitive, British-accented rookie of the group. Though younger and less experienced than the other penguins, he is the most down to earth; Private tends to offer simpler, more commonsense solutions in response to Skipper and Kowalski's complex strategies, often in an understated tone while those strategies are falling apart (''e.g.'', \"The Officer X Factor\"). He often shows an eager interest in unicorns, as evidenced by his love of a show called \"The Lunacorns\" (''e.g.'', \"Hello, Dollface\", \"Operation: Lunacorn Apocalypse\"), for which he is often ridiculed. Private is also a skilled fighter.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#King Julien|King Julien XIII]] (voiced by [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]])&nbsp;\u2013 Normally shortened to King Julien, King Julien XIII is a fun loving, witty, narcissistic [[ring-tailed lemur]]. The King of the Lemurs is a comically conceited character who has little regard for others, even his subjects. He has a tendency to use [[malapropism]]s and misinterpret [[figures of speech]]. King Julien considers himself to be king over all animals he encounters, but is oblivious to their dislike of him. He is very lazy, childish, immature, dim-witted, and spoiled to the point where he will not offer assistance to ensure his own safety. He is also very proud of his bottom, which he refers to as \"The Royal Booty\".\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Maurice|Maurice]] (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]])&nbsp;\u2013 Maurice is an [[aye-aye]] who is one of King Julien's subjects. Maurice accepts his life as a servant, but he often shows disdain towards King Julien and his inconsiderate attitude. He seems to be aware of human activities and inventions, even though he has spent most of his life away from human civilization.\n*[[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mort|Mort]] (voiced by [[Andy Richter]])&nbsp;\u2013 Mort is an excitable, dimwitted, accident-prone [[mouse lemur]]. Unlike Maurice, Mort is fiercely devoted to Julien, even displaying an obsession with the lemur king's feet. King Julien treats him with contempt. He is considered to be the cutest animal in the zoo, which upsets Private. Mort is occasionally enlisted to help the penguins due to his small size or cuteness. Richter reprises his role from the films.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Marlene|Marlene]] (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]; [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in wild form)&nbsp;\u2013 Marlene is a female [[otter]]<!--Any change from \"otter\" to a specific type of otter requires a citation --> who was transferred to the Central Park Zoo from the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]].<ref name=awm/> She is close friends with Skipper and sometimes tags along on his missions, but she is often a neutral character who does not take sides between the penguins and the lemurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/shows/penguins-of-madagascar/characters/marlene.html |title=Marlene from Penguins of Madagascar |publisher=[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> By being a levelheaded, feminine voice of reason, she is a counterpoint to Skipper's masculine, covert-ops character. Since she was born in captivity, once she sets out of the confines of the zoo, she goes wild as she cannot cope with the lack of boundaries. Later after Kowalski separated her wild side, she becomes afraid as her feral side roams over the city. The penguins later put the two Marlenes back together and Marlene is able to control her wild side. In \"Popcorn Panic\", a brief shot of the zoo map reveals her enclosure to be that of an \"Asian Otter\".\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Mason]] (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Phil]]&nbsp;\u2013 Mason and Phil are two intelligent [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s. Mason can speak and is very civilized and refined. Phil is [[Muteness|mute]], but is the only animal in the zoo that can read. Phil is often asked to read something, and then he communicates the message to Mason through [[sign language]]<ref name=awm/> which is interpreted by Mason. Different episodes indicate that they are highly intelligent, but they are not openly aware of this themselves. Phil is considered for involvement with a space exploration program. Vernon reprises his role from the films.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Roger|Roger]] (voiced by [[Richard Kind]])&nbsp;\u2013 Roger is the penguins' [[alligator]] friend [[Sewer alligator|who lives in the sewer]]. They meet him in the episode \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep3|Haunted Habitat]]\" when Skipper and Marlene go to investigate in the sewer under Marlene's habitat because of a strange sound. Roger tells the penguins that he is from Florida. He appears again in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep25|Roger Dodger]]\" when the sewer rats terrorize him and in \"Gator Watch\" when he wants a new home, eventually being captured and sent to the zoo.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Max|Max / \"Moon-cat\"]] (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]])&nbsp;\u2013 Max is the penguins' stray [[cat]] friend. He first meets the four penguins in the episode \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep2|Launchtime]]\" when the penguins end up on a rooftop across the street from the zoo instead of on the moon. At first, the penguins thought he was a \"moon-cat\" but at the end they figure out he was a stray cat, but they still refer to Max as \"Moon-cat\" out of habit. Max is skinny and hopes to catch a bird in his life. He at first wanted to eat the penguins, but was so touched when they gave him a can of fish that he became their friend instead. He appeared again in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep28|Cat's Cradle]]\", in which he tried to hide from Officer X from Animal Control.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Joey|Joey]] (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]] in an Australian accent) is an anti-social [[kangaroo]] with a passion for boxing. He is extremely possessive of his habitat. Most of his comments refer to physically hurting the subject of discussion.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Bada and Bing|Bada and Bing]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]])&nbsp;\u2013 Bada and Bing are two [[gorilla]]s who enjoy fighting. They once beat up Mort, which led to Mort growing after he was thrown into Kowalski's latest invention, and they then got beat up by Mort to get a mango. Julien once gave them lots of bananas but it is possible that they beat him up due to him giving too much to them. They are occasionally used as bodyguards to various characters, specifically anyone claiming to be the king. Some episodes suggest that the penguins are afraid of the gorillas due to their power, but these are outnumbered by episodes in which the penguins easily beat them, typically without provocation. They also tend to play up the stereotype of Italian-American mobsters.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Fred|Fred]] (voiced by [[Fred Stoller]])&nbsp;\u2013 Fred is a [[squirrel]] that takes everything said literally and has a slow monotone speech pattern. Fred lives in a park near the zoo. He dated Marlene in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep42|Otter Things Have Happened]]\", but she broke up with him. He does not get excited about much, and consistently seems unhappy.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Burt|Burt]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])&nbsp;\u2013 Burt is an [[Indian elephant]] who was just one of the extra animals during the beginning of the series, but then he evolved into a character later on and even got a central episode in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep41|An Elephant Never Forgets]]\". He is shown to be obsessed with peanuts.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Manfredi and Johnson|Manfredi and Johnson]]&nbsp;(voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]] and [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) \u2013 Manfredi and Johnson are two unseen recruits, referenced mainly by Skipper, who have suffered horrible, seemingly fatal (\"You know, one up there and one down there!\" \u2013 Skipper) events in a number of previous penguin missions. Their \"fates\" have included having been attacked by \"flying piranhas\", their remains later ladled into their graves with a teaspoon; having been short one escape tunnel, their remains later sent back in a manila envelope, coincidentally from [[Manila]]; having mistaken the \"business end\" of a beluga for an escape tunnel, resulting in them not being able to speak for months; having fallen for the \"exploding elephant foot trick\"; a Chinese lantern and six bottles of rocket fuel for a talent show; having lost their hearts, a lung, and 15 feet of intestine when they fell in love with two [[Chinstrap penguin|chinstrap]] sisters; and being apparently literally smothered when a message informing the others to smother them with affection was misinterpreted. The two make a brief appearance&nbsp;\u2013 alive&nbsp;\u2013 in the episode \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\". \"Manfredi\" and \"Johnson\" are also the names of the two American POWs killed while trying to escape the German prison camp in the 1953 movie ''[[Stalag 17]]''.\n* Eggy (voiced by [[Tara Strong]])&nbsp;\u2013 Eggy is a [[duck]]ling who the penguins once \"egg-sitted\" in \"Paternal Egg-Stinct\". In the episode \"Hard Boiled Eggy\", the penguins learn that because they influenced him while inside the egg, Eggy had all their commando strengths combined. At the end of the episode, Julien teaches Eggy how to dance and Eggy finds such better than trying to be a penguin.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Alice|Alice]] (voiced by [[Mary Scheer]])&nbsp;\u2013 Alice is a surly [[zookeeper]], who regularly expresses disinterest in her job. Though another worker can sometimes be heard on her [[walkie-talkie]], and seen working around the zoo, his face is never seen.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#The Vesuvius Twins|The Vesuvius Twins]] (voiced by [[Atticus Shaffer]])&nbsp;\u2013 The Vesuvius Twins are two schoolboys from a very wealthy family. They are disliked by all of the animals of the zoo because of how nasty they are. Even though they are repeatedly banned from going near the animals, they usually get around the ban because of their parent's wealth, e.g. purchasing all of the tickets for an event at the zoo. Private often encourages others to show kindness to the boys, choosing to believe that they are secretly good.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Dr. Blowhole|Dr. Blowhole]] (voiced by [[Neil Patrick Harris]])&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Blowhole is Skipper's [[archenemy]]. He is an evil [[bottlenose dolphin]] scientist and supervillain, who has red [[lobster]]s as minions. He was mentioned in the episodes \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep20|Eclipsed]]\" and \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep22|Roomies]]\", but he makes a full appearance in the special \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep48|Dr. Blowhole's Revenge]]\". Doctor Blowhole makes another full appearance in \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\", where he uses his \"Mind Jacker\" and \"Diaboligizer\" to take over Central Park Zoo, but transforms Julian's Mp3 player into a giant \"music monster\". In \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\" (a sequel episode to \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\"), having had his memory erased by his own Mind Jacker, Blowhole remembers himself as Flippy, \"Seaville's second most popular performer\". He recalls nothing of the penguins or his evil self. In this episode, his real name is revealed to be Francis, and he has a sister named Doris. Blowhole rides on a [[Segway PT|Segway]]-type vehicle as his means of transportation on land. Four running gags are that his skin is \"surprisingly pleasant to the touch\", that he constantly mispronounces \"penguins\" as \"peng-u-ins\", that he calls the penguins \"flightless\", and that he constantly rubs in the fact that he has far more superior technology than the penguins do.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Hans|Hans]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])&nbsp;\u2013 Hans is a devious [[puffin]] with a past history with Skipper that involves a mission in Denmark that somehow resulted in Skipper being declared Public Enemy Number One in the country in question. During \"Huffin & Puffin\", he appeared in New York, initially apparently wanting to make peace with Skipper, before his true agenda was revealed to be his attempt to take control of the penguins' lair for revenge. With Skipper having infiltrated the lair and defeated Hans, he was then shipped to the Hoboken Zoo. He appeared in \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\", working with Doctor Blowhole as part of a plan to take Skipper's memories.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Rat King|The Rat King]] (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]])&nbsp;\u2013 The Rat King is a genetically enhanced, muscular lab [[rat]] who resides in the sewers. He constantly torments the penguins and never learns his lesson when he is defeated each time, although his raw strength often requires them to resort to less direct measures to defeat him. He even tries to take over their home, but is beaten by King Julien in an [[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep18|ice hockey game]].\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Officer X|Officer X]] (voiced by [[Cedric Yarbrough]])&nbsp;\u2013 Officer X is an [[animal control officer]]. He is obsessed with catching stray animals. He has a stronger grudge against the penguins than Alice. His first appearance is when he is searching for Max and the second appearance is when he was tracking down the penguins when they escaped the zoo. He is a very strong man and can take down even the strongest of animals, like Joey the Kangaroo. Officer X is very cocky and seems to have hunted many other animals before. In his second appearance he was arrested for going on a rampage after losing the penguins. He was an exterminator hired to remove cockroaches that Rico had befriended in \"Stop Bugging Me\" and a temporary zookeeper when Alice went on vacation in \"The Officer X Factor\". In the episode \"A Kipper for Skipper\" he is shown to be a fishmonger and manages to capture Kowalski, Private and Rico. But as in the other times they manage to escape, even though he was close to catch Kowalski in his obsession. And again he gets in trouble with the law.\n*[[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Savio|Savio]] (voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]])&nbsp;\u2013 is an enormous, sly and powerful boa constrictor, and one of the penguins most dangerous enemies. He enjoys eating small mammals. Savio appears in the episodes \"The Big Squeeze\" and \"All Tied Up With A Boa\". He also appears in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" and \"The Terror of Madagascar\".\n\n==Production==\nIn mid-2006, [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] and [[DreamWorks Animation]] announced that they would collaborate to create a show based on the ''[[Madagascar (film series)|Madagascar]]'' films. The new series would star the penguins from the film series. Nothing was confirmed on what the series would be about until November 2007.\n\nAt first, in November 2007, Nickelodeon advertised a sneak peek of three new Nicktoons coming to Nickelodeon, ''[[The Mighty B!]]'', ''[[Making Fiends (TV series)|Making Fiends]]'', and ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' all on November 25, 2007, as part of ''Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend''. Then, in December 2007, Nickelodeon advertised many events that were going to premiere in 2008 (''[[The Mighty B!]]'', ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]'', ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', [[2008 Kids' Choice Awards|KCA 2008]], ''[[The Naked Brothers Band: Sidekicks|Sidekicks (The Naked Brothers Band)]]'', and \"[[Pest of the West]]\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEa0vedhbtOWdc |title=The Penguins of Madagascar |accessdate=October 7, 2008 |publisher=movieweb.com}}</ref> Since then, ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' premiere was delayed at least twice in 2008. It was most likely delayed to make room for the release of ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'' on November 7, 2008. On November 28, 2008, Nickelodeon aired an episode from the series as a sneak peek. The series officially debuted 4 months later on March 28, 2009 at 9:30&nbsp;pm ET/PT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/shows/penguins-of-madagascar/index.jhtml|title=The Penguins of Madagascar|work=Official website|publisher=[[Nickelodeon (TV Channel)|Nickelodeon]]|accessdate=April 12, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416225212/http://www.nick.com/shows/penguins-of-madagascar/index.jhtml|archivedate=April 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Double DVD Pack edition of ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'' released on February 6, 2009 included an unaired episode of the show called \"Popcorn Panic\".

Based on its success, Hooga Loo was granted a license to create an entirely new toy line for the new series. Hooga Loo recruited the creative development team, [[Pangea Corporation]], the company who assisted Playmates Toys in the development of the very successful ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', to work systemically with DreamWorks and develop toys inspired by the series.<ref>Toys and Family Entertainment Magazine</ref> The toy line included a full range of plush characters, as well as collectible figures and wacky vehicles. Fast food restaurants courted DreamWorks to glean the rights for a [[quick service restaurant|QSR]] deal, which finally materialized in late 2009. McDonald's had produced a line of toys based on the second film. This relationship forged a new deal with McDonald's.\n\nLicensed merchandise based on the show began debuting in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toysrus.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&kw=penguins%20of%20madagascar&origkw=penguins%20of%20madagascar&f=Taxonomy/TRUS/2254197&sr=1 |title=Toys\"R\"Us/Babies\"R\"Us |publisher=Toysrus.com |accessdate=June 10, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref><ref name=\"news.toonzone.net\">{{cite web |url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/32066/penguins-of-madagascar-operation-dvd-premiere-arriving-feb-9-2010 |title=Animation News Discussion Cartoon Community \u2013 toonzone news |publisher=News.toonzone.net |accessdate=June 10, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> In February 2010, McDonald's began their \"Mission: Play\" Happy Meal toy campaign, which featured eight toys based on the penguins in the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.happymeal.com/en_US/standalone.html?s=Intro&swfH=450&swfW=772&bs=toys&swf=/en_US/swf3/sections/toys/intro/intro.swf&bgc=%23000000&ID=#Intro |title=HappyMeal.com |publisher=HappyMeal.com |date=February 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608103140/http://www.happymeal.com/en_US/standalone.html?s=Intro&swfH=450&swfW=772&bs=toys&swf=%2Fen_US%2Fswf3%2Fsections%2Ftoys%2Fintro%2Fintro.swf&bgc=%23000000&ID=#Intro |archivedate=June 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Video games==\n* ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar (video game)|The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' video game is a Nintendo DS action-adventure game based on the TV show of the same name.

It stars nine characters from the [[DreamWorks Animation]] animated film ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'': The penguins Skipper ([[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]), Rico ([[John DiMaggio]]), Kowalski ([[Jeff Bennett]]), and Private ([[James Patrick Stuart]]); the lemurs King Julien ([[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]), Maurice ([[Kevin Michael Richardson]]), and Mort ([[Andy Richter]]); and Mason ([[Conrad Vernon]]) and Phil the chimpanzees. Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter ([[Nicole Sullivan]]) and a zookeeper named Alice ([[Mary Scheer]]). It is the first Nicktoon produced with [[DreamWorks Animation]]. The series was executive produced by [[Bob Schooley]] and [[Mark McCorkle]], who were the creators of [[Pixar]]'s 2D-animated series ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' and [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[Kim Possible]]''.\n\nThe pilot episode, \"Gone in a Flash\", aired as part of \"Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend\" on Friday, November 28,<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/features/nick-serves-toons-for-thanksgiving/</ref> 2008, and ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' became a regular series on March 28, 2009.

The series follows the adventures of four penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private, who perform various commando-like missions to protect their home in the [[Central Park Zoo]]. The penguins often have to deal with problems caused, or made worse, by their zoo neighbors, King Julien XIII (a [[ring-tailed lemur]]), Maurice (an [[aye-aye]]), and Mort (a [[mouse lemur]]).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes}}\n{{:List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes}}\n<!-- To edit the content in this section you need to edit [[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes]] -->\n\n==Characters==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n''The Penguins of Madagascar'' features the four penguin characters from the ''Madagascar'' franchise, as well as the two chimpanzees and the three lemurs. Characters new to the franchise include Marlene the otter and Alice the zookeeper, among others. In addition, [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]], [[John DiMaggio]], [[Andy Richter]], and [[Conrad Vernon]] reprise their roles as Skipper, Rico, Mort, and Mason respectively.\n\nAll four of the penguin characters are designed differently in the cartoon than they are in the movie to make them more distinguishable and easier to tell apart. Skipper's head is flatter in the series; Kowalski is taller; Rico has an unexplained scar over his mouth, a double chin, and a feathery Mohawk; and Private is shorter, younger, and rounder. Their personalities and abilities were also exaggerated. The texture of the characters was also changed to be better suited for television work.<ref name=awm/>\n\n===Main===\n<!--Please do not add any characters that aren't designated as main characters. Single episode characters aren't needed here. Main characters are ordered per the closing credits of S1E1 (McGrath, DiMaggio, Bennett, Stuart. This ordering should not be changed without a new consensus.-->\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Skipper|Skipper]] (voiced by [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]])&nbsp;\u2013 Skipper is the leader of the penguins. He devises tactics and gives orders. Calculating, strict, energetic, paranoid, short-tempered and nearly unflappable, Skipper's raving paranoia and tendency to view even the most ordinary activities as a military operation, combined with his experience in covert ops, has driven him to prepare for nearly any situation, no matter how bizarre or unlikely. It is revealed in the episode \"Needle Point\" that Skipper is afraid of needles. McGrath reprises his role from the films.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Kowalski|Kowalski]] (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&nbsp;\u2013 Kowalski acts as the group strategist and gadgeteer. Kowalski is a brilliant inventor, but he cannot read (although he does carry around a clipboard upon which he records drawings of their plans). He also tends to over-analyze situations and has created many amazing devices which have put the team in danger. It is revealed in the episode \"Needle Point\" that he is afraid of going to the dentist.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Rico|Rico]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])&nbsp;\u2013 Rico is the team's weapons and explosives specialist, who mainly communicates through grunts and squeals, but sometimes he can speak rather normally. Slightly unhinged, Rico swallows useful tools, such as dynamite, and regurgitates them when needed, to the point of regularly regurgitating objects that appear to be too large for him to have swallowed in the first place. He has been referred to as a psychopath in several episodes. He is shown in some episodes to be in a relationship with a female doll called Miss Perky. DiMaggio reprises his role from the films. \n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Private|Private]] (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]])&nbsp;\u2013 Private is the emotionally sensitive, British-accented rookie of the group. Though younger and less experienced than the other penguins, he is the most down to earth; Private tends to offer simpler, more commonsense solutions in response to Skipper and Kowalski's complex strategies, often in an understated tone while those strategies are falling apart (''e.g.'', \"The Officer X Factor\"). He often shows an eager interest in unicorns, as evidenced by his love of a show called \"The Lunacorns\" (''e.g.'', \"Hello, Dollface\", \"Operation: Lunacorn Apocalypse\"), for which he is often ridiculed. Private is also a skilled fighter.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#King Julien|King Julien XIII]] (voiced by [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]])&nbsp;\u2013 Normally shortened to King Julien, King Julien XIII is a fun loving, witty, narcissistic [[ring-tailed lemur]]. The King of the Lemurs is a comically conceited character who has little regard for others, even his subjects. He has a tendency to use [[malapropism]]s and misinterpret [[figures of speech]]. King Julien considers himself to be king over all animals he encounters, but is oblivious to their dislike of him. He is very lazy, childish, immature, dim-witted, and spoiled to the point where he will not offer assistance to ensure his own safety. He is also very proud of his bottom, which he refers to as \"The Royal Booty\".\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Maurice|Maurice]] (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]])&nbsp;\u2013 Maurice is an [[aye-aye]] who is one of King Julien's subjects. Maurice accepts his life as a servant, but he often shows disdain towards King Julien and his inconsiderate attitude. He seems to be aware of human activities and inventions, even though he has spent most of his life away from human civilization.\n*[[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mort|Mort]] (voiced by [[Andy Richter]])&nbsp;\u2013 Mort is an excitable, dimwitted, accident-prone [[mouse lemur]]. Unlike Maurice, Mort is fiercely devoted to Julien, even displaying an obsession with the lemur king's feet. King Julien treats him with contempt. He is considered to be the cutest animal in the zoo, which upsets Private. Mort is occasionally enlisted to help the penguins due to his small size or cuteness. Richter reprises his role from the films.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Marlene|Marlene]] (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]; [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in wild form)&nbsp;\u2013 Marlene is a female [[otter]]<!--Any change from \"otter\" to a specific type of otter requires a citation --> who was transferred to the Central Park Zoo from the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]].<ref name=awm/> She is close friends with Skipper and sometimes tags along on his missions, but she is often a neutral character who does not take sides between the penguins and the lemurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/shows/penguins-of-madagascar/characters/marlene.html |title=Marlene from Penguins of Madagascar |publisher=[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> By being a levelheaded, feminine voice of reason, she is a counterpoint to Skipper's masculine, covert-ops character. Since she was born in captivity, once she sets out of the confines of the zoo, she goes wild as she cannot cope with the lack of boundaries. Later after Kowalski separated her wild side, she becomes afraid as her feral side roams over the city. The penguins later put the two Marlenes back together and Marlene is able to control her wild side. In \"Popcorn Panic\", a brief shot of the zoo map reveals her enclosure to be that of an \"Asian Otter\".\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Mason]] (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) and [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Mason and Phil|Phil]]&nbsp;\u2013 Mason and Phil are two intelligent [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s. Mason can speak and is very civilized and refined. Phil is [[Muteness|mute]], but is the only animal in the zoo that can read. Phil is often asked to read something, and then he communicates the message to Mason through [[sign language]]<ref name=awm/> which is interpreted by Mason. Different episodes indicate that they are highly intelligent, but they are not openly aware of this themselves. Phil is considered for involvement with a space exploration program. Vernon reprises his role from the films.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Roger|Roger]] (voiced by [[Richard Kind]])&nbsp;\u2013 Roger is the penguins' [[alligator]] friend [[Sewer alligator|who lives in the sewer]]. They meet him in the episode \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep3|Haunted Habitat]]\" when Skipper and Marlene go to investigate in the sewer under Marlene's habitat because of a strange sound. Roger tells the penguins that he is from Florida. He appears again in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep25|Roger Dodger]]\" when the sewer rats terrorize him and in \"Gator Watch\" when he wants a new home, eventually being captured and sent to the zoo.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Max|Max / \"Moon-cat\"]] (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]])&nbsp;\u2013 Max is the penguins' stray [[cat]] friend. He first meets the four penguins in the episode \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep2|Launchtime]]\" when the penguins end up on a rooftop across the street from the zoo instead of on the moon. At first, the penguins thought he was a \"moon-cat\" but at the end they figure out he was a stray cat, but they still refer to Max as \"Moon-cat\" out of habit. Max is skinny and hopes to catch a bird in his life. He at first wanted to eat the penguins, but was so touched when they gave him a can of fish that he became their friend instead. He appeared again in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep28|Cat's Cradle]]\", in which he tried to hide from Officer X from Animal Control.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Joey|Joey]] (voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]] in an Australian accent) is an anti-social [[kangaroo]] with a passion for boxing. He is extremely possessive of his habitat. Most of his comments refer to physically hurting the subject of discussion.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Bada and Bing|Bada and Bing]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]])&nbsp;\u2013 Bada and Bing are two [[gorilla]]s who enjoy fighting. They once beat up Mort, which led to Mort growing after he was thrown into Kowalski's latest invention, and they then got beat up by Mort to get a mango. Julien once gave them lots of bananas but it is possible that they beat him up due to him giving too much to them. They are occasionally used as bodyguards to various characters, specifically anyone claiming to be the king. Some episodes suggest that the penguins are afraid of the gorillas due to their power, but these are outnumbered by episodes in which the penguins easily beat them, typically without provocation. They also tend to play up the stereotype of Italian-American mobsters.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Fred|Fred]] (voiced by [[Fred Stoller]])&nbsp;\u2013 Fred is a [[squirrel]] that takes everything said literally and has a slow monotone speech pattern. Fred lives in a park near the zoo. He dated Marlene in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep42|Otter Things Have Happened]]\", but she broke up with him. He does not get excited about much, and consistently seems unhappy.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Burt|Burt]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])&nbsp;\u2013 Burt is an [[Indian elephant]] who was just one of the extra animals during the beginning of the series, but then he evolved into a character later on and even got a central episode in \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep41|An Elephant Never Forgets]]\". He is shown to be obsessed with peanuts.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Manfredi and Johnson|Manfredi and Johnson]]&nbsp;(voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]] and [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]) \u2013 Manfredi and Johnson are two unseen recruits, referenced mainly by Skipper, who have suffered horrible, seemingly fatal (\"You know, one up there and one down there!\" \u2013 Skipper) events in a number of previous penguin missions. Their \"fates\" have included having been attacked by \"flying piranhas\", their remains later ladled into their graves with a teaspoon; having been short one escape tunnel, their remains later sent back in a manila envelope, coincidentally from [[Manila]]; having mistaken the \"business end\" of a beluga for an escape tunnel, resulting in them not being able to speak for months; having fallen for the \"exploding elephant foot trick\"; a Chinese lantern and six bottles of rocket fuel for a talent show; having lost their hearts, a lung, and 15 feet of intestine when they fell in love with two [[Chinstrap penguin|chinstrap]] sisters; and being apparently literally smothered when a message informing the others to smother them with affection was misinterpreted. The two make a brief appearance&nbsp;\u2013 alive&nbsp;\u2013 in the episode \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\". \"Manfredi\" and \"Johnson\" are also the names of the two American POWs killed while trying to escape the German prison camp in the 1953 movie ''[[Stalag 17]]''.\n* Eggy (voiced by [[Tara Strong]])&nbsp;\u2013 Eggy is a [[duck]]ling who the penguins once \"egg-sitted\" in \"Paternal Egg-Stinct\". In the episode \"Hard Boiled Eggy\", the penguins learn that because they influenced him while inside the egg, Eggy had all their commando strengths combined. At the end of the episode, Julien teaches Eggy how to dance and Eggy finds such better than trying to be a penguin.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Alice|Alice]] (voiced by [[Mary Scheer]])&nbsp;\u2013 Alice is a surly [[zookeeper]], who regularly expresses disinterest in her job. Though another worker can sometimes be heard on her [[walkie-talkie]], and seen working around the zoo, his face is never seen.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#The Vesuvius Twins|The Vesuvius Twins]] (voiced by [[Atticus Shaffer]])&nbsp;\u2013 The Vesuvius Twins are two schoolboys from a very wealthy family. They are disliked by all of the animals of the zoo because of how nasty they are. Even though they are repeatedly banned from going near the animals, they usually get around the ban because of their parent's wealth, e.g. purchasing all of the tickets for an event at the zoo. Private often encourages others to show kindness to the boys, choosing to believe that they are secretly good.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Dr. Blowhole|Dr. Blowhole]] (voiced by [[Neil Patrick Harris]])&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Blowhole is Skipper's [[archenemy]]. He is an evil [[bottlenose dolphin]] scientist and supervillain, who has red [[lobster]]s as minions. He was mentioned in the episodes \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep20|Eclipsed]]\" and \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep22|Roomies]]\", but he makes a full appearance in the special \"[[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep48|Dr. Blowhole's Revenge]]\". Doctor Blowhole makes another full appearance in \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\", where he uses his \"Mind Jacker\" and \"Diaboligizer\" to take over Central Park Zoo, but transforms Julian's Mp3 player into a giant \"music monster\". In \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\" (a sequel episode to \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\"), having had his memory erased by his own Mind Jacker, Blowhole remembers himself as Flippy, \"Seaville's second most popular performer\". He recalls nothing of the penguins or his evil self. In this episode, his real name is revealed to be Francis, and he has a sister named Doris. Blowhole rides on a [[Segway PT|Segway]]-type vehicle as his means of transportation on land. Four running gags are that his skin is \"surprisingly pleasant to the touch\", that he constantly mispronounces \"penguins\" as \"peng-u-ins\", that he calls the penguins \"flightless\", and that he constantly rubs in the fact that he has far more superior technology than the penguins do.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Hans|Hans]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]])&nbsp;\u2013 Hans is a devious [[puffin]] with a past history with Skipper that involves a mission in Denmark that somehow resulted in Skipper being declared Public Enemy Number One in the country in question. During \"Huffin & Puffin\", he appeared in New York, initially apparently wanting to make peace with Skipper, before his true agenda was revealed to be his attempt to take control of the penguins' lair for revenge. With Skipper having infiltrated the lair and defeated Hans, he was then shipped to the Hoboken Zoo. He appeared in \"The Return of the Revenge of Doctor Blowhole\", working with Doctor Blowhole as part of a plan to take Skipper's memories.\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Rat King|The Rat King]] (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]])&nbsp;\u2013 The Rat King is a genetically enhanced, muscular lab [[rat]] who resides in the sewers. He constantly torments the penguins and never learns his lesson when he is defeated each time, although his raw strength often requires them to resort to less direct measures to defeat him. He even tries to take over their home, but is beaten by King Julien in an [[List of The Penguins of Madagascar episodes#ep18|ice hockey game]].\n* [[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Officer X|Officer X]] (voiced by [[Cedric Yarbrough]])&nbsp;\u2013 Officer X is an [[animal control officer]]. He is obsessed with catching stray animals. He has a stronger grudge against the penguins than Alice. His first appearance is when he is searching for Max and the second appearance is when he was tracking down the penguins when they escaped the zoo. He is a very strong man and can take down even the strongest of animals, like Joey the Kangaroo. Officer X is very cocky and seems to have hunted many other animals before. In his second appearance he was arrested for going on a rampage after losing the penguins. He was an exterminator hired to remove cockroaches that Rico had befriended in \"Stop Bugging Me\" and a temporary zookeeper when Alice went on vacation in \"The Officer X Factor\". In the episode \"A Kipper for Skipper\" he is shown to be a fishmonger and manages to capture Kowalski, Private and Rico. But as in the other times they manage to escape, even though he was close to catch Kowalski in his obsession. And again he gets in trouble with the law.\n*[[List of Madagascar (franchise) characters#Savio|Savio]] (voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]])&nbsp;\u2013 is an enormous, sly and powerful boa constrictor, and one of the penguins most dangerous enemies. He enjoys eating small mammals. Savio appears in the episodes \"The Big Squeeze\" and \"All Tied Up With A Boa\". He also appears in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" and \"The Terror of Madagascar\".\n\n==Production==\nIn mid-2006, [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] and [[DreamWorks Animation]] announced that they would collaborate to create a show based on the ''[[Madagascar (film series)|Madagascar]]'' films. The new series would star the penguins from the film series. Nothing was confirmed on what the series would be about until November 2007.\n\nAt first, in November 2007, Nickelodeon advertised a sneak peek of three new Nicktoons coming to Nickelodeon, ''[[The Mighty B!]]'', ''[[Making Fiends (TV series)|Making Fiends]]'', and ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' all on November 25, 2007, as part of ''Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend''. Then, in December 2007, Nickelodeon advertised many events that were going to premiere in 2008 (''[[The Mighty B!]]'', ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]'', ''The Penguins of Madagascar'', [[2008 Kids' Choice Awards|KCA 2008]], ''[[The Naked Brothers Band: Sidekicks|Sidekicks (The Naked Brothers Band)]]'', and \"[[Pest of the West]]\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEa0vedhbtOWdc |title=The Penguins of Madagascar |accessdate=October 7, 2008 |publisher=movieweb.com}}</ref> Since then, ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' premiere was delayed at least twice in 2008. It was most likely delayed to make room for the release of ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'' on November 7, 2008. On November 28, 2008, Nickelodeon aired an episode from the series as a sneak peek. The series officially debuted 4 months later on March 28, 2009 at 9:30&nbsp;pm ET/PT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/shows/penguins-of-madagascar/index.jhtml|title=The Penguins of Madagascar|work=Official website|publisher=[[Nickelodeon (TV Channel)|Nickelodeon]]|accessdate=April 12, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416225212/http://www.nick.com/shows/penguins-of-madagascar/index.jhtml|archivedate=April 16, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Double DVD Pack edition of ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'' released on February 6, 2009 included an unaired episode of the show called \"Popcorn Panic\".

Based on its success, Hooga Loo was granted a license to create an entirely new toy line for the new series. Hooga Loo recruited the creative development team, [[Pangea Corporation]], the company who assisted Playmates Toys in the development of the very successful ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', to work systemically with DreamWorks and develop toys inspired by the series.<ref>Toys and Family Entertainment Magazine</ref> The toy line included a full range of plush characters, as well as collectible figures and wacky vehicles.

Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as \"the Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=186}} Works in this vein include the ballets ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'', ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' and ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]'', his ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' and [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]]. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.\n\nAfter some initial studies with composer [[Rubin Goldmark]], Copland traveled to Paris, where he first studied with [[Isidor Philipp]] and [[Paul Vidal]], then with noted [[pedagogue]] [[Nadia Boulanger]]. He studied three years with Boulanger, whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste. Determined upon his return to the U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer, Copland gave lecture-recitals, wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing. However, he found that composing orchestral music in the [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] style, which he had adopted while studying abroad, was a financially-contradictory approach, particularly in light of the [[Great Depression]]. He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of {{lang|de|[[Gebrauchsmusik]]}} (\"music for use\"), music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes. During the Depression years, he traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico, formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]] and began composing his signature works.\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Copland became aware that [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and other fellow composers had begun to study [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s use of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone (serial) techniques]]. After he had been exposed to the works of French composer [[Pierre Boulez]], he incorporated serial techniques into his ''Piano Quartet'' (1950), ''Piano Fantasy'' (1957), ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' for orchestra (1961) and ''[[Inscape (Copland)|Inscape]]'' for orchestra (1967). Unlike Schoenberg, Copland used his tone rows in much the same fashion as his tonal material\u2014as sources for melodies and harmonies, rather than as complete statements in their own right, except for crucial events from a structural point of view. From the 1960s onward, Copland's activities turned more from composing to conducting. He became a frequent guest conductor of orchestras in the U.S. and the UK and made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for [[Columbia Records]].\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Aaron Copland School of Music (541691170).jpg|thumb|Aaron Copland School of Music, Queens College (part of the [[City University of New York]])]]\nAaron Copland was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on November 14, 1900.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=15}} He was the youngest of five children in a [[Conservative Jewish]] family of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] origins.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=19}} While emigrating from Russia to the United States, Copland's father, Harris Morris Copland, lived and worked in Scotland for two to three years to pay for his boat fare to the US. It was there that Copland's father may have [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] his surname \"Kaplan\" to \"Copland\", though Copland himself believed for many years that the change had been due to an [[Ellis Island]] immigration official when his father entered the country.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=15}}<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |jstor=832353 |title=Conversation with Aaron Copland |first1=Edward T. |last1=Cone |first2=Aaron |last2=Copland |date=January 1, 1968 |journal=Perspectives of New Music |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=57\u201372 |doi=10.2307/832353}}</ref> Copland was however unaware until late in his life that the family name had been Kaplan, and his parents never told him this.<ref name=\"jstor.org\" /> Throughout his childhood, Copland and his family lived above his parents' [[Brooklyn]] shop, H.M. Copland's, at 628 Washington Avenue (which Aaron would later describe as \"a kind of neighborhood [[Macy's]]\"),{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=16}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Paton |first=David W. |title=1905 State of New York Census.

His father was a staunch Democrat. The family members were active in [[Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes]], where Aaron celebrated his [[Bar Mitzvah]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=26}} Not especially athletic, the sensitive young man became an avid reader and often read [[Horatio Alger]] stories on his front steps.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=15}}\n\nCopland's father had no musical interest. His mother, Sarah Mittenthal Copland, sang, played the piano, and arranged for music lessons for her children.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=19}} Of his siblings, oldest brother Ralph was the most advanced musically, proficient on the violin. His sister Laurine had the strongest connection with Aaron; she gave him his first piano lessons, promoted his musical education, and supported him in his musical career.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=19}} A student at the Metropolitan Opera School and a frequent opera-goer, Laurine also brought home [[libretti]] for Aaron to study.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=17}} Copland attended [[Boys High School (Brooklyn)|Boys High School]] and in the summer went to various camps. Most of his early exposure to music was at Jewish weddings and ceremonies, and occasional family musicales.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=26}}\n\nCopland began writing songs at the age of eight and a half.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}} His earliest notated music, about seven bars he wrote when age 11, was for an opera scenario he created and called ''Zenatello''.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=32}} From 1913 to 1917 he took piano lessons with Leopold Wolfsohn, who taught him the standard classical fare.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}} Copland's first public music performance was at a [[Wanamaker's]] recital.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=18}}{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=23}} By the age of 15, after attending a concert by composer-pianist [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], Copland decided to become a composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=33}} After attempts to further his music study from a [[correspondence course]], Copland took formal lessons in [[harmony]], [[music theory|theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] from [[Rubin Goldmark]], a noted teacher and composer of American music (who had given [[George Gershwin]] three lessons). Goldmark, with whom Copland studied between 1917 and 1921, gave the young Copland a solid foundation, especially in the Germanic tradition.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=34}} As Copland stated later: \"This was a stroke of luck for me. I was spared the floundering that so many musicians have suffered through incompetent teaching.\"{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=23}} But Copland also commented that the maestro had \"little sympathy for the advanced musical idioms of the day\" and his \"approved\" composers ended with [[Richard Strauss]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=35}}\n\nCopland's graduation piece from his studies with Goldmark was a three-movement piano [[sonata]] in a [[Romantic music|Romantic style]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=36}} But he had also composed more original and daring pieces which he did not share with his teacher.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=37}} In addition to regularly attending the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[New York Symphony]], where he heard the standard classical repertory, Copland continued his musical development through an expanding circle of musical friends. After graduating from high school, Copland played in dance bands.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=39}} Continuing his musical education, he received further piano lessons from Victor Wittgenstein, who found his student to be \"quiet, shy, well-mannered, and gracious in accepting criticism\".{{sfn|Smith|1953|pp=25, 31}} Copland's fascination with the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and its promise for freeing the lower classes drew a rebuke from his father and uncles.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=30}} In spite of that, in his early adult life Copland would develop friendships with people with socialist and communist leanings.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=237}}\n\n=== Study in Paris ===\n[[File:Nadia Boulanger 1925.jpg|thumb|Nadia Boulanger in 1925]]\nCopland's passion for the latest European music, plus glowing letters from his friend Aaron Schaffer, inspired him to go to Paris for further study.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=33}} An article in ''[[Musical America]]'' about a summer school program for American musicians at the [[Fontainebleau School of Music]], offered by the French government, encouraged Copland still further.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=35}} His father wanted him to go to college, but his mother's vote in the family conference allowed him to give Paris a try. On arriving in [[France]], he studied at Fontainebleau with pianist and pedagogue [[Isidor Philipp]] and composer [[Paul Vidal]]. When Copland found Vidal too much like Goldmark, he switched at the suggestion of a fellow student to [[Nadia Boulanger]], then aged 34.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|pp=47\u201348, 50}} He had initial reservations: \"No one to my knowledge had ever before thought of studying with a woman.\"{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=41}} She interviewed him, and recalled later: \"One could tell his talent immediately.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=41}}\n\nBoulanger had as many as 40 students at once and employed a formal regimen that Copland had to follow. Copland found her incisive mind much to his liking and found her ability to critique a composition impeccable. Boulanger \"could always find the weak spot in a place you suspected was weak.... She could also tell you ''why'' it was weak [italics Copland].\"{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=63}} He wrote in a letter to his brother Ralph, \"This intellectual Amazon is not only professor at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]], is not only familiar with all music from Bach to Stravinsky, but is prepared for anything worse in the way of dissonance. But make no mistake&nbsp;... A more charming womanly woman never lived.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=47}} Copland later wrote that \"it was wonderful for me to find a teacher with such openness of mind, while at the same time she held firm ideas of right and wrong in musical matters. The confidence she had in my talents and her belief in me were at the very least flattering and more\u2014they were crucial to my development at this time of my career.\"{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=64}} Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste.\n\nAlong with his studies with Boulanger, Copland took classes in French language and history at the [[Sorbonne]], attended plays, and frequented [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], the English-language bookstore that was a gathering-place for expatriate American writers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=54\u201355}} Among this group in the heady cultural atmosphere of Paris in the 1920s were [[Paul Bowles]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Ezra Pound]], as well as artists like [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marc Chagall]], and [[Amedeo Modigliani]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=51}} Also influential on the new music were the French intellectuals [[Marcel Proust]], [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]; the latter cited by Copland as being his personal favorite and most read.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=53\u201354}} Travels to Italy, Austria, and Germany rounded out Copland's musical education. During his stay in Paris, Copland began writing musical critiques, the first on [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]], which helped spread his fame and stature in the music community.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=62}}\n\n=== 1925 to 1935 ===\n[[File:Kousewitzky.gif|thumb|left|[[Serge Koussevitzky]] was a mentor and supporter of Copland]]\nInstead of wallowing in self-pity and self-destruction like many of the expatriate members of the [[Lost Generation]], Copland returned to America optimistic and enthusiastic about the future, determined to make his way as a full-time composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=55}} He rented a studio apartment on New York City's [[Upper West Side]] in the [[The Empire Hotel (New York City)|Empire Hotel]], close to [[Carnegie Hall]] and other musical venues and publishers. He remained in that area for the next thirty years, later moving to [[Westchester County, New York]]. Copland lived frugally and survived financially with help from two $2,500 [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s in 1925 and 1926 ({{Inflation|US|2500|1925|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=89}} Lecture-recitals, awards, appointments, and small commissions, plus some teaching, writing, and personal loans kept him afloat in the subsequent years through World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=90}} Also important, especially during the Depression, were wealthy patrons who underwrote performances, helped pay for publication of works and promoted musical events and composers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=90}} Among those mentors was [[Serge Koussevitzky]], the music director of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and known as a champion of \"new music\". Koussevitsky would prove to be influential in Copland's life, perhaps the second most important after Boulanger.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=121\u201322}} Beginning with the [[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (Copland)|Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]] (1924), Koussevitzky would perform more of Copland's music than that of any the composer's contemporaries, even while other conductors programmed only a few of Copland's works{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=123}}\n\nSoon after his return, Copland was exposed to the artistic circle of photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]]. While Copland did not care for Stieglitz's domineering attitude, he admired his work and took to heart Stieglitz's conviction that American artists should reflect \"the ideas of American Democracy\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=101}} This ideal influenced not just the composer but also a generation of artists and photographers, including [[Paul Strand]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Walker Evans]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=101}} Evans' photographs inspired portions of Copland's opera ''[[The Tender Land]]''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=103}}\n\nIn his quest to take up the slogan of the Stieglitz group, \"Affirm America\", Copland found only the music of [[Carl Ruggles]] and [[Charles Ives]] upon which to draw.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=101, 110}} Without what Copland called a \"usable past\", he looked toward jazz and popular music, something he had already started to do while in Europe.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=113}}  In the 1920s, [[George Gershwin]], [[Bessie Smith]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] were in the forefront American popular music and jazz.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=115\u201316}} By the end of the decade, Copland felt his music was going in a more abstract, less jazz-oriented direction.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|pp=134\u201335}} However, as large swing bands such as those of [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Glenn Miller]] became popular in the 1930s, Copland took a renewed interest in the genre.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Alfred Stieglitz 1935 Apr 17.jpg|thumb|Copland admired the work and philosophy of [[Alfred Stieglitz]] ]]\nInspired by the example of [[Les Six]] in France, Copland sought out contemporaries such as [[Roger Sessions]], [[Roy Harris]], [[Virgil Thomson]], and [[Walter Piston]], and quickly established himself as a spokesman for composers of his generation.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=159}} He also helped found the Copland-Sessions Concerts to showcase these composers' chamber works to new audiences.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=166\u201367}} Copland's relationship with these men, who became known as \"commando unit\" was one of both support and rivalry, and he played a key role in keeping them together until after World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=176}} He was also generous with his time with nearly every American young composer he met during his life, later earning the title, \"Dean of American Music\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 215}}\n\nWith the knowledge he had gained from his studies in Paris, Copland came into demand as a lecturer and writer on contemporary European [[classical music]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} From 1927 to 1930 and 1935 to 1938, he taught classes at [[The New School|The New School of Social Research]] in New York City.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} Eventually, his New School lectures would appear in the form of two books\u2014''What to Listen for in Music'' (1937, revised 1957) and ''Our New Music'' (1940, revised 1968 and retitled ''The New Music: 1900\u20131960'').{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} During this period, Copland also wrote regularly for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' and a number of other journals. These articles would appear in 1969 as the book ''Copland on Music''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}}\n\nCopland's compositions in the early 1920s reflected the modernist attitude that prevailed among intellectuals, that the arts need be accessible to only a cadre of the enlightened and that the masses would come to appreciate their efforts over time. However, mounting troubles with the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and ''Short Symphony'' (1933) caused him to rethink this approach. It was financially contradictory, particularly in the Depression. Avant-garde music had lost what cultural historian [[Morris Dickstein]] calls \"its buoyant experimental edge\" and the national mood toward it had changed.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} As biographer [[Howard Pollack]] points out,{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=158}}\n<blockquote>\nCopland observed two trends among composers in the 1930s: first, a continuing attempt to \"simplify their musical language\" and, second, a desire to \"make contact\" with as wide an audience as possible. Since 1927, he had been in the process of simplifying, or at least paring down, his musical language, though in such a manner as to sometimes have the effect, paradoxically, of estranging audiences and performers. By 1933 ... he began to find ways to make his starkly personal language accessible to a surprisingly large number of people.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn many ways, this shift mirrored the German idea of {{lang|de|[[Gebrauchsmusik]]}} (\"music for use\"), as composers sought to create music that could serve a utilitarian as well as artistic purpose. This approach encompassed two trends: first, music that students could easily learn, and second, music which would have wider appeal, such as incidental music for plays, movies, radio, etc.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=162}} Toward this end, Copland provided musical advice and inspiration to [[Group Theatre (New York)|The Group Theatre]], a company which also attracted [[Stella Adler]], [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Lee Strasberg]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=258}} Philosophically an outgrowth of Stieglitz and his ideals, the Group focused on socially-relevant plays by the American authors.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=257}} Through it and later his work in film, Copland met several major American playwrights, including [[Thornton Wilder]], [[William Inge]], [[Arthur Miller]], and [[Edward Albee]], and considered projects with all of them.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=267}}\n\n=== 1935 to 1950 ===\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename     = Aron Copland Appalachian Spring Opening original version for 13 instruments.ogg\n| title        = Opening: ''Appalachian Spring'', original version for 13 instruments\n| description  = Sample of the opening movement in Copland's ballet}}\n\nAround 1935 Copland began to compose musical pieces for young audiences, in accordance with the first goal of American Gebrauchsmusik.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=303}} These works included piano pieces (''The Young Pioneers'') and an opera (''[[The Second Hurricane]]'').{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=303\u201305}} During the Depression years, Copland traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico. He formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]] and would return often to Mexico for working vacations conducting engagements.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 226}} During his initial visit to Mexico, Copland began composing the first of his signature works, ''[[El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]]'', which he completed in 1936. In it and in ''The Second Hurricane'' Copland began \"experimenting\", as he phrased it, with a simpler, more accessible style.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=245}} This and other incidental commissions fulfilled the second goal of American Gebrauchsmusik, creating music of wide appeal.\n\n[[File:Carlos Chavez.jpg|thumb|Carlos Ch\u00e1vez in 1937]]\nConcurrent with ''The Second Hurricane'', Copland composed (for radio broadcast) \"Prairie Journal\" on a commission from the [[Columbia Broadcast System]].{{Sfn|Pollack|1999|p=310}} This was one of his first pieces to convey the landscape of the American West.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=312}} This emphasis on the frontier carried over to his ballet ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1938), which along with ''El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico'' became his first widespread public success.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=187}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=323}} Copland's ballet music established him as an authentic composer of American music much as Stravinsky's ballet scores connected the composer with Russian music and came at an opportune time.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=184}} He helped fill a vacuum for American choreographers to fill their dance repertory{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=185}} and tapped into an artistic groundswell, from the motion pictures of [[Busby Berkeley]] and [[Fred Astaire]] to the ballets of [[George Balanchine]] and [[Martha Graham]], to both democratize and Americanize dance as an art form.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=94}} In 1939, Copland completed his first two Hollywood film scores, for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'', and composed the radio score \"John Henry\", based on [[John Henry (folklore)|the folk ballad]].{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=169}}\n\nWhile these works and others like them that would follow were accepted by the listening public at large, detractors accused Copland of pandering to the masses.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=308, 336}} Music critic [[Paul Rosenfeld]], for one, warned in 1939 that Copland was \"standing in the fork in the highroad, the two branches of which lead respectively to popular and artistic success.\"{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=338}}  Even some of the composer's friends, such as composer [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]], were confused about Copland's simpler style.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=336}} One, composer [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], went so far as to lecture Copland: \"By having sold out to the mongrel commercialists half-way already, the danger is going to be wider for you, and I beg you dear Aaron, don't sell out [entirely] yet.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=190}} Copland's response was that his writing as he did and in as many genres was his response to how the Depression had affected society, as well as to new media and the audiences made available by these new media.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=308\u201309}} As he himself phrased it, \"The composer who is frightened of losing his artistic integrity through contact with a mass audience is no longer aware of the meaning of the word art.\"{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=338}}\n\nThe 1940s were arguably Copland's most productive years, and some of his works from this period would cement his worldwide fame. His ballet scores for ''[[Rodeo (Copland)|Rodeo]]'' (1942) and ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'' (1944) were huge successes. His pieces ''[[Lincoln Portrait]]'' and ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' became patriotic standards. Also important was the [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]]. Composed in a two-year period from 1944 to 1946, it became Copland's best-known symphony.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=410, 418}} The [[Clarinet Concerto (Copland)|Clarinet Concerto]] (1948), scored for solo clarinet, strings, harp, and piano, was a commission piece for bandleader and clarinetist Benny Goodman and a complement to Copland's earlier jazz-influenced work, the [[Piano Concerto (Copland)|Piano Concerto]] (1926).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=424}} His ''Four Piano Blues'' is an introspective composition with a jazz influence.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=427}} Copland finished the 1940s with two film scores, one for [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Heiress]]'' and one for the [[The Red Pony (1949 film)|film adaptation]] of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Red Pony]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=202}}\n\nIn 1949, Copland returned to Europe, where he found French composer Pierre Boulez dominating the group of post-war avant-garde composers there.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=460}} He also met with proponents of twelve-tone technique, based on the works of Arnold Schoenberg, and found himself interested in adapting serial methods to his own musical voice.\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nIn 1950, Copland received a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission]] scholarship to study in Rome, which he did the following year. Around this time, he also composed his Piano Quartet, adopting Schoenberg's twelve-tone method of composition, and ''[[Old American Songs]]'' (1950), the first set of which was premiered by Peter Pears and [[Benjamin Britten]], the second by [[William Warfield]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=467}} During the 1951\u201352 academic year, Copland gave a series of lectures under the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Professorship]] at [[Harvard University]]. These lectures were published as the book ''Music and Imagination''.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=170}}\n\n[[File:Aaron Copland 1962.JPG|thumb|left|Aaron Copland in 1962 from a television special]]\nBecause of his [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] views, which had included his support of the [[Communist Party USA]] ticket during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]] and his strong support of [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]] during the 1948 presidential election, Copland was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] during the [[McCarthyism|Red scare]] of the 1950s.  He was included on an FBI list of 151 artists thought to have Communist associations and found himself [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], with ''A Lincoln Portrait'' withdrawn from the 1953 inaugural concert for President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=452}} Called later that year to a private hearing at the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Copland was questioned by [[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[Roy Cohn]] about his lecturing abroad and his affiliations with various organizations and events.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=455\u201377}} In the process, McCarthy and Cohn neglected completely Copland's works, which made a virtue of American values.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=452, 456}} Outraged by the accusations, many members of the musical community held up Copland's music as a banner of his patriotism. The investigations ceased in 1955 and were closed in 1975.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=458}}\n\nThe McCarthy probes did not seriously affect Copland's career and international artistic reputation, taxing of his time, energy, and emotional state as they might have been.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=458}} Nevertheless, beginning in 1950, Copland\u2014who had been appalled at Stalin's persecution of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] and other artists\u2014began resigning from participation in leftist groups.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=285}} Copland, Pollack states, \"stayed particularly concerned about the role of the artist in society\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=286}} He decried the lack of artistic freedom in the Soviet Union, and in his 1954 Norton lecture he asserted that loss of freedom under Soviet Communism deprived artists of \"the immemorial right of the artist to be wrong\". He began to vote Democratic, first for Stevenson and then for Kennedy.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=285}}\n\nPotentially more damaging for Copland was a sea-change in artistic tastes, away from the Populist mores that infused his work of the 1930s and 40s.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} Beginning in the 1940s, intellectuals assailed Popular Front culture, to which Copland's music was linked, and labeled it, in Dickstein's words, as \"hopelessly middlebrow, a [[dumbing down]] of art into toothless entertainment\".{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} They often linked their disdain for Populist art with technology, new media and mass audiences\u2014in other words, the areas of radio, television and motion pictures, for which Copland either had or soon would write music, as well as his popular ballets.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} While these attacks actually began at the end of the 1930s with the writings of [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Dwight Macdonald]] for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', they were based in anti-Stalinist politics and would accelerate in the decades following World War II.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}}\n\nDespite any difficulties that his suspected Communist sympathies might have posed, Copland traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 60s to observe the [[avant-garde]] styles of Europe, hear compositions by Soviet composers not well known in the West and experience the new school of Polish music.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=462\u201364}} While in Japan, he was taken with the work of [[Toru Takemitsu]] and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=464\u201365}} Copland revised his text \"The New Music\" with comments on the styles that he encountered.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=465\u201366}} He found much of what he heard dull and impersonal.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=466}} [[Electronic music]] seemed to have \"a depressing sameness of sound,\" while [[aleatoric music]] was for those \"who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=465}} As he summarized, \"I've spent most of my life trying to get the right note in the right place. Just throwing it open to chance seems to go against my natural instincts.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=465}}\n\nIn 1952, Copland received a commission from the [[League of Composers]], funded by a grant from [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], to write an opera for television.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} While Copland was aware of the potential pitfalls of that genre, which included weak libretti and demanding production values, he had also been thinking about writing an opera since the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} Among the subjects he had considered were [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s ''[[An American Tragedy]]'' and [[Frank Norris]]'s ''[[McTeague]]''{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} He finally settled on [[James Agee]]'s ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'', which seemed appropriate for the more intimate setting of television and could also be used in the \"college trade\", with more schools mounting operas than they had before World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} The resulting opera, ''[[The Tender Land]]'' was written in two acts but later expanded to three. As Copland feared, critics found the libretto to be weak when the opera premiered in 1954.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=478}} In spite of its flaws, the opera became one of the few American operas to enter the standard repertory.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=478}}\n\nIn 1957, 1958, and 1976, Copland was the Music Director of the [[Ojai Music Festival]], a classical and contemporary music festival in [[Ojai, California]].<ref>[http://www.ojaifestival.org/music-directors-2/ Music Directors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701064355/http://www.ojaifestival.org/music-directors-2/ |date=July 1, 2013 }}, Ojai Music Festival.</ref> For the occasion of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial]], Copland composed ''Ceremonial Fanfare For Brass Ensemble'' to accompany the exhibition \"Masterpieces Of Fifty Centuries\".

Nevertheless, he inherited a considerable interest in civic and world events from his father.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=270\u201371}} His views were generally progressive and he had strong ties with numerous colleagues and friends in the Popular Front, including Odets.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=60}} Early in his life, Copland  developed, in [[Howard Pollack|Pollack]]'s words, \"a deep admiration for the works of Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser and [[Upton Sinclair]], all socialists whose novels passionately excoriated capitalism's physical and emotional toll on the average man\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=272}} Even after the McCarthy hearings, he remained a committed opponent of militarism and the Cold War, which he regarded as having been instigated by the United States.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=280, 283\u201384}} He condemned it as \"almost worse for art than the real thing\". Throw the artist \"into a mood of suspicion, ill-will, and dread that typifies the cold war attitude and he'll create nothing\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=284\u201385}}\n\nWhile Copland had various encounters with organized religious thought, which influenced some of his early compositions, he remained [[agnostic]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=28, 328}} He was close with the Zionism during the Popular Front movement, when it was endorsed by the left. Pollack writes,{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=27\u201328}}\n<blockquote>\nLike many contemporaries, Copland regarded Judaism alternately in terms of religion, culture, and race; but he showed relatively little involvement in any aspect of his Jewish heritage.... At the same time, he had ties to Christianity, identifying with such profoundly Christian writers as [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and often spending Christmas Day at home with a special dinner with close friends.... In general, his music seemed to evoke Protestant hymns as often as it did Jewish chant....Copland characteristically found connections among various religious traditions.... But if Copland was discreet about his Jewish background, he never hid it, either.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Victor Kraft, 1935.jpg|thumb|Victor Kraft, 1935]]\n\nPollack states that Copland was gay and that the composer came to an early acceptance and understanding of his sexuality.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=234}} Like many at that time, Copland guarded his privacy, especially in regard to his homosexuality. He provided few written details about his private life and even after the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, showed no inclination to \"come out\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=236}} However, he was one of the few composers of his stature to live openly and travel with his intimates.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=238}} They tended to be talented, younger men involved in the arts, and the age-gap between them and the composer widened as he grew older.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=235}} Most became enduring friends after a few years and, in Pollack's words, \"remained a primary source of companionship\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=236}} Among Copland's love affairs were ones with photographer [[Victor Kraft (photographer)|Victor Kraft]], artist [[Alvin Ross]], pianist [[Paul Moor (pianist)|Paul Moor]], dancer [[Erik Johns]], composer [[John Brodbin Kennedy]],<ref>Aldrich and Wotherspoon, ''Who's who in gay and lesbian history'', London, 2000</ref> and painter [[Prentiss Taylor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/archives-of-american-arts-new-show-reveals-stories-of-gay-america-1951430/?no-ist |title=Archives of American Art's New Show Reveals Stories of Gay America |publisher=}}</ref><ref>Aaron Copland, The Selected Correspondence of Aaron Copland By Aaron Copland, pp.\u00a069\u201372.</ref>\n\nVictor Kraft became a constant in Copland's life, though their romance might have ended by 1944.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=241}} Originally a violin prodigy when the composer met him in 1932, Kraft gave up music to pursue a career in photography, in part due to Copland's urging.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=239\u201340}} Kraft would leave and re-enter Copland's life, often bringing much stress with him as his behavior became increasingly erratic, sometimes confrontational.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=243\u201344}} Kraft fathered a child to whom Copland later provided financial security, through a bequest from his estate.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=244}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Aaron Copland}}\n\nVivian Perlis, who collaborated with Copland on his autobiography, writes: \"Copland's method of composing was to write down fragments of musical ideas as they came to him. When he needed a piece, he would turn to these ideas (his 'gold nuggets').\"{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} if one or more of these nuggets looked promising, he would then write a piano sketch and eventually work on them at the keyboard.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} The piano, Perlis writes, \"was so integral to his composing that it permeated his compositional style, not only in the frequent use in the instrument but in more subtle and complex ways\".{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} His habit of turning to the keyboard tended to embarrass Copland until he learned that Stravinsky also did so.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}}\n\nCopland would not consider the specific instrumentation for a piece until it was complete and notated.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} Nor, according to Pollack, did he generally work in linear fashion, from beginning to end of a composition. Instead, he tended to compose whole sections in no particular order and surmise their eventual sequence after all those parts were complete, much like assembling a collage.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=10\u201311}} Copland himself admitted, \"I don't compose. I assemble materials.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} Many times, he included material he had written years earlier.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} If the situation dictated, as it did with his film scores, Copland could work quickly. Otherwise, he tended to write slowly whenever possible.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} Even with this deliberation, Copland considered composition, in his words, \"the product of the emotions\", which included  \"self-expression\" and \"self-discovery\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}}\n\n=== Influences ===\nWhile Copland's earliest musical inclinations as a teenager ran toward [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and the Russian composers, Copland's teacher and mentor Nadia Boulanger became his most important influence.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=49}} Copland especially admired Boulanger's total grasp of all classical music, and he was encouraged to experiment and develop a \"clarity of conception and elegance in proportion\". Following her model, he studied all periods of classical music and all forms\u2014from madrigals to symphonies. This breadth of vision led Copland to compose music for numerous settings\u2014orchestra, opera, solo piano, small ensemble, art song, ballet, theater and film. Boulanger particularly emphasized \"la grande ligne\" (the long line), \"a sense of forward motion&nbsp;... the feeling for inevitability, for the creating of an entire piece that could be thought of as a functioning entity\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=49}}\n\nDuring his studies with Boulanger in Paris, Copland was excited to be so close to the new post-Impressionistic French music of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]], and [[Erik Satie|Satie]], as well as [[Les six]], a group that included [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], and [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]]. [[Anton Webern|Webern]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] also impressed him. Copland was \"insatiable\" in seeking out the newest European music, whether in concerts, score reading or heated debate. These \"moderns\" were discarding the old laws of composition and experimenting with new forms, harmonies and rhythms, and including the use of jazz and quarter-tone music.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=39}} Milhaud was Copland's inspiration for some of his earlier \"jazzy\" works. He was also exposed to Schoenberg and admired his earlier atonal pieces, thinking Schoenberg's ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}} Above all others, Copland named Igor Stravinsky as his \"hero\" and his favorite 20th-century composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}} Copland especially admired Stravinsky's \"jagged and uncouth rhythmic effects\", \"bold use of dissonance\", and \"hard, dry, crackling sonority\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}}\n\nAnother inspiration for much of Copland's music was [[jazz]]. Although familiar with jazz back in America\u2014having listened to it and also played it in bands\u2014he fully realized its potential while traveling in Austria: \"The impression of jazz one receives in a foreign country is totally unlike the impression of such music heard in one's own country&nbsp;... when I heard jazz played in Vienna, it was like hearing it for the first time.\"{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=60}} He also found that the distance from his native country helped him see the United States more clearly. Beginning in 1923, he employed \"jazzy elements\" in his classical music, but by the late 1930s, he moved on to Latin and American folk tunes in his more successful pieces.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=120}} Although his early focus of jazz gave way to other influences, Copland continued to make use of jazz in more subtle ways in later works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=120}}\nCopland's work from the late 1940s onward included experimentation with Schoenberg's [[twelve-tone]] system, resulting in two major works, the Piano Quartet (1950) and the Piano Fantasy (1957).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=481}}\n\n=== Early works ===\nCopland's compositions before leaving for Paris were mainly short works for piano and [[art song]]s, inspired by Liszt and Debussy. In them, he experimented with ambiguous beginnings and endings, rapid key changes, and the frequent use of tritones.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=41}} His first published work, ''[[The Old Cat and the Young Mouse|The Cat and the Mouse]]''&nbsp;(1920), was a piece for piano solo based on the [[Jean de la Fontaine]] fable.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=51}} In ''Three Moods'' (1921), Copland's final movement is entitled \"Jazzy\", which he noted \"is based on two jazz melodies and ought to make the old professors sit up and take notice\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=44}}\n\nThe [[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (Copland)|Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]] established Copland as a serious modern composer. Musicologist Gayle Murchison cites Copland's use melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements endemic in jazz, which he would also use in his ''Music for the Theater'' and [[Piano Concerto (Copland)|Piano Concerto]] to evoke an essentially \"American\" sound.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48\u201354}} he fuses these qualities with modernist elements such as octatonic and whole-tone scales, polyrhythmic ostinato figures, and dissonant counterpoint.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48\u201354}} Murchinson points out the influence of Igor Stravinsky in the work's nervous, driving rhythms and some of its harmonic language.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48\u201354}} Copland in hindsight found the work too \"European\" as he consciously sought a more consciously American idiom to evoke in his future work.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=128}}\n\nVisits to Europe in 1926 and 1927 brought him into contact with the most recent developments there, including Webern's Five Pieces for Orchestra, which greatly impressed him. In August 1927, while staying in K\u00f6nigstein, Copland wrote ''Poet's Song'', a setting of a text by [[E.E. Cummings]] and his first composition using Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. This was followed by the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and the [[Piano Variations (Copland)|Piano Variations]] (1930), both of which rely on the exhaustive development of a single short motif. This procedure, which provided Copland with more formal flexibility and a greater emotional range than in his earlier music, is similar to Schoenberg's idea of \"continuous variation\" and, according to Copland's own admission, was influenced by the twelve-tone method, though neither work actually uses a twelve-tone row.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=68, 138, 147}}\n\nThe other major work of Copland's first period is the ''Short Symphony'' (1933). In it, music critic and musicologist [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]] writes, the \"jazz-influenced dislocations of meter that are so characteristic of Copland's music of the 1920s are more prevalent than ever\".{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=131}} Compared to the ''Symphonic Ode'', the orchestration is much leaner and the composition itself more concentrated.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=131}} In its combination and refinement of modernist and jazz elements, Steinberg calls the ''Short Symphony'' \"a remarkable synthesis of the learned and the vernacular, and thus, in all its brevity [the work last just 15 minutes], a singularly 'complete' representation of its composer\".{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=133}} However, Copland moved from this work toward more accessible works and folk sources.\n\n=== Populist works ===\nCopland wrote ''El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico'' between 1932 and 1936, which met with a popular acclaim that contrasted the relative obscurity of most of his previous works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=302}} Inspiration for this work came from Copland's vivid recollection of visiting the \"Salon Mexico\" dancehall where he witnessed a more intimate view of Mexico's nightlife.<ref>The Story Behind my El Salon Mexico https://www.jstor.org/stable/943608</ref> Copland derived his melodic material for this piece freely from two collections of Mexican folk tunes, changing pitches and varying rhythms.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=299}} The use of a folk tune with variations set in a symphonic context started a pattern he repeated in many of his most successful works right on through the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=300}} It also marked a shift in emphasis from a unified musical structure to the rhetorical effect the music might have on an audience and showed Copland refining a simplified, more accessible musical language.{{sfn|Crist|2005|p=43}}\n\n''El Sal\u00f3n'' prepared Copland to write the ballet score ''Billy the Kid'', which became, in Pollack's words, an \"archetypical depiction of the legendary American West\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=318\u201319, 325}} Based on a Walter Noble Burns novel, with choreography by Eugene Loring, ''Billy'' was among the first to display an American music and dance vocabulary.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=315}} Copland used six cowboy folk songs to provide period atmosphere and employed [[polyrhythm]] and [[polyharmony]] when not quoting these tunes literally to maintain the work's overall tone.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=317, 320}}{{sfn|Smith|1953|p= 189}} In this way, Copland's music worked much in the same way as the murals of [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], in that it employed elements that could be grasped easily by a mass audience.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=94}} The ballet premiered in New York in 1939, with Copland recalling: \"I cannot remember another work of mine that was so unanimously received.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=323}} Along with the ballet ''Rodeo'', ''Billy the Kid'' became, in the words of musicologist Elizabeth Crist, \"the basis for Copland's reputation as a composer of Americana\" and defines \"an uncomplicated form of American nationalism\".{{sfn|Crist|2005|p=111}}\n\nCopland's brand of nationalism in his ballets differed from that of European composers such as B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, who tried to preserve the folk tones they used as close to the original as possible.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=255\u201357}} Copland enhanced the tunes he used with contemporary rhythms, textures and structures. In what could seem contradictory, he used complex harmonies and rhythms to simplify folk melodies and make them more accessible and familiar to his listeners.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=255}} Except for the Shaker tune in ''Appalachian Spring'', Copland often [[syncopation|syncopates]] traditional melodies, changes their [[metre (music)|metric patterns]] and note values.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=256}} In ''Billy the Kid'', he derives many of the work's sparse harmonies from the implied harmonic constructions of the cowboy tunes themselves.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=256}}\n\nLike Stravinsky, Copland mastered the ability to create a coherent, integrated composition from what was essentially a mosaic of divergent folk-based and original elements.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=257}} In that sense, Copland's Populist works such as ''Billy the Kid'', ''Rodeo'', ''Appalachian Spring'' are not far removed from Stravinsky's ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=257\u201329}} Within that framework, however, Copland preserved the American atmosphere of these ballets through what musicologist Elliott Antokoletz calls \"the conservative handling of open diatonic sonorities\", which fosters \"a pastoral quality\" in the music.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}} This is especially true in the opening of ''Appalachian Spring'', where the harmonizations remain \"transparent and bare, suggested by the melodic disposition of the Shaker tune\".{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}} Variations which contrast to this tune in rhythm, key, texture and dynamics, fit within Copland's compositional practice of juxtaposing structural blocks.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}}\n\n=== Film scores ===\nWhen Hollywood beckoned concert hall composers in the 1930s with promises of better films and higher pay, Copland saw both a challenge for his abilities as a composer as well as an opportunity to expand his reputation and audience for his more serious works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=336}} In a departure from other film scores of the time, Copland's work largely reflected his own style, instead of the usual borrowing from the late-Romantic period.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=349}} He often avoided the full orchestra, and he rejected the common practice of using a [[leitmotiv]] to identify characters with their own personal themes. He instead matched a theme to the action, while avoiding the underlining of every action with exaggerated emphasis. Another technique Copland employed was to keep silent during intimate screen moments and only begin the music as a confirming motive toward the end of a scene.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=342}} Virgil Thomson wrote that the score for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' established \"the most distinguished populist musical style yet created in America\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=343}} Many composers who scored for western movies, particularly between 1940 and 1960, were influenced by Copland's style, though some also followed the late Romantic \"Max Steiner\" approach, which was considered more conventional and desirable.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=349}}{{sfn|Lerner|2001|p=491-99}}\n\n=== Later works ===\nCopland's work in the late 1940s and 1950s included use of Schoenberg's twelve-tone system, a development that he had recognized but not fully embraced. He had also believed the atonality of serialized music to run counter to his desire to reach a wide audience. Copland therefore approached dodecaphony with some initial skepticism.  While in Europe in 1949, he heard a number of serial works but did not admire much of it because \"so often it seemed that individuality was sacrificed to the method\".{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=151}} The music of French composer Pierre Boulez showed Copland that the technique could be separated from the \"old Wagnerian\" aesthetic with which he had associated it previously. Subsequent exposure to the late music of Austrian composer Anton Webern and twelve-tone pieces by Swiss composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] and Italian composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] strengthened this opinion.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=461}}\n\nCopland came to the conclusion that composing along serial lines was \"nothing more than an angle of vision. Like fugal treatment, it is a stimulus that enlivens musical thinking, especially when applied to a series of tones that lend themselves to that treatment.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=445\u201346}} He began his first serial work, the \"Piano Fantasy\", in 1951 to fulfill a commission from the young virtuoso pianist [[William Kapell]]. The piece became one of his most challenging works, over which he labored until 1957.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=445}} During the work's development, in 1953, Kapell died in an aircraft crash.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=481}} Critics lauded the \"Fantasy\" when it was finally premiered, calling the piece \"an outstanding addition to his own oeuvre and to contemporary piano literature\" and \"a tremendous achievement\". Jay Rosenfield stated: \"This is a new Copland to us, an artist advancing with strength and not building on the past alone.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=484\u201385}}\n\nSerialism allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices. Before he did this, according to musicologist Joseph Straus, the philosophical and compositional difference between non-tonal composers such as Schoenberg and tonal composers like Stravinsky had been considered too wide a gulf to bridge.{{sfn|Straus|2009|p=61}} Copland wrote that, to him, serialism pointed in two opposite directions, one \"toward the extreme of total organization with electronic applications\" and the other \"a gradual absorption into what had become a very ''freely interpreted tonalism'' [italics Copland]\".{{sfn|Straus|2009|pp=61\u201362}} The path he said he chose was the latter one, which he said, when he described his ''Piano Fantasy'', allowed him to incorporate \"elements able to be associated with the twelve-tone method and also with music tonally conceived\".{{sfn|Straus|2009|pp=61\u201362}} This practice differed markedly from Schoenberg, who used his tone rows as complete statements around which to structure his compositions.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=447}} Copland used his rows not much different than how he fashioned the material in his tonal pieces. He saw his rows as sources for melodies and harmonies, not as complete and independent entities, except at points in the musical structure that dictated the complete statement of a row.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=447}}\n\nEven after Copland started using 12-tone techniques, he did not stick to them exclusively but went back and forth between tonal and non-tonal compositions.{{sfn|Straus|2009|p=60}} Other late works include: ''[[Dance Panels]]'' (1959, ballet music), ''[[Something Wild (1961 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1961, his last film score, much of which would be later incorporated into his ''Music for a Great City''), ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' (1962, for the new Lincoln Center Philharmonic hall), ''Emblems'' (1964, for wind band), ''[[Night-Thoughts (piano piece)|Night Thoughts]]'' (1972, for the [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]]), and ''Proclamation'' (1982, his last work, started in 1973).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=487\u2013515}}\n\n== Critic, writer, teacher ==\nCopland did not consider himself a professional writer. He called his writing \"a byproduct of my trade\" as \"a kind of salesman for contemporary music\".{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=175}} As such, he wrote prolifically about music, including pieces on music criticism analysis, on musical trends, and on his own compositions.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=265}} An avid lecturer and lecturer-performer, Copland eventually collected his presentation notes into three books, ''What to Listen for in Music'' (1939), ''Our New Music'' (1941), and ''Music and Imagination'' (1952).{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=264}} In the 1980s, he collaborated with Vivian Perlis on a two-volume autobiography, ''Copland: 1900 Through 1942'' (1984) and ''Copland Since 1943'' (1989). Along with the composer's first-person narrative, these two books incorporate 11 \"interludes\" by Perlis and other sections from friends and peers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}} Some controversy arose over the second volume's increased reliance over the first on old documents for source material. Due to the then-advanced stage of Copland's Alzheimer's and the resulting memory loss, however, this fallback to previous material was inevitable.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}} The use in both books of letters and other unpublished sources, expertly researched and organized, made them what Pollack terms \"invaluable\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}}\n\nDuring his career, Copland met and helped hundreds of young composers, whom he met and who were drawn to him by his continual interest and acuity into the contemporary musical scene.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178\u201379}}{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=285}} This assistance came mainly outside an institutional framework\u2014other than his summers at the [[Berkshire Music Center]] at Tanglewood and a few semesters at Harvard and the State University of New York at Buffalo, Copland operated outside an academic setting.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=179}} Pollack writes: \"Those composers who actually studied with him were small in number and did so for only brief periods; rather, Copland helped younger composers more informally, with intermittent advice and aid.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=179}} This advice included focusing on expressive content rather than on purely technical points and on developing a personal style.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=290}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=194}}\n\nCopland's willingness to foster talent extended to critiquing scores in progress that were presented to him by his peers. Composer [[William Schuman]] writes: \"As a teacher, Aaron was extraordinary.... Copland would look at your music and try to understand what ''you'' were after [italics Schuman]. He didn't want to turn you into another Aaron Copland.... When he questioned something, it was in a manner that might make you want to question it yourself. Everything he said was helpful in making a younger composer realize the potential of a particular work. On the other hand, Aaron could be strongly critical.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=191\u201392}}\n\n== Conductor ==\nAlthough Copland studied conducting in Paris in 1921, he remained essentially a self-taught conductor with a very personal style.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=532}} Encouraged by Igor Stravinsky to master conducting and perhaps emboldened by Carlos Chavez's efforts in Mexico, he began to direct his own works on his international travels in the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=533}} By the 1950s, he was also conducting the works of other composers, and after a televised appearance where he directed the New York Philharmonic, Copland became in high demand.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=534}} He placed a strong emphasis in his programs on [[20th-century music]] and lesser-known composers, and until the 1970s rarely planned concerts to feature his music exclusively.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=535\u201336}} Performers and audiences generally greeted his conducting appearances as positive opportunities to hear his music as the composer intended. His efforts on behalf of other composers could be penetrating but also uneven.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=538\u201339}}\n\nUnderstated on the podium, Copland modeled his style after other composer/conductors such as Stravinsky and [[Paul Hindemith]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=536}} Critics wrote of his precision and clarity before an orchestra.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=536}} Observers noted that he had \"none of the typical conductorial vanities\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=537}} Copland's unpretentious charm was appreciated by professional musicians but some criticized his \"unsteady\" beat and \"unexciting\" interpretations.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=537\u201338}} Koussevitzky advised him to \"stay home and compose\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=533\u201334}} Copland at times asked for conducting advice from Bernstein, who occasionally joked that Copland could conduct his works \"a little better.\" Bernstein also noted that Copland improved over time, and he considered him a more natural conductor than Stravinsky or Hindemith.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=533, 538}}{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=172}} Eventually, Copland recorded nearly all his orchestral works with himself conducting.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=535}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nCopland wrote a total of about 100 works which covered a diverse range of genres. Many of these compositions, especially orchestral pieces, have remained part of the standard American repertoire.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=555}} According to Pollack, Copland \"had perhaps the most distinctive and identifiable musical voice produced by this country so far, an individuality ... that helped define for many what American concert music sounds like at its most characteristic and that exerted enormous influence on multitudes of contemporaries and successors.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=555}}  His synthesis of influences and inclinations helped create the \"Americanism\" of his music.{{sfn|Smith|1953|pp=292\u201394}} The composer himself pointed out, in summarizing the American character of his music, \"the optimistic tone\", \"his love of rather large canvases\", \"a certain directness in expression of sentiment\", and \"a certain songfulness\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=530}}\n\nWhile \"Copland's musical rhetoric has become iconic\" and \"has functioned as a mirror of America,\" conductor [[Leon Botstein]] suggests that the composer \"helped define the modern consciousness of America's ideals, character and sense of place. The notion that his music played not a subsidiary but a central role in the shaping of the national consciousness makes Copland uniquely interesting, for the historian as well as the musician.\"{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=442}} Composer [[Ned Rorem]] states, \"Aaron stressed simplicity: Remove, remove, remove what isn't needed....

Copland was referred to by his peers and critics as \"the Dean of American Composers\". The open, slowly changing harmonies in much of his music are typical of what many people consider to be the sound of American music, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit. He is best known for the works he wrote in the 1930s and 1940s in a deliberately accessible style often referred to as \"populist\" and which the composer labeled his \"vernacular\" style.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=186}} Works in this vein include the ballets ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'', ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' and ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]'', his ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' and [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]]. In addition to his ballets and orchestral works, he produced music in many other genres, including chamber music, vocal works, opera and film scores.\n\nAfter some initial studies with composer [[Rubin Goldmark]], Copland traveled to Paris, where he first studied with [[Isidor Philipp]] and [[Paul Vidal]], then with noted [[pedagogue]] [[Nadia Boulanger]]. He studied three years with Boulanger, whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste. Determined upon his return to the U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer, Copland gave lecture-recitals, wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing. However, he found that composing orchestral music in the [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] style, which he had adopted while studying abroad, was a financially-contradictory approach, particularly in light of the [[Great Depression]]. He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of {{lang|de|[[Gebrauchsmusik]]}} (\"music for use\"), music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes. During the Depression years, he traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico, formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]] and began composing his signature works.\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Copland became aware that [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and other fellow composers had begun to study [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s use of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone (serial) techniques]]. After he had been exposed to the works of French composer [[Pierre Boulez]], he incorporated serial techniques into his ''Piano Quartet'' (1950), ''Piano Fantasy'' (1957), ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' for orchestra (1961) and ''[[Inscape (Copland)|Inscape]]'' for orchestra (1967). Unlike Schoenberg, Copland used his tone rows in much the same fashion as his tonal material\u2014as sources for melodies and harmonies, rather than as complete statements in their own right, except for crucial events from a structural point of view. From the 1960s onward, Copland's activities turned more from composing to conducting. He became a frequent guest conductor of orchestras in the U.S. and the UK and made a series of recordings of his music, primarily for [[Columbia Records]].\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Aaron Copland School of Music (541691170).jpg|thumb|Aaron Copland School of Music, Queens College (part of the [[City University of New York]])]]\nAaron Copland was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on November 14, 1900.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=15}} He was the youngest of five children in a [[Conservative Jewish]] family of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] origins.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=19}} While emigrating from Russia to the United States, Copland's father, Harris Morris Copland, lived and worked in Scotland for two to three years to pay for his boat fare to the US. It was there that Copland's father may have [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] his surname \"Kaplan\" to \"Copland\", though Copland himself believed for many years that the change had been due to an [[Ellis Island]] immigration official when his father entered the country.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=15}}<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |jstor=832353 |title=Conversation with Aaron Copland |first1=Edward T. |last1=Cone |first2=Aaron |last2=Copland |date=January 1, 1968 |journal=Perspectives of New Music |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=57\u201372 |doi=10.2307/832353}}</ref> Copland was however unaware until late in his life that the family name had been Kaplan, and his parents never told him this.<ref name=\"jstor.org\" /> Throughout his childhood, Copland and his family lived above his parents' [[Brooklyn]] shop, H.M.

His father was a staunch Democrat. The family members were active in [[Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes]], where Aaron celebrated his [[Bar Mitzvah]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=26}} Not especially athletic, the sensitive young man became an avid reader and often read [[Horatio Alger]] stories on his front steps.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=15}}\n\nCopland's father had no musical interest. His mother, Sarah Mittenthal Copland, sang, played the piano, and arranged for music lessons for her children.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=19}} Of his siblings, oldest brother Ralph was the most advanced musically, proficient on the violin. His sister Laurine had the strongest connection with Aaron; she gave him his first piano lessons, promoted his musical education, and supported him in his musical career.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=19}} A student at the Metropolitan Opera School and a frequent opera-goer, Laurine also brought home [[libretti]] for Aaron to study.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=17}} Copland attended [[Boys High School (Brooklyn)|Boys High School]] and in the summer went to various camps. Most of his early exposure to music was at Jewish weddings and ceremonies, and occasional family musicales.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=26}}\n\nCopland began writing songs at the age of eight and a half.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}} His earliest notated music, about seven bars he wrote when age 11, was for an opera scenario he created and called ''Zenatello''.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=32}} From 1913 to 1917 he took piano lessons with Leopold Wolfsohn, who taught him the standard classical fare.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=22}} Copland's first public music performance was at a [[Wanamaker's]] recital.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=18}}{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=23}} By the age of 15, after attending a concert by composer-pianist [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], Copland decided to become a composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=33}} After attempts to further his music study from a [[correspondence course]], Copland took formal lessons in [[harmony]], [[music theory|theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] from [[Rubin Goldmark]], a noted teacher and composer of American music (who had given [[George Gershwin]] three lessons). Goldmark, with whom Copland studied between 1917 and 1921, gave the young Copland a solid foundation, especially in the Germanic tradition.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=34}} As Copland stated later: \"This was a stroke of luck for me. I was spared the floundering that so many musicians have suffered through incompetent teaching.\"{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=23}} But Copland also commented that the maestro had \"little sympathy for the advanced musical idioms of the day\" and his \"approved\" composers ended with [[Richard Strauss]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=35}}\n\nCopland's graduation piece from his studies with Goldmark was a three-movement piano [[sonata]] in a [[Romantic music|Romantic style]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=36}} But he had also composed more original and daring pieces which he did not share with his teacher.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=37}} In addition to regularly attending the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[New York Symphony]], where he heard the standard classical repertory, Copland continued his musical development through an expanding circle of musical friends. After graduating from high school, Copland played in dance bands.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=39}} Continuing his musical education, he received further piano lessons from Victor Wittgenstein, who found his student to be \"quiet, shy, well-mannered, and gracious in accepting criticism\".{{sfn|Smith|1953|pp=25, 31}} Copland's fascination with the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and its promise for freeing the lower classes drew a rebuke from his father and uncles.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=30}} In spite of that, in his early adult life Copland would develop friendships with people with socialist and communist leanings.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=237}}\n\n=== Study in Paris ===\n[[File:Nadia Boulanger 1925.jpg|thumb|Nadia Boulanger in 1925]]\nCopland's passion for the latest European music, plus glowing letters from his friend Aaron Schaffer, inspired him to go to Paris for further study.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=33}} An article in ''[[Musical America]]'' about a summer school program for American musicians at the [[Fontainebleau School of Music]], offered by the French government, encouraged Copland still further.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=35}} His father wanted him to go to college, but his mother's vote in the family conference allowed him to give Paris a try. On arriving in [[France]], he studied at Fontainebleau with pianist and pedagogue [[Isidor Philipp]] and composer [[Paul Vidal]]. When Copland found Vidal too much like Goldmark, he switched at the suggestion of a fellow student to [[Nadia Boulanger]], then aged 34.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|pp=47\u201348, 50}} He had initial reservations: \"No one to my knowledge had ever before thought of studying with a woman.\"{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=41}} She interviewed him, and recalled later: \"One could tell his talent immediately.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=41}}\n\nBoulanger had as many as 40 students at once and employed a formal regimen that Copland had to follow. Copland found her incisive mind much to his liking and found her ability to critique a composition impeccable. Boulanger \"could always find the weak spot in a place you suspected was weak.... She could also tell you ''why'' it was weak [italics Copland].\"{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=63}} He wrote in a letter to his brother Ralph, \"This intellectual Amazon is not only professor at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]], is not only familiar with all music from Bach to Stravinsky, but is prepared for anything worse in the way of dissonance. But make no mistake&nbsp;... A more charming womanly woman never lived.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=47}} Copland later wrote that \"it was wonderful for me to find a teacher with such openness of mind, while at the same time she held firm ideas of right and wrong in musical matters. The confidence she had in my talents and her belief in me were at the very least flattering and more\u2014they were crucial to my development at this time of my career.\"{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=64}} Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste.\n\nAlong with his studies with Boulanger, Copland took classes in French language and history at the [[Sorbonne]], attended plays, and frequented [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], the English-language bookstore that was a gathering-place for expatriate American writers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=54\u201355}} Among this group in the heady cultural atmosphere of Paris in the 1920s were [[Paul Bowles]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Ezra Pound]], as well as artists like [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marc Chagall]], and [[Amedeo Modigliani]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=51}} Also influential on the new music were the French intellectuals [[Marcel Proust]], [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]]; the latter cited by Copland as being his personal favorite and most read.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=53\u201354}} Travels to Italy, Austria, and Germany rounded out Copland's musical education. During his stay in Paris, Copland began writing musical critiques, the first on [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]], which helped spread his fame and stature in the music community.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=62}}\n\n=== 1925 to 1935 ===\n[[File:Kousewitzky.gif|thumb|left|[[Serge Koussevitzky]] was a mentor and supporter of Copland]]\nInstead of wallowing in self-pity and self-destruction like many of the expatriate members of the [[Lost Generation]], Copland returned to America optimistic and enthusiastic about the future, determined to make his way as a full-time composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=55}} He rented a studio apartment on New York City's [[Upper West Side]] in the [[The Empire Hotel (New York City)|Empire Hotel]], close to [[Carnegie Hall]] and other musical venues and publishers. He remained in that area for the next thirty years, later moving to [[Westchester County, New York]]. Copland lived frugally and survived financially with help from two $2,500 [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s in 1925 and 1926 ({{Inflation|US|2500|1925|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=89}} Lecture-recitals, awards, appointments, and small commissions, plus some teaching, writing, and personal loans kept him afloat in the subsequent years through World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=90}} Also important, especially during the Depression, were wealthy patrons who underwrote performances, helped pay for publication of works and promoted musical events and composers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=90}} Among those mentors was [[Serge Koussevitzky]], the music director of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and known as a champion of \"new music\". Koussevitsky would prove to be influential in Copland's life, perhaps the second most important after Boulanger.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=121\u201322}} Beginning with the [[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (Copland)|Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]] (1924), Koussevitzky would perform more of Copland's music than that of any the composer's contemporaries, even while other conductors programmed only a few of Copland's works{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=123}}\n\nSoon after his return, Copland was exposed to the artistic circle of photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]]. While Copland did not care for Stieglitz's domineering attitude, he admired his work and took to heart Stieglitz's conviction that American artists should reflect \"the ideas of American Democracy\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=101}} This ideal influenced not just the composer but also a generation of artists and photographers, including [[Paul Strand]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Walker Evans]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=101}} Evans' photographs inspired portions of Copland's opera ''[[The Tender Land]]''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=103}}\n\nIn his quest to take up the slogan of the Stieglitz group, \"Affirm America\", Copland found only the music of [[Carl Ruggles]] and [[Charles Ives]] upon which to draw.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=101, 110}} Without what Copland called a \"usable past\", he looked toward jazz and popular music, something he had already started to do while in Europe.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=113}}  In the 1920s, [[George Gershwin]], [[Bessie Smith]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] were in the forefront American popular music and jazz.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=115\u201316}} By the end of the decade, Copland felt his music was going in a more abstract, less jazz-oriented direction.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|pp=134\u201335}} However, as large swing bands such as those of [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Glenn Miller]] became popular in the 1930s, Copland took a renewed interest in the genre.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Alfred Stieglitz 1935 Apr 17.jpg|thumb|Copland admired the work and philosophy of [[Alfred Stieglitz]] ]]\nInspired by the example of [[Les Six]] in France, Copland sought out contemporaries such as [[Roger Sessions]], [[Roy Harris]], [[Virgil Thomson]], and [[Walter Piston]], and quickly established himself as a spokesman for composers of his generation.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=159}} He also helped found the Copland-Sessions Concerts to showcase these composers' chamber works to new audiences.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=166\u201367}} Copland's relationship with these men, who became known as \"commando unit\" was one of both support and rivalry, and he played a key role in keeping them together until after World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=176}} He was also generous with his time with nearly every American young composer he met during his life, later earning the title, \"Dean of American Music\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 215}}\n\nWith the knowledge he had gained from his studies in Paris, Copland came into demand as a lecturer and writer on contemporary European [[classical music]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} From 1927 to 1930 and 1935 to 1938, he taught classes at [[The New School|The New School of Social Research]] in New York City.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} Eventually, his New School lectures would appear in the form of two books\u2014''What to Listen for in Music'' (1937, revised 1957) and ''Our New Music'' (1940, revised 1968 and retitled ''The New Music: 1900\u20131960'').{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}} During this period, Copland also wrote regularly for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' and a number of other journals. These articles would appear in 1969 as the book ''Copland on Music''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=58}}\n\nCopland's compositions in the early 1920s reflected the modernist attitude that prevailed among intellectuals, that the arts need be accessible to only a cadre of the enlightened and that the masses would come to appreciate their efforts over time. However, mounting troubles with the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and ''Short Symphony'' (1933) caused him to rethink this approach. It was financially contradictory, particularly in the Depression. Avant-garde music had lost what cultural historian [[Morris Dickstein]] calls \"its buoyant experimental edge\" and the national mood toward it had changed.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} As biographer [[Howard Pollack]] points out,{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=158}}\n<blockquote>\nCopland observed two trends among composers in the 1930s: first, a continuing attempt to \"simplify their musical language\" and, second, a desire to \"make contact\" with as wide an audience as possible. Since 1927, he had been in the process of simplifying, or at least paring down, his musical language, though in such a manner as to sometimes have the effect, paradoxically, of estranging audiences and performers. By 1933 ... he began to find ways to make his starkly personal language accessible to a surprisingly large number of people.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn many ways, this shift mirrored the German idea of {{lang|de|[[Gebrauchsmusik]]}} (\"music for use\"), as composers sought to create music that could serve a utilitarian as well as artistic purpose. This approach encompassed two trends: first, music that students could easily learn, and second, music which would have wider appeal, such as incidental music for plays, movies, radio, etc.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=162}} Toward this end, Copland provided musical advice and inspiration to [[Group Theatre (New York)|The Group Theatre]], a company which also attracted [[Stella Adler]], [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Lee Strasberg]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=258}} Philosophically an outgrowth of Stieglitz and his ideals, the Group focused on socially-relevant plays by the American authors.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=257}} Through it and later his work in film, Copland met several major American playwrights, including [[Thornton Wilder]], [[William Inge]], [[Arthur Miller]], and [[Edward Albee]], and considered projects with all of them.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=267}}\n\n=== 1935 to 1950 ===\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename     = Aron Copland Appalachian Spring Opening original version for 13 instruments.ogg\n| title        = Opening: ''Appalachian Spring'', original version for 13 instruments\n| description  = Sample of the opening movement in Copland's ballet}}\n\nAround 1935 Copland began to compose musical pieces for young audiences, in accordance with the first goal of American Gebrauchsmusik.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=303}} These works included piano pieces (''The Young Pioneers'') and an opera (''[[The Second Hurricane]]'').{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=303\u201305}} During the Depression years, Copland traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico. He formed an important friendship with Mexican composer [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]] and would return often to Mexico for working vacations conducting engagements.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178, 226}} During his initial visit to Mexico, Copland began composing the first of his signature works, ''[[El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]]'', which he completed in 1936. In it and in ''The Second Hurricane'' Copland began \"experimenting\", as he phrased it, with a simpler, more accessible style.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=245}} This and other incidental commissions fulfilled the second goal of American Gebrauchsmusik, creating music of wide appeal.\n\n[[File:Carlos Chavez.jpg|thumb|Carlos Ch\u00e1vez in 1937]]\nConcurrent with ''The Second Hurricane'', Copland composed (for radio broadcast) \"Prairie Journal\" on a commission from the [[Columbia Broadcast System]].{{Sfn|Pollack|1999|p=310}} This was one of his first pieces to convey the landscape of the American West.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=312}} This emphasis on the frontier carried over to his ballet ''[[Billy the Kid (ballet)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1938), which along with ''El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico'' became his first widespread public success.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=187}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=323}} Copland's ballet music established him as an authentic composer of American music much as Stravinsky's ballet scores connected the composer with Russian music and came at an opportune time.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=184}} He helped fill a vacuum for American choreographers to fill their dance repertory{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=185}} and tapped into an artistic groundswell, from the motion pictures of [[Busby Berkeley]] and [[Fred Astaire]] to the ballets of [[George Balanchine]] and [[Martha Graham]], to both democratize and Americanize dance as an art form.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=94}} In 1939, Copland completed his first two Hollywood film scores, for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'', and composed the radio score \"John Henry\", based on [[John Henry (folklore)|the folk ballad]].{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=169}}\n\nWhile these works and others like them that would follow were accepted by the listening public at large, detractors accused Copland of pandering to the masses.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=308, 336}} Music critic [[Paul Rosenfeld]], for one, warned in 1939 that Copland was \"standing in the fork in the highroad, the two branches of which lead respectively to popular and artistic success.\"{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=338}}  Even some of the composer's friends, such as composer [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]], were confused about Copland's simpler style.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=336}} One, composer [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], went so far as to lecture Copland: \"By having sold out to the mongrel commercialists half-way already, the danger is going to be wider for you, and I beg you dear Aaron, don't sell out [entirely] yet.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=190}} Copland's response was that his writing as he did and in as many genres was his response to how the Depression had affected society, as well as to new media and the audiences made available by these new media.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=308\u201309}} As he himself phrased it, \"The composer who is frightened of losing his artistic integrity through contact with a mass audience is no longer aware of the meaning of the word art.\"{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=338}}\n\nThe 1940s were arguably Copland's most productive years, and some of his works from this period would cement his worldwide fame. His ballet scores for ''[[Rodeo (Copland)|Rodeo]]'' (1942) and ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'' (1944) were huge successes. His pieces ''[[Lincoln Portrait]]'' and ''[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]'' became patriotic standards. Also important was the [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Third Symphony]]. Composed in a two-year period from 1944 to 1946, it became Copland's best-known symphony.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=410, 418}} The [[Clarinet Concerto (Copland)|Clarinet Concerto]] (1948), scored for solo clarinet, strings, harp, and piano, was a commission piece for bandleader and clarinetist Benny Goodman and a complement to Copland's earlier jazz-influenced work, the [[Piano Concerto (Copland)|Piano Concerto]] (1926).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=424}} His ''Four Piano Blues'' is an introspective composition with a jazz influence.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=427}} Copland finished the 1940s with two film scores, one for [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Heiress]]'' and one for the [[The Red Pony (1949 film)|film adaptation]] of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Red Pony]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=202}}\n\nIn 1949, Copland returned to Europe, where he found French composer Pierre Boulez dominating the group of post-war avant-garde composers there.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=460}} He also met with proponents of twelve-tone technique, based on the works of Arnold Schoenberg, and found himself interested in adapting serial methods to his own musical voice.\n\n=== 1950s and 1960s ===\nIn 1950, Copland received a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission]] scholarship to study in Rome, which he did the following year. Around this time, he also composed his Piano Quartet, adopting Schoenberg's twelve-tone method of composition, and ''[[Old American Songs]]'' (1950), the first set of which was premiered by Peter Pears and [[Benjamin Britten]], the second by [[William Warfield]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=467}} During the 1951\u201352 academic year, Copland gave a series of lectures under the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Professorship]] at [[Harvard University]]. These lectures were published as the book ''Music and Imagination''.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=170}}\n\n[[File:Aaron Copland 1962.JPG|thumb|left|Aaron Copland in 1962 from a television special]]\nBecause of his [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] views, which had included his support of the [[Communist Party USA]] ticket during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]] and his strong support of [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]] during the 1948 presidential election, Copland was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] during the [[McCarthyism|Red scare]] of the 1950s.  He was included on an FBI list of 151 artists thought to have Communist associations and found himself [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], with ''A Lincoln Portrait'' withdrawn from the 1953 inaugural concert for President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=452}} Called later that year to a private hearing at the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Copland was questioned by [[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[Roy Cohn]] about his lecturing abroad and his affiliations with various organizations and events.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=455\u201377}} In the process, McCarthy and Cohn neglected completely Copland's works, which made a virtue of American values.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=452, 456}} Outraged by the accusations, many members of the musical community held up Copland's music as a banner of his patriotism. The investigations ceased in 1955 and were closed in 1975.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=458}}\n\nThe McCarthy probes did not seriously affect Copland's career and international artistic reputation, taxing of his time, energy, and emotional state as they might have been.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=458}} Nevertheless, beginning in 1950, Copland\u2014who had been appalled at Stalin's persecution of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] and other artists\u2014began resigning from participation in leftist groups.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=285}} Copland, Pollack states, \"stayed particularly concerned about the role of the artist in society\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=286}} He decried the lack of artistic freedom in the Soviet Union, and in his 1954 Norton lecture he asserted that loss of freedom under Soviet Communism deprived artists of \"the immemorial right of the artist to be wrong\". He began to vote Democratic, first for Stevenson and then for Kennedy.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=285}}\n\nPotentially more damaging for Copland was a sea-change in artistic tastes, away from the Populist mores that infused his work of the 1930s and 40s.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} Beginning in the 1940s, intellectuals assailed Popular Front culture, to which Copland's music was linked, and labeled it, in Dickstein's words, as \"hopelessly middlebrow, a [[dumbing down]] of art into toothless entertainment\".{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} They often linked their disdain for Populist art with technology, new media and mass audiences\u2014in other words, the areas of radio, television and motion pictures, for which Copland either had or soon would write music, as well as his popular ballets.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}} While these attacks actually began at the end of the 1930s with the writings of [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Dwight Macdonald]] for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', they were based in anti-Stalinist politics and would accelerate in the decades following World War II.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=91}}\n\nDespite any difficulties that his suspected Communist sympathies might have posed, Copland traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 60s to observe the [[avant-garde]] styles of Europe, hear compositions by Soviet composers not well known in the West and experience the new school of Polish music.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=462\u201364}} While in Japan, he was taken with the work of [[Toru Takemitsu]] and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=464\u201365}} Copland revised his text \"The New Music\" with comments on the styles that he encountered.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=465\u201366}} He found much of what he heard dull and impersonal.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=466}} [[Electronic music]] seemed to have \"a depressing sameness of sound,\" while [[aleatoric music]] was for those \"who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=465}} As he summarized, \"I've spent most of my life trying to get the right note in the right place. Just throwing it open to chance seems to go against my natural instincts.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=465}}\n\nIn 1952, Copland received a commission from the [[League of Composers]], funded by a grant from [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], to write an opera for television.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} While Copland was aware of the potential pitfalls of that genre, which included weak libretti and demanding production values, he had also been thinking about writing an opera since the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} Among the subjects he had considered were [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s ''[[An American Tragedy]]'' and [[Frank Norris]]'s ''[[McTeague]]''{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} He finally settled on [[James Agee]]'s ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'', which seemed appropriate for the more intimate setting of television and could also be used in the \"college trade\", with more schools mounting operas than they had before World War II.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=470}} The resulting opera, ''[[The Tender Land]]'' was written in two acts but later expanded to three. As Copland feared, critics found the libretto to be weak when the opera premiered in 1954.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=478}} In spite of its flaws, the opera became one of the few American operas to enter the standard repertory.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=478}}\n\nIn 1957, 1958, and 1976, Copland was the Music Director of the [[Ojai Music Festival]], a classical and contemporary music festival in [[Ojai, California]].<ref>[http://www.ojaifestival.org/music-directors-2/ Music Directors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701064355/http://www.ojaifestival.org/music-directors-2/ |date=July 1, 2013 }}, Ojai Music Festival.</ref> For the occasion of the [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial|Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial]], Copland composed ''Ceremonial Fanfare For Brass Ensemble'' to accompany the exhibition \"Masterpieces Of Fifty Centuries\".

Throw the artist \"into a mood of suspicion, ill-will, and dread that typifies the cold war attitude and he'll create nothing\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=284\u201385}}\n\nWhile Copland had various encounters with organized religious thought, which influenced some of his early compositions, he remained [[agnostic]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=28, 328}} He was close with the Zionism during the Popular Front movement, when it was endorsed by the left. Pollack writes,{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=27\u201328}}\n<blockquote>\nLike many contemporaries, Copland regarded Judaism alternately in terms of religion, culture, and race; but he showed relatively little involvement in any aspect of his Jewish heritage.... At the same time, he had ties to Christianity, identifying with such profoundly Christian writers as [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and often spending Christmas Day at home with a special dinner with close friends.... In general, his music seemed to evoke Protestant hymns as often as it did Jewish chant....Copland characteristically found connections among various religious traditions.... But if Copland was discreet about his Jewish background, he never hid it, either.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Victor Kraft, 1935.jpg|thumb|Victor Kraft, 1935]]\n\nPollack states that Copland was gay and that the composer came to an early acceptance and understanding of his sexuality.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=234}} Like many at that time, Copland guarded his privacy, especially in regard to his homosexuality. He provided few written details about his private life and even after the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, showed no inclination to \"come out\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=236}} However, he was one of the few composers of his stature to live openly and travel with his intimates.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=238}} They tended to be talented, younger men involved in the arts, and the age-gap between them and the composer widened as he grew older.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=235}} Most became enduring friends after a few years and, in Pollack's words, \"remained a primary source of companionship\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=236}} Among Copland's love affairs were ones with photographer [[Victor Kraft (photographer)|Victor Kraft]], artist [[Alvin Ross]], pianist [[Paul Moor (pianist)|Paul Moor]], dancer [[Erik Johns]], composer [[John Brodbin Kennedy]],<ref>Aldrich and Wotherspoon, ''Who's who in gay and lesbian history'', London, 2000</ref> and painter [[Prentiss Taylor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/archives-of-american-arts-new-show-reveals-stories-of-gay-america-1951430/?no-ist |title=Archives of American Art's New Show Reveals Stories of Gay America |publisher=}}</ref><ref>Aaron Copland, The Selected Correspondence of Aaron Copland By Aaron Copland, pp.\u00a069\u201372.</ref>\n\nVictor Kraft became a constant in Copland's life, though their romance might have ended by 1944.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=241}} Originally a violin prodigy when the composer met him in 1932, Kraft gave up music to pursue a career in photography, in part due to Copland's urging.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=239\u201340}} Kraft would leave and re-enter Copland's life, often bringing much stress with him as his behavior became increasingly erratic, sometimes confrontational.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=243\u201344}} Kraft fathered a child to whom Copland later provided financial security, through a bequest from his estate.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=244}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Aaron Copland}}\n\nVivian Perlis, who collaborated with Copland on his autobiography, writes: \"Copland's method of composing was to write down fragments of musical ideas as they came to him. When he needed a piece, he would turn to these ideas (his 'gold nuggets').\"{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} if one or more of these nuggets looked promising, he would then write a piano sketch and eventually work on them at the keyboard.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} The piano, Perlis writes, \"was so integral to his composing that it permeated his compositional style, not only in the frequent use in the instrument but in more subtle and complex ways\".{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} His habit of turning to the keyboard tended to embarrass Copland until he learned that Stravinsky also did so.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}}\n\nCopland would not consider the specific instrumentation for a piece until it was complete and notated.{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=255}} Nor, according to Pollack, did he generally work in linear fashion, from beginning to end of a composition. Instead, he tended to compose whole sections in no particular order and surmise their eventual sequence after all those parts were complete, much like assembling a collage.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=10\u201311}} Copland himself admitted, \"I don't compose. I assemble materials.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} Many times, he included material he had written years earlier.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} If the situation dictated, as it did with his film scores, Copland could work quickly. Otherwise, he tended to write slowly whenever possible.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}} Even with this deliberation, Copland considered composition, in his words, \"the product of the emotions\", which included  \"self-expression\" and \"self-discovery\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=11}}\n\n=== Influences ===\nWhile Copland's earliest musical inclinations as a teenager ran toward [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and the Russian composers, Copland's teacher and mentor Nadia Boulanger became his most important influence.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=49}} Copland especially admired Boulanger's total grasp of all classical music, and he was encouraged to experiment and develop a \"clarity of conception and elegance in proportion\". Following her model, he studied all periods of classical music and all forms\u2014from madrigals to symphonies. This breadth of vision led Copland to compose music for numerous settings\u2014orchestra, opera, solo piano, small ensemble, art song, ballet, theater and film. Boulanger particularly emphasized \"la grande ligne\" (the long line), \"a sense of forward motion&nbsp;... the feeling for inevitability, for the creating of an entire piece that could be thought of as a functioning entity\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=49}}\n\nDuring his studies with Boulanger in Paris, Copland was excited to be so close to the new post-Impressionistic French music of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]], and [[Erik Satie|Satie]], as well as [[Les six]], a group that included [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], and [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]]. [[Anton Webern|Webern]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] also impressed him. Copland was \"insatiable\" in seeking out the newest European music, whether in concerts, score reading or heated debate. These \"moderns\" were discarding the old laws of composition and experimenting with new forms, harmonies and rhythms, and including the use of jazz and quarter-tone music.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=39}} Milhaud was Copland's inspiration for some of his earlier \"jazzy\" works. He was also exposed to Schoenberg and admired his earlier atonal pieces, thinking Schoenberg's ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}} Above all others, Copland named Igor Stravinsky as his \"hero\" and his favorite 20th-century composer.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}} Copland especially admired Stravinsky's \"jagged and uncouth rhythmic effects\", \"bold use of dissonance\", and \"hard, dry, crackling sonority\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=65}}\n\nAnother inspiration for much of Copland's music was [[jazz]]. Although familiar with jazz back in America\u2014having listened to it and also played it in bands\u2014he fully realized its potential while traveling in Austria: \"The impression of jazz one receives in a foreign country is totally unlike the impression of such music heard in one's own country&nbsp;... when I heard jazz played in Vienna, it was like hearing it for the first time.\"{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=60}} He also found that the distance from his native country helped him see the United States more clearly. Beginning in 1923, he employed \"jazzy elements\" in his classical music, but by the late 1930s, he moved on to Latin and American folk tunes in his more successful pieces.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=120}} Although his early focus of jazz gave way to other influences, Copland continued to make use of jazz in more subtle ways in later works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=120}}\nCopland's work from the late 1940s onward included experimentation with Schoenberg's [[twelve-tone]] system, resulting in two major works, the Piano Quartet (1950) and the Piano Fantasy (1957).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=481}}\n\n=== Early works ===\nCopland's compositions before leaving for Paris were mainly short works for piano and [[art song]]s, inspired by Liszt and Debussy. In them, he experimented with ambiguous beginnings and endings, rapid key changes, and the frequent use of tritones.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=41}} His first published work, ''[[The Old Cat and the Young Mouse|The Cat and the Mouse]]''&nbsp;(1920), was a piece for piano solo based on the [[Jean de la Fontaine]] fable.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=51}} In ''Three Moods'' (1921), Copland's final movement is entitled \"Jazzy\", which he noted \"is based on two jazz melodies and ought to make the old professors sit up and take notice\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=44}}\n\nThe [[Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (Copland)|Symphony for Organ and Orchestra]] established Copland as a serious modern composer. Musicologist Gayle Murchison cites Copland's use melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements endemic in jazz, which he would also use in his ''Music for the Theater'' and [[Piano Concerto (Copland)|Piano Concerto]] to evoke an essentially \"American\" sound.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48\u201354}} he fuses these qualities with modernist elements such as octatonic and whole-tone scales, polyrhythmic ostinato figures, and dissonant counterpoint.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48\u201354}} Murchinson points out the influence of Igor Stravinsky in the work's nervous, driving rhythms and some of its harmonic language.{{sfn|Murchison|2012|pp=48\u201354}} Copland in hindsight found the work too \"European\" as he consciously sought a more consciously American idiom to evoke in his future work.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=128}}\n\nVisits to Europe in 1926 and 1927 brought him into contact with the most recent developments there, including Webern's Five Pieces for Orchestra, which greatly impressed him. In August 1927, while staying in K\u00f6nigstein, Copland wrote ''Poet's Song'', a setting of a text by [[E.E. Cummings]] and his first composition using Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. This was followed by the ''Symphonic Ode'' (1929) and the [[Piano Variations (Copland)|Piano Variations]] (1930), both of which rely on the exhaustive development of a single short motif. This procedure, which provided Copland with more formal flexibility and a greater emotional range than in his earlier music, is similar to Schoenberg's idea of \"continuous variation\" and, according to Copland's own admission, was influenced by the twelve-tone method, though neither work actually uses a twelve-tone row.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=68, 138, 147}}\n\nThe other major work of Copland's first period is the ''Short Symphony'' (1933). In it, music critic and musicologist [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]] writes, the \"jazz-influenced dislocations of meter that are so characteristic of Copland's music of the 1920s are more prevalent than ever\".{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=131}} Compared to the ''Symphonic Ode'', the orchestration is much leaner and the composition itself more concentrated.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=131}} In its combination and refinement of modernist and jazz elements, Steinberg calls the ''Short Symphony'' \"a remarkable synthesis of the learned and the vernacular, and thus, in all its brevity [the work last just 15 minutes], a singularly 'complete' representation of its composer\".{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=133}} However, Copland moved from this work toward more accessible works and folk sources.\n\n=== Populist works ===\nCopland wrote ''El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico'' between 1932 and 1936, which met with a popular acclaim that contrasted the relative obscurity of most of his previous works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=302}} Inspiration for this work came from Copland's vivid recollection of visiting the \"Salon Mexico\" dancehall where he witnessed a more intimate view of Mexico's nightlife.<ref>The Story Behind my El Salon Mexico https://www.jstor.org/stable/943608</ref> Copland derived his melodic material for this piece freely from two collections of Mexican folk tunes, changing pitches and varying rhythms.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=299}} The use of a folk tune with variations set in a symphonic context started a pattern he repeated in many of his most successful works right on through the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=300}} It also marked a shift in emphasis from a unified musical structure to the rhetorical effect the music might have on an audience and showed Copland refining a simplified, more accessible musical language.{{sfn|Crist|2005|p=43}}\n\n''El Sal\u00f3n'' prepared Copland to write the ballet score ''Billy the Kid'', which became, in Pollack's words, an \"archetypical depiction of the legendary American West\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=318\u201319, 325}} Based on a Walter Noble Burns novel, with choreography by Eugene Loring, ''Billy'' was among the first to display an American music and dance vocabulary.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=315}} Copland used six cowboy folk songs to provide period atmosphere and employed [[polyrhythm]] and [[polyharmony]] when not quoting these tunes literally to maintain the work's overall tone.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=317, 320}}{{sfn|Smith|1953|p= 189}} In this way, Copland's music worked much in the same way as the murals of [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], in that it employed elements that could be grasped easily by a mass audience.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=94}} The ballet premiered in New York in 1939, with Copland recalling: \"I cannot remember another work of mine that was so unanimously received.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=323}} Along with the ballet ''Rodeo'', ''Billy the Kid'' became, in the words of musicologist Elizabeth Crist, \"the basis for Copland's reputation as a composer of Americana\" and defines \"an uncomplicated form of American nationalism\".{{sfn|Crist|2005|p=111}}\n\nCopland's brand of nationalism in his ballets differed from that of European composers such as B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, who tried to preserve the folk tones they used as close to the original as possible.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=255\u201357}} Copland enhanced the tunes he used with contemporary rhythms, textures and structures. In what could seem contradictory, he used complex harmonies and rhythms to simplify folk melodies and make them more accessible and familiar to his listeners.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=255}} Except for the Shaker tune in ''Appalachian Spring'', Copland often [[syncopation|syncopates]] traditional melodies, changes their [[metre (music)|metric patterns]] and note values.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=256}} In ''Billy the Kid'', he derives many of the work's sparse harmonies from the implied harmonic constructions of the cowboy tunes themselves.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=256}}\n\nLike Stravinsky, Copland mastered the ability to create a coherent, integrated composition from what was essentially a mosaic of divergent folk-based and original elements.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=257}} In that sense, Copland's Populist works such as ''Billy the Kid'', ''Rodeo'', ''Appalachian Spring'' are not far removed from Stravinsky's ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|pp=257\u201329}} Within that framework, however, Copland preserved the American atmosphere of these ballets through what musicologist Elliott Antokoletz calls \"the conservative handling of open diatonic sonorities\", which fosters \"a pastoral quality\" in the music.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}} This is especially true in the opening of ''Appalachian Spring'', where the harmonizations remain \"transparent and bare, suggested by the melodic disposition of the Shaker tune\".{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}} Variations which contrast to this tune in rhythm, key, texture and dynamics, fit within Copland's compositional practice of juxtaposing structural blocks.{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=263}}\n\n=== Film scores ===\nWhen Hollywood beckoned concert hall composers in the 1930s with promises of better films and higher pay, Copland saw both a challenge for his abilities as a composer as well as an opportunity to expand his reputation and audience for his more serious works.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=336}} In a departure from other film scores of the time, Copland's work largely reflected his own style, instead of the usual borrowing from the late-Romantic period.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=349}} He often avoided the full orchestra, and he rejected the common practice of using a [[leitmotiv]] to identify characters with their own personal themes. He instead matched a theme to the action, while avoiding the underlining of every action with exaggerated emphasis. Another technique Copland employed was to keep silent during intimate screen moments and only begin the music as a confirming motive toward the end of a scene.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=342}} Virgil Thomson wrote that the score for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' established \"the most distinguished populist musical style yet created in America\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=343}} Many composers who scored for western movies, particularly between 1940 and 1960, were influenced by Copland's style, though some also followed the late Romantic \"Max Steiner\" approach, which was considered more conventional and desirable.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=349}}{{sfn|Lerner|2001|p=491-99}}\n\n=== Later works ===\nCopland's work in the late 1940s and 1950s included use of Schoenberg's twelve-tone system, a development that he had recognized but not fully embraced. He had also believed the atonality of serialized music to run counter to his desire to reach a wide audience. Copland therefore approached dodecaphony with some initial skepticism.  While in Europe in 1949, he heard a number of serial works but did not admire much of it because \"so often it seemed that individuality was sacrificed to the method\".{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=151}} The music of French composer Pierre Boulez showed Copland that the technique could be separated from the \"old Wagnerian\" aesthetic with which he had associated it previously. Subsequent exposure to the late music of Austrian composer Anton Webern and twelve-tone pieces by Swiss composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] and Italian composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] strengthened this opinion.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=461}}\n\nCopland came to the conclusion that composing along serial lines was \"nothing more than an angle of vision. Like fugal treatment, it is a stimulus that enlivens musical thinking, especially when applied to a series of tones that lend themselves to that treatment.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=445\u201346}} He began his first serial work, the \"Piano Fantasy\", in 1951 to fulfill a commission from the young virtuoso pianist [[William Kapell]]. The piece became one of his most challenging works, over which he labored until 1957.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=445}} During the work's development, in 1953, Kapell died in an aircraft crash.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=481}} Critics lauded the \"Fantasy\" when it was finally premiered, calling the piece \"an outstanding addition to his own oeuvre and to contemporary piano literature\" and \"a tremendous achievement\". Jay Rosenfield stated: \"This is a new Copland to us, an artist advancing with strength and not building on the past alone.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=484\u201385}}\n\nSerialism allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices. Before he did this, according to musicologist Joseph Straus, the philosophical and compositional difference between non-tonal composers such as Schoenberg and tonal composers like Stravinsky had been considered too wide a gulf to bridge.{{sfn|Straus|2009|p=61}} Copland wrote that, to him, serialism pointed in two opposite directions, one \"toward the extreme of total organization with electronic applications\" and the other \"a gradual absorption into what had become a very ''freely interpreted tonalism'' [italics Copland]\".{{sfn|Straus|2009|pp=61\u201362}} The path he said he chose was the latter one, which he said, when he described his ''Piano Fantasy'', allowed him to incorporate \"elements able to be associated with the twelve-tone method and also with music tonally conceived\".{{sfn|Straus|2009|pp=61\u201362}} This practice differed markedly from Schoenberg, who used his tone rows as complete statements around which to structure his compositions.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=447}} Copland used his rows not much different than how he fashioned the material in his tonal pieces. He saw his rows as sources for melodies and harmonies, not as complete and independent entities, except at points in the musical structure that dictated the complete statement of a row.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=447}}\n\nEven after Copland started using 12-tone techniques, he did not stick to them exclusively but went back and forth between tonal and non-tonal compositions.{{sfn|Straus|2009|p=60}} Other late works include: ''[[Dance Panels]]'' (1959, ballet music), ''[[Something Wild (1961 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1961, his last film score, much of which would be later incorporated into his ''Music for a Great City''), ''[[Connotations (Copland)|Connotations]]'' (1962, for the new Lincoln Center Philharmonic hall), ''Emblems'' (1964, for wind band), ''[[Night-Thoughts (piano piece)|Night Thoughts]]'' (1972, for the [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]]), and ''Proclamation'' (1982, his last work, started in 1973).{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=487\u2013515}}\n\n== Critic, writer, teacher ==\nCopland did not consider himself a professional writer. He called his writing \"a byproduct of my trade\" as \"a kind of salesman for contemporary music\".{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=175}} As such, he wrote prolifically about music, including pieces on music criticism analysis, on musical trends, and on his own compositions.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=265}} An avid lecturer and lecturer-performer, Copland eventually collected his presentation notes into three books, ''What to Listen for in Music'' (1939), ''Our New Music'' (1941), and ''Music and Imagination'' (1952).{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=264}} In the 1980s, he collaborated with Vivian Perlis on a two-volume autobiography, ''Copland: 1900 Through 1942'' (1984) and ''Copland Since 1943'' (1989). Along with the composer's first-person narrative, these two books incorporate 11 \"interludes\" by Perlis and other sections from friends and peers.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}} Some controversy arose over the second volume's increased reliance over the first on old documents for source material. Due to the then-advanced stage of Copland's Alzheimer's and the resulting memory loss, however, this fallback to previous material was inevitable.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}} The use in both books of letters and other unpublished sources, expertly researched and organized, made them what Pollack terms \"invaluable\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=545}}\n\nDuring his career, Copland met and helped hundreds of young composers, whom he met and who were drawn to him by his continual interest and acuity into the contemporary musical scene.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=178\u201379}}{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=285}} This assistance came mainly outside an institutional framework\u2014other than his summers at the [[Berkshire Music Center]] at Tanglewood and a few semesters at Harvard and the State University of New York at Buffalo, Copland operated outside an academic setting.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=179}} Pollack writes: \"Those composers who actually studied with him were small in number and did so for only brief periods; rather, Copland helped younger composers more informally, with intermittent advice and aid.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=179}} This advice included focusing on expressive content rather than on purely technical points and on developing a personal style.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=290}}{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=194}}\n\nCopland's willingness to foster talent extended to critiquing scores in progress that were presented to him by his peers. Composer [[William Schuman]] writes: \"As a teacher, Aaron was extraordinary.... Copland would look at your music and try to understand what ''you'' were after [italics Schuman]. He didn't want to turn you into another Aaron Copland.... When he questioned something, it was in a manner that might make you want to question it yourself. Everything he said was helpful in making a younger composer realize the potential of a particular work. On the other hand, Aaron could be strongly critical.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=191\u201392}}\n\n== Conductor ==\nAlthough Copland studied conducting in Paris in 1921, he remained essentially a self-taught conductor with a very personal style.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=532}} Encouraged by Igor Stravinsky to master conducting and perhaps emboldened by Carlos Chavez's efforts in Mexico, he began to direct his own works on his international travels in the 1940s.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=533}} By the 1950s, he was also conducting the works of other composers, and after a televised appearance where he directed the New York Philharmonic, Copland became in high demand.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=534}} He placed a strong emphasis in his programs on [[20th-century music]] and lesser-known composers, and until the 1970s rarely planned concerts to feature his music exclusively.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=535\u201336}} Performers and audiences generally greeted his conducting appearances as positive opportunities to hear his music as the composer intended. His efforts on behalf of other composers could be penetrating but also uneven.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=538\u201339}}\n\nUnderstated on the podium, Copland modeled his style after other composer/conductors such as Stravinsky and [[Paul Hindemith]].{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=536}} Critics wrote of his precision and clarity before an orchestra.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=536}} Observers noted that he had \"none of the typical conductorial vanities\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=537}} Copland's unpretentious charm was appreciated by professional musicians but some criticized his \"unsteady\" beat and \"unexciting\" interpretations.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=537\u201338}} Koussevitzky advised him to \"stay home and compose\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=533\u201334}} Copland at times asked for conducting advice from Bernstein, who occasionally joked that Copland could conduct his works \"a little better.\" Bernstein also noted that Copland improved over time, and he considered him a more natural conductor than Stravinsky or Hindemith.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|pp=533, 538}}{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=172}} Eventually, Copland recorded nearly all his orchestral works with himself conducting.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=535}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nCopland wrote a total of about 100 works which covered a diverse range of genres. Many of these compositions, especially orchestral pieces, have remained part of the standard American repertoire.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=555}} According to Pollack, Copland \"had perhaps the most distinctive and identifiable musical voice produced by this country so far, an individuality ... that helped define for many what American concert music sounds like at its most characteristic and that exerted enormous influence on multitudes of contemporaries and successors.\"{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=555}}  His synthesis of influences and inclinations helped create the \"Americanism\" of his music.{{sfn|Smith|1953|pp=292\u201394}} The composer himself pointed out, in summarizing the American character of his music, \"the optimistic tone\", \"his love of rather large canvases\", \"a certain directness in expression of sentiment\", and \"a certain songfulness\".{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=530}}\n\nWhile \"Copland's musical rhetoric has become iconic\" and \"has functioned as a mirror of America,\" conductor [[Leon Botstein]] suggests that the composer \"helped define the modern consciousness of America's ideals, character and sense of place. The notion that his music played not a subsidiary but a central role in the shaping of the national consciousness makes Copland uniquely interesting, for the historian as well as the musician.\"{{sfn|Oja|Tick|2005|p=442}} Composer [[Ned Rorem]] states, \"Aaron stressed simplicity: Remove, remove, remove what isn't needed.... Aaron brought leanness to America, which set the tone for our musical language throughout [World War II]. Thanks to Aaron, American music came into its own.\"{{sfn|Copland|Perlis|1984|p=124}}\n\n== Awards ==\n* On September 14, 1964, Aaron Copland was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Lyndon Johnson]].\n* In honor of Copland's vast influence on American music, on December 15, 1970, he was awarded the prestigious [[University of Pennsylvania Glee Club]] Award of Merit.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/gleeclub/awards.shtml |title = The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit Recipients}}</ref> Beginning in 1964, this award \"established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression\".\n* Copland was awarded the New York Music Critics' Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize in composition for ''Appalachian Spring''.{{sfn|Pollack|1999|p=404}} His scores for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), ''Our Town'' (1940), and ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'' (1943) all received Academy Award nominations, while ''[[The Heiress]]'' won Best Music in 1950.{{sfn|Smith|1953|p=201}}\n*In 1961, Aaron Copland was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal by the MacDowell Colony. \n* He was a recipient of [[Yale University]]'s [[Sanford Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/6384-Leading-clarinetist-to-receive-Sanford-Medal |title=Leading clarinetist to receive Sanford Medal |date=31 August 2005 |work=Tourdates.Co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729125854/http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/6384-leading-clarinetist-to-receive-sanford-medal |archivedate=July 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* In 1986, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].\n* He was awarded a special [[Congressional Gold Medal]] by the [[United States Congress]] in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/goldMedal.html |title=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives Congressional Gold Medal Recipients |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |accessdate=May 14, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511101420/http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/goldMedal.html| archivedate=May 11, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n* He was made an honorary member of the Alpha Upsilon chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] in 1961 and was awarded the fraternity's [[Charles E.
