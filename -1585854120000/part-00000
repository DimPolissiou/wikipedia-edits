David originally appeared from 23 December 1993 to 21 November 1996. He returned to the show on 1 January 2012 and departed two weeks later. French returned to the role in September 2013. David has been involved in various storylines, such as his troubled and dysfunctional reconciliation with his biological children [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and [[Joe Wicks]] ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]), \u2014his volatile and equally dysfunctional relationship with his mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), an affair with his half-sister-in-law [[Cindy Beale]], reuniting with [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) and struggling to cope with her diagnosis of [[breast cancer]]. On 17 May 2014, it was announced that French had once again decided to leave the show. David last appeared on 30 May 2014, after his relationship with Carol broke down.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a571701/eastenders-michael-french-leaving-david-wicks-role.html |title=EastEnders exit for David Wicks confirmed |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=17 May 2014 |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |accessdate=17 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===Backstory===\nDavid is the son of [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and her first husband [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]). Pat and Pete split up when David and his brother [[Simon Wicks|Simon]] ([[Nick Berry]]) were young and Pat remarried to [[Brian Wicks (EastEnders)|Brian Wicks]] ([[Leslie Schofield]]), who adopted both David and Simon (who turned out to be Brian's biological son). Meanwhile, Pete remarried to [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Hills]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and had another son, [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Pete had no further contact with David and Simon when they moved away from Walford in 1976.\n\nDuring his teenage years David got his girlfriend [[Carol Jackson|Carol Branning]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) pregnant at the age of 14. David and the rest of the Branning family tried to persuade Carol to have an abortion and Carol's brother [[Derek Branning]] ([[Terence Beesley]], later [[Jamie Foreman]]) severely beat David up. The Wicks family left Walford, due to Derek's aggression so David never knew if Carol had the abortion or not. For the next few years, David, his mother and brother, suffered at the violent hands of his abusive stepfather, Brian. Pat also proved to be a negligent mother due to her [[alcoholism]] and constant [[promiscuity]]. In 1979, the 17-year-old David moved to live with his girlfriend, [[Lorraine Wicks|Lorraine Foster]] ([[Jacqueline Leonard]]), and she quickly becomes pregnant. They married in a quick wedding ceremony before the birth of their son [[Joe Wicks|Joe]] ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]) in 1980 when David was 18. This was followed by a daughter, Karen, in 1982. David was a restless man feeling tied down and after several affairs he left his wife and children in 1988.\n\n===1993\u20131996===\n[[File:David Wicks.jpg|200px|thumb|David Wicks as he appeared in 1995.]]\nDavid returns to Albert Square on 23 December 1993 for the funeral of his father Pete, who had died in a car crash two weeks earlier. A few weeks later he moves in with his mother Pat and soon goes into business with her stepson [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) with a car lot that they name \"Deals on Wheels\". David receives a stark reminder of his past in the form of Carol and her large brood of children, who have just moved into Albert Square, and soon finds himself falling for her oldest daughter [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). Carol is very hostile towards him, and is horrified when she witnesses the growing flirtatious relationship between David and Bianca. This results in Carol telling David that Bianca is his daughter in March 1994. David is horrified and agrees to keep his distance from Bianca, much to her chagrin.\n\nThe truth is revealed to an embarrassed Bianca in March 1995 when, after drunkenly trying to kiss David after he rescues her from being mugged, David is forced to confess that she is his daughter. Despite being initially hostile towards David over his absence during the majority of her life, Bianca has a change of heart and is keen to bond with her father. But the relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995, David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of [[Genetic Sexual Attraction|GSA]], this was one of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by dating his stepbrother Ricky. Though David's unexplained strange behaviour towards Bianca is never fully explained to an unaware and confused Bianca, they eventually form a close bond naturally as a father and daughter. David's estranged son Joe arrives in Walford in April 1996. With him comes the news that his daughter Karen died in a car accident nine months previously. Joe's return causes many problems for David, and at first David rejects the idea of having his son back in his life. However, after Joe runs away and arrives back at David's again, he becomes more receptive to Joe and the idea of having him in his life again. Eventually Joe and Lorraine move down to London from Bolton and Joe moves in with David. However, Joe seriously blames himself for Karen's death, and this leads to Joe developing [[schizophrenia]]. Joe exhibits increasingly strange behaviour that gets progressively worse. This is one of the main reasons that David eventually leaves [[Walford]].\n\nDavid is a notorious womaniser. He has relations with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]) and an affair with [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), the wife of his half-brother Ian. Cindy becomes obsessed with the idea of running off with David, and hires a hit man to kill Ian. Ian is shot but survives, and when David finds out he ends the relationship, but not before helping Cindy escape with her two sons. Shortly after, David has a fling with ex-partner, Carol. Eventually, the truth is revealed about David's affair with Cindy and his fore-knowledge of the attempted murder of Ian. The loss of friends and alienation of his family, together with Joe's worsening mental condition with schizophrenia leads David to decide leave Albert Square for [[Milan]]. David leaves in a torrent of tears after telling Joe he is going.\n\n===2012&ndash;2014===\nIn 2010, Bianca receives \u00a310,000 for her wedding from David, as he is unable to attend. In December 2011, Pat phones David after she learns that he has had an affair with his brother Simon's wife. Pat argues with David on the phone about his infidelity, and ends the call on bad terms.\n\nDavid returns the following month after hearing that Pat is ill. He is later stunned to discover that Pat is in fact dying of [[pancreatic cancer]]. They argue and David resolves to leave, but Carol persuades him to stay. Derek arrives and provokes David, and a fight breaks out. David tells Derek he is staying and returns to Pat, where he forgives her for her past mistakes and she dies in his arms. David decides to stay in Walford to plan Pat's funeral. He flirts with [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) and goes to have sex with her, but has second thoughts and nothing happens. David then declares his love for Carol. She reciprocates, and the pair reunite. David tries to settle his differences with Derek, but Derek threatens him. [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) suggests to David that they should team up to bring Derek down and get him arrested. David agrees after Derek upsets Carol. They attempt to set Derek up by having Michael plant stolen goods in Derek's home. However, Derek catches Michael in the act, and Michael blames the entire scheme on David. When David learns of this he begs Carol to leave with him. Carol agrees, but after Pat's funeral, David is confronted by Derek and his brothers [[Jack Branning|Jack]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]). Derek threatens to kill David, but Jack and Max restrain Derek as they let David go. As he returns to his car to meet Carol, he sees her saying an emotional goodbye to Bianca and her family, so realises her family needs her and leaves without her. David sends a letter to Carol but it is intercepted and locked away by Derek. After Derek dies, the letter is found and Carol tries to contact David but discovers his phone number has been disconnected.\n\nSeveral months later, David unexpectedly arrives at Carol's house, interrupting her evening with her boyfriend, [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]), saying he has a present for Bianca. His girlfriend [[List of EastEnders characters (2013)#Naomi|Naomi]] ([[Lisa Maxwell (actress)|Lisa Maxwell]]) arrives with a suitcase of cash that they stole from her husband [[List of EastEnders characters (2013)#Don|Don]] (Simon Thorp). Naomi realises that David wants to give some of the cash to Bianca, and when he says they are just using each other, she calls Don, who arrives and beats David up. Carol takes him in, which bothers Masood. When he recovers, he agrees to leave but manipulates Carol into letting him stay until Bianca returns. He attempts to meddle in Masood and Carol's relationship because he wants Carol back. When Bianca returns, she is overjoyed to see David, but asks him to leave for Carol's sake. However, she changes her mind when she decides she wants her father around. David realises that Max is in prison because he was set up by [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) and that Ian is probably lying about being a witness. When David cannot convince Ian to retract his statement, he tells [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) what he knows, who kidnaps Ian so that Max is set free and Carol has her brother back. In gratitude, Max offers David a job at the car lot. David and Carol drift apart and she asks him to leave the family home. After Alice's brother [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]) tips him off, David becomes suspicious that his former stepsister [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) killed Michael and has framed [[Alice Branning]] ([[Jasmyn Banks]]). He manipulates Janine into letting him move in and then into confessing the murder. He records the confession on his phone and blackmails Janine into giving him \u00a3250,000 or he will reveal the truth.\n\nWhen Carol starts to act erratically, David asks her what the matter is. She brings him along to a doctor's appointment where he discovered she has [[breast cancer]]. Carol later invites David to move back in with him. Janine panics that she may go to prison and decides to kill David by running him over with a car, but he suffers only minor injuries. He takes Janine to her house and takes the \u00a3250,000, but agrees to wait a day before calling the police, so that Janine can have a chance to be a mother to her daughter [[Scarlett Moon]], while still ensuring Alice's release from prison. He also blurts out about Carol's cancer to Janine, saying that he wants the money to pay for her care. David returns to Carol's house, where she reveals she found his phone and has heard Janine's confession. He asks for his phone back, but she tells him that she's handed it to Joey. When he goes to stop Joey, he sees Janine being arrested. David asks Max, who rents the car lot building, if he can have a 50% control of the business, and offers him \u00a350,000 to do it up. When Max refuses, David tells him about Carol's illness and he decides to accept the offer. However, Max is furious when he finds the porter cabin that he uses being taken away. About an hour later, a bigger porter cabin arrives with a new name, titled ''Deals On Wheels''. David later buys the building from Roxy, for \u00a3100,000, leaving him in full control of the business. However, he promises Carol that he will continue to treat Max properly. In February 2014, Carol dumps Masood, after realising that she still loves David, and the couple get engaged the following month. In the build-up to the wedding, David is tempted by [[Nikki Spraggan]] (Rachel Wilde), and kisses her on one occasion, though he regrets this and rejects her on several other occasions. When Bianca discovers this, David reaffirms his love for Carol. On the day of the wedding, David suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and collapses in the middle of the Square, leading Carol to believe that he has jilted her again. He is taken into hospital, where Carol eventually realises he is, and visits him. However, they argue, as Carol believes that he isn't as ill as he is making out. Carol leaves the hospital.  David discharges himself the next day, and visits Carol at home. Despite their attempts to save their relationship, both concede that they cannot work.

David originally appeared from 23 December 1993 to 21 November 1996. He returned to the show on 1 January 2012 and departed two weeks later. French returned to the role in September 2013. David has been involved in various storylines, such as his troubled and dysfunctional reconciliation with his biological children [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and [[Joe Wicks]] ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]), \u2014his volatile and equally dysfunctional relationship with his mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), an affair with his half-sister-in-law [[Cindy Beale]], reuniting with [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) and struggling to cope with her diagnosis of [[breast cancer]]. On 17 May 2014, it was announced that French had once again decided to leave the show. David last appeared on 30 May 2014, after his relationship with Carol broke down.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a571701/eastenders-michael-french-leaving-david-wicks-role.html |title=EastEnders exit for David Wicks confirmed |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=17 May 2014 |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |accessdate=17 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===Backstory===\nDavid is the son of [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) and her first husband [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]). Pat and Pete split up when David and his brother [[Simon Wicks|Simon]] ([[Nick Berry]]) were young and Pat remarried to [[Brian Wicks (EastEnders)|Brian Wicks]] ([[Leslie Schofield]]), who adopted both David and Simon (who turned out to be Brian's biological son). Meanwhile, Pete remarried to [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Hills]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and had another son, [[Ian Beale|Ian]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Pete had no further contact with David and Simon when they moved away from Walford in 1976.\n\nDuring his teenage years David got his girlfriend [[Carol Jackson|Carol Branning]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) pregnant at the age of 14. David and the rest of the Branning family tried to persuade Carol to have an abortion and Carol's brother [[Derek Branning]] ([[Terence Beesley]], later [[Jamie Foreman]]) severely beat David up. The Wicks family left Walford, due to Derek's aggression so David never knew if Carol had the abortion or not. For the next few years, David, his mother and brother, suffered at the violent hands of his abusive stepfather, Brian. Pat also proved to be a negligent mother due to her [[alcoholism]] and constant [[promiscuity]]. In 1979, the 17-year-old David moved to live with his girlfriend, [[Lorraine Wicks|Lorraine Foster]] ([[Jacqueline Leonard]]), and she quickly becomes pregnant. They married in a quick wedding ceremony before the birth of their son [[Joe Wicks|Joe]] ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]) in 1980 when David was 18. This was followed by a daughter, Karen, in 1982. David was a restless man feeling tied down and after several affairs he left his wife and children in 1988.\n\n===1993\u20131996===\n[[File:David Wicks.jpg|200px|thumb|David Wicks as he appeared in 1995.]]\nDavid returns to Albert Square on 23 December 1993 for the funeral of his father Pete, who had died in a car crash two weeks earlier. A few weeks later he moves in with his mother Pat and soon goes into business with her stepson [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) with a car lot that they name \"Deals on Wheels\". David receives a stark reminder of his past in the form of Carol and her large brood of children, who have just moved into Albert Square, and soon finds himself falling for her oldest daughter [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). Carol is very hostile towards him, and is horrified when she witnesses the growing flirtatious relationship between David and Bianca. This results in Carol telling David that Bianca is his daughter in March 1994. David is horrified and agrees to keep his distance from Bianca, much to her chagrin.\n\nThe truth is revealed to an embarrassed Bianca in March 1995 when, after drunkenly trying to kiss David after he rescues her from being mugged, David is forced to confess that she is his daughter. Despite being initially hostile towards David over his absence during the majority of her life, Bianca has a change of heart and is keen to bond with her father. But the relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995, David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of [[Genetic Sexual Attraction|GSA]], this was one of ''EastEnders''{{'}} most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by dating his stepbrother Ricky. Though David's unexplained strange behaviour towards Bianca is never fully explained to an unaware and confused Bianca, they eventually form a close bond naturally as a father and daughter. David's estranged son Joe arrives in Walford in April 1996. With him comes the news that his daughter Karen died in a car accident nine months previously. Joe's return causes many problems for David, and at first David rejects the idea of having his son back in his life. However, after Joe runs away and arrives back at David's again, he becomes more receptive to Joe and the idea of having him in his life again. Eventually Joe and Lorraine move down to London from Bolton and Joe moves in with David. However, Joe seriously blames himself for Karen's death, and this leads to Joe developing [[schizophrenia]]. Joe exhibits increasingly strange behaviour that gets progressively worse. This is one of the main reasons that David eventually leaves [[Walford]].\n\nDavid is a notorious womaniser. He has relations with [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]) and an affair with [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), the wife of his half-brother Ian. Cindy becomes obsessed with the idea of running off with David, and hires a hit man to kill Ian. Ian is shot but survives, and when David finds out he ends the relationship, but not before helping Cindy escape with her two sons. Shortly after, David has a fling with ex-partner, Carol. Eventually, the truth is revealed about David's affair with Cindy and his fore-knowledge of the attempted murder of Ian. The loss of friends and alienation of his family, together with Joe's worsening mental condition with schizophrenia leads David to decide leave Albert Square for [[Milan]]. David leaves in a torrent of tears after telling Joe he is going.\n\n===2012&ndash;2014===\nIn 2010, Bianca receives \u00a310,000 for her wedding from David, as he is unable to attend. In December 2011, Pat phones David after she learns that he has had an affair with his brother Simon's wife. Pat argues with David on the phone about his infidelity, and ends the call on bad terms.\n\nDavid returns the following month after hearing that Pat is ill. He is later stunned to discover that Pat is in fact dying of [[pancreatic cancer]]. They argue and David resolves to leave, but Carol persuades him to stay. Derek arrives and provokes David, and a fight breaks out. David tells Derek he is staying and returns to Pat, where he forgives her for her past mistakes and she dies in his arms. David decides to stay in Walford to plan Pat's funeral. He flirts with [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) and goes to have sex with her, but has second thoughts and nothing happens. David then declares his love for Carol. She reciprocates, and the pair reunite. David tries to settle his differences with Derek, but Derek threatens him. [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) suggests to David that they should team up to bring Derek down and get him arrested. David agrees after Derek upsets Carol. They attempt to set Derek up by having Michael plant stolen goods in Derek's home. However, Derek catches Michael in the act, and Michael blames the entire scheme on David. When David learns of this he begs Carol to leave with him. Carol agrees, but after Pat's funeral, David is confronted by Derek and his brothers [[Jack Branning|Jack]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]). Derek threatens to kill David, but Jack and Max restrain Derek as they let David go. As he returns to his car to meet Carol, he sees her saying an emotional goodbye to Bianca and her family, so realises her family needs her and leaves without her. David sends a letter to Carol but it is intercepted and locked away by Derek. After Derek dies, the letter is found and Carol tries to contact David but discovers his phone number has been disconnected.\n\nSeveral months later, David unexpectedly arrives at Carol's house, interrupting her evening with her boyfriend, [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]), saying he has a present for Bianca. His girlfriend [[List of EastEnders characters (2013)#Naomi|Naomi]] ([[Lisa Maxwell (actress)|Lisa Maxwell]]) arrives with a suitcase of cash that they stole from her husband [[List of EastEnders characters (2013)#Don|Don]] (Simon Thorp). Naomi realises that David wants to give some of the cash to Bianca, and when he says they are just using each other, she calls Don, who arrives and beats David up. Carol takes him in, which bothers Masood. When he recovers, he agrees to leave but manipulates Carol into letting him stay until Bianca returns. He attempts to meddle in Masood and Carol's relationship because he wants Carol back. When Bianca returns, she is overjoyed to see David, but asks him to leave for Carol's sake. However, she changes her mind when she decides she wants her father around. David realises that Max is in prison because he was set up by [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) and that Ian is probably lying about being a witness. When David cannot convince Ian to retract his statement, he tells [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) what he knows, who kidnaps Ian so that Max is set free and Carol has her brother back. In gratitude, Max offers David a job at the car lot. David and Carol drift apart and she asks him to leave the family home. After Alice's brother [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]) tips him off, David becomes suspicious that his former stepsister [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) killed Michael and has framed [[Alice Branning]] ([[Jasmyn Banks]]). He manipulates Janine into letting him move in and then into confessing the murder. He records the confession on his phone and blackmails Janine into giving him \u00a3250,000 or he will reveal the truth.\n\nWhen Carol starts to act erratically, David asks her what the matter is. She brings him along to a doctor's appointment where he discovered she has [[breast cancer]]. Carol later invites David to move back in with him. Janine panics that she may go to prison and decides to kill David by running him over with a car, but he suffers only minor injuries. He takes Janine to her house and takes the \u00a3250,000, but agrees to wait a day before calling the police, so that Janine can have a chance to be a mother to her daughter [[Scarlett Moon]], while still ensuring Alice's release from prison. He also blurts out about Carol's cancer to Janine, saying that he wants the money to pay for her care. David returns to Carol's house, where she reveals she found his phone and has heard Janine's confession. He asks for his phone back, but she tells him that she's handed it to Joey. When he goes to stop Joey, he sees Janine being arrested. David asks Max, who rents the car lot building, if he can have a 50% control of the business, and offers him \u00a350,000 to do it up. When Max refuses, David tells him about Carol's illness and he decides to accept the offer. However, Max is furious when he finds the porter cabin that he uses being taken away. About an hour later, a bigger porter cabin arrives with a new name, titled ''Deals On Wheels''. David later buys the building from Roxy, for \u00a3100,000, leaving him in full control of the business. However, he promises Carol that he will continue to treat Max properly. In February 2014, Carol dumps Masood, after realising that she still loves David, and the couple get engaged the following month. In the build-up to the wedding, David is tempted by [[Nikki Spraggan]] (Rachel Wilde), and kisses her on one occasion, though he regrets this and rejects her on several other occasions. When Bianca discovers this, David reaffirms his love for Carol. On the day of the wedding, David suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and collapses in the middle of the Square, leading Carol to believe that he has jilted her again. He is taken into hospital, where Carol eventually realises he is, and visits him. However, they argue, as Carol believes that he isn't as ill as he is making out. Carol leaves the hospital.  David discharges himself the next day, and visits Carol at home. Despite their attempts to save their relationship, both concede that they cannot work. After sharing one last dance together, David agrees to move out and also to return to hospital. However, he changes his mind at the last minute and asks his driver to take him to Heathrow Airport alone. It is later revealed that David is living in the [[United States]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Departure===\nIt was announced in February 1996 that French and [[Michelle Collins]] had decided to quit their roles of David and Cindy in order to pursue other roles.<ref name=\"1996 Departure\">{{cite web|last=Sayid|first=Ruki|title=SIZZLING CINDY TO QUIT EASTENDERS|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SIZZLING+CINDY+TO+QUIT+EASTENDERS.-a061157398|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=11 February 1996}}</ref> An ''EastEnders'' insider said that Cindy is desperate for David to leave the Square with her and the children and is said to \"rock the square\".<ref name=\"1996 Departure\" /> Producers were reportedly trying to keep French with the show but only managed to persuade him to stay for another few months.<ref>{{cite web|title=French leaves in the autumn|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/French+leaves+in+the+autumn.-a061155762|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=7 April 1996}}</ref> French was rumoured to have \"cracked up\" when filming his final scenes as David.<ref name=\"Final Scenes\">{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Victoria|title=I CAN'T GO ON' ANGUISH OF EASTENDER STAR FRENCH|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60I+CAN'T+GO+ON'+ANGUISH+OF+EASTENDER+STAR+FRENCH.-a061155604|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=22 September 1996}}</ref> He broke down during filming and said to the cast: \"I can't go on\".<ref name=\"Final Scenes\" /> An insider said that French repeatedly kept getting one line wrong and later stormed off set and refused to continue until crew members were able to calm him down.<ref name=\"Final Scenes\" />\n\n===Reintroduction===\nOn 7 July 2011, it was announced that St. Clement had quit ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"SkyNews\">{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/x/Article/201107116026407|title=Pat set to hang up earrings|date=7 July 2011|work=[[Sky News]]|publisher=[[BSkyB]]|accessdate=7 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062659/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/x/Article/201107116026407|archivedate=11 July 2011|df=}}</ref> In October 2011, it was rumoured that David and Simon were to return to ''EastEnders'' for Pat's departure storyline.<ref name=\"Tipped\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a339910/eastenders-simon-and-david-wicks-tipped-for-return.html|title='EastEnders' Simon and David Wicks tipped for return|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|date=12 September 2011|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|accessdate=13 November 2011|location=[[London]]}}</ref> ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported producers were working to get French and Berry on board.<ref name=\"Tipped\"/> A BBC spokesperson declined to comment on the report, saying \"There has been a lot of speculation surrounding Pat's departure, however we are not going to comment on rumours at this stage as we don't want to spoil the storyline for viewers.\"<ref name=\"Tipped\"/> On 13 November 2011, it was confirmed French would be reprising his role as David after an absence of 15 years.\n<ref name=\"Daniels\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a350609/eastenders-david-wicks-returns-for-pats-funeral.html|title='EastEnders' David Wicks returns for Pat's funeral|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|date=13 November 2011|first=Colin|last=Daniels|accessdate=13 November 2011|location=[[London]]}}</ref> French returned to ''EastEnders'' as David Wicks in 2012 after more than 15 years away for the departure of [[Pam St Clement]], who played his on-screen mother, [[Pat Butcher]].
