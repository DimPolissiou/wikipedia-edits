Its [[hiking]] trails offer views of the river, rolling glacial [[moraine]], and bluffland it preserves. It is a popular place for [[birdwatching]], [[picnic]]s, [[camping]], and other typical outdoor recreational activities. To deter overuse of a state park only {{convert|20|mi|km}} from downtown [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], there is no vehicle access to the camping area or swimming beach.\n\nThe park is located approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=in}} south of the town of [[Afton, Minnesota]]. The park surrounds the unaffiliated [[Afton Alps]] ski area on three sides. The name \"Afton\" was given to this area by its settlers as a reference to the [[Robert Burns]] poem \"Afton Water\", which is about the [[River Afton]] in Scotland.\n\n==Natural history==\nThe park lies on a glacial [[moraine]], scribed with deep [[ravine]]s running down to the St. Croix River. [[Sandstone]] outcrops have been exposed in some of the ravines. The vertical drop from the blufftop to the water is {{convert|300|ft|m}}.\n\nA few patches of remnant [[prairie]] survived the decades of farming that took place on the blufftop. Today the former fields are being restored to prairie and [[oak savanna]]. The ravines leading down to the riverbank are thickly wooded with [[oak]], [[aspen]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]].\n\n==Cultural history==\nWith [[William O'Brien State Park]] growing increasingly crowded in the 1960s, Minnesota was on the lookout for more recreational land near [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]]. Very little state park-caliber land remained, especially along the scenic and well-settled St. Croix River. Therefore, it was a surprise when an undeveloped property directly on the river, containing the last beach on the Minnesota side, went on the market in 1967. Although some of the blufftop had been farmed, the steep ravines had deterred most other development. State park officials and advocacy groups acted quickly and purchased the property the next summer. Many local residents opposed the new state park, fearing the onslaught of visitors it would attract. Resistance continued after the park was authorized by [[legislation]] in 1969, and acquisition of property to fill out the park dragged on for thirteen years. Residents did achieve a few key compromises. The park entrance was moved from the north to the west side, [[snowmobile]]s were banned, and the road was shortened from its original plan. Thus the camping area and beach are only accessible by hiking. Afton State Park finally opened to the public in 1982, with the visitor center only being completed the following year.<ref name=\"Meyer\">{{Cite book |last=Meyer |first=Roy W. |title=Everyone's Country Estate: A History of Minnesota's State Parks |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-87351-266-9 |location=St. Paul, Minn.}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2011 Minnesota state government shutdown]], all state parks were closed, leaving Afton open to a serious vandalism and burglary of three park buildings.  A group of a dozen young men drove around the gate into the park, where they ransacked an administrative building and vandalized two camper cabins.

From an early age she had a keen interest in agriculture, and worked alongside the Africans, Afrikaans, British and Sikhs employed on the mixed farms. With her mother, Patricia Wright, guiding her, she learnt the correct botanical structure and petal colour of innumerable flowers grown commercially for seed, whilst also participating in the cultivation of coffee, seed beans and aromatic plants destined for the perfume trade. Cook's family members were committed [[environmentalist]]s long before the term became a household word. Living with her parents and widely-travelled grandparents in the same house, Cook was exposed to Australian, European, Asian (particularly Japanese) and African cultural influences. This exposure almost certainly contributed to the development of her passion for nature, travelling and all forms of art. The long fascinated hours she spent in the [[darkroom]] with her photographer grandfather led to the genesis of her love of monochromatic photographs and drawings. In addition to these influences, she learned much of local and British politics as both her grandfather, Francis James Anderson, and father, Jack Wright, were very active politically.\n\nCook finished her high school education at Limuru High School, outside Nairobi, Kenya, at the same time that the then Tanganyika (later Tanzania) became independent. She continued her studies in languages and business in London and Paris, then worked in an international organization, [[European Launcher Development Organisation]] (precursor to the [[European Space Agency]]), before taking another degree at [http://www.efap.com EFAP], the French communications school.

Highly conscious of metalpoint\u2019s illustrious heritage, Cook draws mostly in silver, always from real life, and does not lay out any preparatory indications on the drawing surface before starting her drawing in metal. She believes that working directly from life confers spontaneity to a drawing, making it possible for intuition to guide the drawing and allowing the subject matter to dictate. For Cook, this method of drawing allows for unexpected results and opportunities to grow as an artist.\n[[File:Miro's Pine Tree 1, by Jeannine Cook.jpg|left|thumb|160x160px|Miro's Pine Tree 1, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook]]\nRigorous in her choice of archival-quality materials, Cook most often prepares her smooth drawing supports in advance with acrylic-based grounds, particularly if she is drawing outdoors in hot and insect-filled environments. Working on paper, board, and occasionally porcelain, the artist lets the silver and copper drawings tarnish naturally.\n[[File:Summer Energy - Tillandsia recurvata, silverpoint, watercolour, Jeannine Cook.jpg|thumb|272x272px|Summer Energy - ''Tillandsia recurvata'', silverpoint, watercolour, Jeannine Cook]]\nLike other contemporary metalpoint artists,<ref name=\"Silverpoint\" /> Cook experiments with the medium, exploring innovative ways to extend its unique properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britishmuseum.tumblr.com/post/133586998942/metalpoint-still-resonates-with-artists|title=Metalpoint still resonates with artists|website=britishmuseum.tumblr.com|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> She frequently combines touches of colour with the monochromatic drawings, employing such media as [[Prismacolor|Prismacolour]], [https://www.fabercastell.com/collections/art-graphic/polychromos-color-pencils Polychromos pencil], watercolour, [https://www.neenahpaper.com/brands/plike-papers Plike paper], [https://japanobjects.com/features/washi-paper Washi papers], silk fabric and silk threads, whilst at other times she uses coloured grounds or coloured supports, such as in the drawing ''Tillandsia recurvata''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bullock|first1=Robert Edward|title=Beautiful Tarnished Lines|url=http://bullockonlinereviews.blogspot.fr/2013/12/|website=Bullock Online Reviews|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref> Her artistic vocabulary also includes gold and silver foil and marks made with wide metal tools (spoons, rings or bracelets, wedges of silver, etc.).

Deeply passionate about environmental issues, Cook reminds us to wake up, to look, to truly see nature. Her art acts as an advocate for a more informed look at our planet, at details that reveal nature's past and present: hurricane-struck red cedar trees that become burnished silver skeletons, tree barks that bespeak age and endurance, stones that tell of past geological dramas. Given that the majority of the world\u2019s population is now urban, Cook sees the need to share with art lovers the intricacy, elegance and vital importance of even the smallest aspect of life in the natural world. The rarity and allure of the lustrous metalpoint medium arouse curiosity and offer a starting point for dialogue about much wider environmental issues and the rewards that await us when we awaken to nature\u2019s riches.<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Remembering (Catteleya), graphite, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Remembering (Catteleya), graphite, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Palmetto Frond .jpg|Palmetto Frond, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Stone Lace I, silverpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Stone Lace I, silverpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Stone Lace II, by Jeannine Cook.jpg|Stone Lace II, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Japanese Maple Bark, silverpoint, copperpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Japanese Maple Bark, silverpoint, copperpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook\n</gallery>\n\n===Exhibitions===\n[[File:Pensando en Miro 1, by Jeannine Cook.jpg|thumb|Pensando en Mir\u00f3 1, silverpoint, Plike paper, Jeannine Cook|alt=|150x150px]]\nCook's metalpoint drawings have been shown in solo exhibitions in over a dozen museums and galleries in the past ten years, while she has also participated in more than twenty-two juried or invitational metalpoint gallery and museum group shows since 2010 in the United States and Europe.

Her work is now represented in such museums as the [[British Museum]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria & Albert Museum]], and [https://bampfa.org BAMPFA], in Berkeley, California, among many others around the world.<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Fallen Palmetto, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Fallen Palmetto, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Limestone Lace, silverpoint, goldpoint, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Limestone Lace, silverpoint, goldpoint, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Miro's Pine Tree 2, by Jeannine Cook.jpg|Mir\u00f3's Pine Tree 2, silverpoint, Plike paper, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Pierres de Chablis, silverpoint silver foil, watercolour, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Pierres de Chablis, silverpoint, silver leaf, watercolour, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Cork Oak Contours, goldpoint, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Cork Oak Contours, goldpoint, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook\n</gallery>\n\n== Life ==\n\nCook was born in [[Kenya]], and grew up on her family\u2019s farm in the Northern Province of [[Tanzania]], near [[Arusha]]. From an early age she had a keen interest in agriculture, and worked alongside the Africans, Afrikaans, British and Sikhs employed on the mixed farms. With her mother, Patricia Wright, guiding her, she learnt the correct botanical structure and petal colour of innumerable flowers grown commercially for seed, whilst also participating in the cultivation of coffee, seed beans and aromatic plants destined for the perfume trade. Cook's family members were committed [[environmentalist]]s long before the term became a household word. Living with her parents and widely-travelled grandparents in the same house, Cook was exposed to Australian, European, Asian (particularly Japanese) and African cultural influences. This exposure almost certainly contributed to the development of her passion for nature, travelling and all forms of art. The long fascinated hours she spent in the [[darkroom]] with her photographer grandfather led to the genesis of her love of monochromatic photographs and drawings. In addition to these influences, she learned much of local and British politics as both her grandfather, Francis James Anderson, and father, Jack Wright, were very active politically.\n\nCook finished her high school education at Limuru High School, outside Nairobi, Kenya, at the same time that the then Tanganyika (later Tanzania) became independent. She continued her studies in languages and business in London and Paris, then worked in an international organization, [[European Launcher Development Organisation]] (precursor to the [[European Space Agency]]), before taking another degree at [http://www.efap.com EFAP], the French communications school. She married [[British people|British]] scientist Albert Rundle Cook<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedariennews.net/2018/01/01/rundle-cook|title=Rundle Cook|work=The Darien News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}</ref> and moved to New York, where she divided her time between art and non-fiction writing, publishing work in [https://burlingtonindex.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/things-of-beauty-joys-for-ever-the-connoisseur-magazine-1901-1951/ Connoisseur Magazine] and other publications.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.loweraltamahahistoricalsociety.org/Newsletters/1990-1999/1992_August.pdf|title=Lower Altamaha Historical Society Newsletter}}</ref> Cook and her husband moved to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1983, where she became a full-time artist.<ref name=\"The Art List Interview\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartlist.com/aom_11_08.html|title=The Art List Interview}}</ref> Cook works from her studios in coastal Georgia and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Mallorca]].

Highly conscious of metalpoint\u2019s illustrious heritage, Cook draws mostly in silver, always from real life, and does not lay out any preparatory indications on the drawing surface before starting her drawing in metal. She believes that working directly from life confers spontaneity to a drawing, making it possible for intuition to guide the drawing and allowing the subject matter to dictate. For Cook, this method of drawing allows for unexpected results and opportunities to grow as an artist.\n[[File:Miro's Pine Tree 1, by Jeannine Cook.jpg|left|thumb|160x160px|Miro's Pine Tree 1, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook]]\nRigorous in her choice of archival-quality materials, Cook most often prepares her smooth drawing supports in advance with acrylic-based grounds,<ref>http://www.asllinea.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Materials1.pdf</ref> particularly if she is drawing outdoors in hot and insect-filled environments.

Deeply passionate about environmental issues, Cook reminds us to wake up, to look, to truly see nature. Her art acts as an advocate for a more informed look at our planet, at details that reveal nature's past and present: hurricane-struck red cedar trees that become burnished silver skeletons, tree barks that bespeak age and endurance, stones that tell of past geological dramas. Given that the majority of the world\u2019s population is now urban, Cook sees the need to share with art lovers the intricacy, elegance and vital importance of even the smallest aspect of life in the natural world. The rarity and allure of the lustrous metalpoint medium arouse curiosity and offer a starting point for dialogue about much wider environmental issues and the rewards that await us when we awaken to nature\u2019s riches.<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Remembering (Catteleya), graphite, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Remembering (Catteleya), graphite, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Palmetto Frond .jpg|Palmetto Frond, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Stone Lace I, silverpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Stone Lace I, silverpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Stone Lace II, by Jeannine Cook.jpg|Stone Lace II, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook\nFile:Japanese Maple Bark, silverpoint, copperpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook.jpg|Japanese Maple Bark, silverpoint, copperpoint, Prismacolour, Jeannine Cook\n</gallery>\n\n===Exhibitions===\n[[File:Pensando en Miro 1, by Jeannine Cook.jpg|thumb|Pensando en Mir\u00f3 1, silverpoint, Plike paper, Jeannine Cook|alt=|150x150px]]\nCook's metalpoint drawings have been shown in solo exhibitions in over a dozen museums and galleries in the past ten years, while she has also participated in more than twenty-two juried or invitational metalpoint gallery and museum group shows since 2010 in the United States and Europe.

He was the first of many people to ascend to the office of Governor from the Secretaryship.\n\n==Early career==\nBorn in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], Garvey graduated from St. Aloysius High School and worked for the [[Illinois Central Railroad]]. In 1909, he moved to the [[Arizona Territory]] to work as a railroad accountant for Randolph Railroad Co., a company later absorbed by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]. Later, he entered the automobile business, but it failed during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n==Political career==\nGarvey was hired by the [[Pima County]] treasurer's office in 1931. He became Pima County treasurer in 1935 and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] city treasurer in 1938. Garvey became known throughout Arizona during the next two decades as a dedicated public servant. He moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in 1940 when he was hired as assistant to Secretary of State Harry M. Moore. Upon Moore's death in 1942, Garvey was appointed to succeed him by Governor [[Sidney Preston Osborn|Sidney P. Osborn]], himself the first Secretary of State during most of the 1910s. Garvey was elected to the office twice, in 1944 and 1946.\n\nGarvey assumed the governorship, in accordance with Arizona law, when Osborn died on May 25, 1948.

He was the first of many people to ascend to the office of Governor from the Secretaryship.\n\n==Early career==\nBorn in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], Garvey graduated from St. Aloysius High School and worked for the [[Illinois Central Railroad]]. In 1909, he moved to the [[Arizona Territory]] to work as a railroad accountant for Randolph Railroad Co., a company later absorbed by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]. Later, he entered the automobile business, but it failed during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n==Political career==\nGarvey was hired by the [[Pima County]] treasurer's office in 1931. He became Pima County treasurer in 1935 and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] city treasurer in 1938. Garvey became known throughout Arizona during the next two decades as a dedicated public servant. He moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in 1940 when he was hired as assistant to Secretary of State Harry M. Moore. Upon Moore's death in 1942, Garvey was appointed to succeed him by Governor [[Sidney Preston Osborn|Sidney P. Osborn]], himself the first Secretary of State during most of the 1910s. Garvey was elected to the office twice, in 1944 and 1946.\n\nGarvey assumed the governorship, in accordance with Arizona law, when Osborn died on May 25, 1948.

In 2011, the company was accused of fraud and found itself under investigation by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Ontario Securities Commission]]. On March 30, 2012 Sino-Forest filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. It also announced that the company would be sold or restructured, with the proceeds going to its creditors. On July 13, 2017, the OSC released its decision finding that Sino-Forest and four individuals, including former CEO Allen Chan, committed fraud.\n\n== History ==\nThe company was formed in 1994 and subsequently claimed that its principal businesses included the ownership and management of tree plantations and complementary manufacturing of downstream engineered-wood products. The company claimed to derive most of its revenue from the sales of [[wood fibre]] needed to produce industrial, commercial and residential wood products. Sino-Forest also held a majority interest in Omnicorp Limited, an investment [[holding company]] listed in Hong Kong (HK:0094) that in turn claimed to import wood fibre into China.

In addition, Sino-Forest owned HK$212 million of convertible bonds of Omnicorp, which if fully converted would increase Sino-Forest's interest to nearly 60% of the enlarged issued share capital of Omnicorp.\n\nThe principal activities of Omnicorp's subsidiaries claimed to consist of log harvesting, lumber processing and marketing and sales of logs and lumber products to China and other countries around the world. Omnicorp claimed to own 60.4% of the harvesting and other rights in a 184,000-hectare hardwood forest concession in Suriname, South America and Sino-Forest, through its wholly owned subsidiary Sino-Capital Global Inc. owned the remaining 39.6%. Omnicorp also intended to acquire a high quality radiata pine plantation in New Zealand upon satisfaction of certain conditions as announced on November 3, 2010.\n\n==ARCPE==\nSino-Forest Applied Research Centre for Pearl River Delta Environment (ARCPE) officially opened on 22 June 2009 at the [[Hong Kong Baptist University]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = HKBU sets up territory's first applied research centre for Pearl River Delta environment|url = http://net2.hkbu.edu.hk/~enews/view_article.php?id=6165|publisher = [[Hong Kong Baptist University]]|date = 23 June 2009}}</ref> The Centre remains active with Sino-Forest name.\n\n==Reported financial position as of December 31, 2010==\nThe company's claimed assets grew significantly from 2004 to 2010.
