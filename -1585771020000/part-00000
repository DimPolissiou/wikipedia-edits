The city is divided into three regions, the West Side, on the west side of the Fox River, the East Side, between the eastern bank of the Fox River and the Kane/DuPage County line, and the Far East Side/Fox Valley, which is from the County Line to the city's eastern border with [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]].\n\nThe Aurora area has some significant architecture, including structures by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruce Goff]] and [[George Grant Elmslie]]. Aurora is also home to a large collection of [[Sears Catalog Home]]s (over 50 homes) and [[Lustron house|Lustron]] all-steel homes (seven homes). The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with {{convert|53,000|sqft|m2}} and 1,200 gaming positions, is located along the river in downtown Aurora.\n\n==History==\nBefore European settlers arrived, there was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. In 1834, following the [[Black Hawk War]], the McCarty brothers arrived. They initially owned land on both sides of the river, but sold their lands to the Lake brothers on the west side. The Lake brothers opened a mill on the opposite side of the river. The McCartys lived and operated their mill on the east side.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|title=Aurora, IL|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210094756/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|archivedate=10 December 2008}}</ref> A post office was established in 1837, officially creating Aurora.\n\nAurora was originally two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845,<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\">{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|title=History of Aurora, Illinois|first=K.|last=Torp|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|archivedate=9 July 2012}}</ref> on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854.<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\"/> In 1857, the two towns joined officially, incorporated as the city of Aurora.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| title = Aurora Township, Kane County, Illinois| encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois| publisher = Kane County Illinois Genealogy Trails| accessdate = 24 September 2011| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| archivedate = 9 July 2012}}</ref> As representatives could not agree which side of the river should house the public buildings, most public buildings were built on or around [[Stolp Island]] in the middle of the river.\n\nAs the city grew, it attracted numerous factories and jobs. In 1856, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] located its [[Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Roundhouse and Locomotive Shop|roundhouse and locomotive shop]] in Aurora, becoming the town's largest employer, a rank it held until the 1960s. Railroad restructuring in the railroad industry resulted in a loss of jobs as the number of railroads reduced and they dropped lines for passenger traffic. Aurora at one time had regularly scheduled passenger trains to Chicago.<ref>The Burlington Railroad ran passenger trains between Chicago and Aurora for over 100 years, since Aurora was an important suburb. See \"Chicago-Aurora Centennial, 1864\u20131964\" (Burlington Railroad, 1964).</ref>\n\nThe heavy industries on the East side provided employment for generations of European immigrants, who came from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]. Aurora became the economic center of the [[Fox Valley (Illinois)|Fox Valley region]]. The combination of these three factors\u2014a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington railroad's shops\u2014accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora's political, economic, and social history. The city openly supported [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] before the [[American Civil War]]. [[Mexico|Mexican]] migrants began arriving after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. Socially, the town was [[progressivism|progressive]] in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 here and the city established a high school for girls in 1855.\n\nThe city developed as a manufacturing powerhouse and continued until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Soon many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development began of the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas. While this was financially beneficial to the city, it drew off retail businesses and manufacturing from downtown and the industrial sectors of the near East and West Sides, respectively, weakening them. In the mid-1980s crime rates soared and street gangs started to form.\n\nDuring this time Aurora became a much more ethnically diverse city. The Latino population began to grow rapidly in the city in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the city's outskirts. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up around the city, and Aurora's population soared.\n\nToday, Aurora is an ethnically diverse city of around 200,000 residents. Historic areas downtown are being redeveloped, and new developments are being built all over the city.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aurora picture.jpg|thumb|The Phillips Park 'Sunken Garden']]\n\nAurora is at {{Coord|41|45|50|N|88|17|24|W|display=inline}} (41.7637855, \u221288.2901352).<ref name=\"gnis\"/>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Aurora has an area of {{convert|45.799|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|44.94|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 98.12%) is land and {{convert|0.859|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 1.88%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |title=G001 \u2013 Geographic Identifiers \u2013 2010 Census Summary File 1\n |accessdate=2015-12-25\n |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213041547/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |archive-date=2020-02-13\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nWhile the city has traditionally been regarded as being in [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]], Aurora also includes parts of [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]] and [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] counties.

Flooding occurred in almost every low-lying area in the city, and in neighborhoods bordering the Fox River, causing major damage in some neighborhoods. The flooding was just as bad in Blackberry Creek, on Aurora's far west side.\n\nAurora has not been struck by any major tornadoes in recent history, although they occur in Northern Illinois annually. In 1906, a tornado went through the [[Aurora Downs|Aurora Driving Park]], a large recreation/amusement park and race track where the Riddle Highlands neighborhood and Northgate shopping center is today. The tornado hit during the afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers \"Greatest Show on Earth\" circus, when the park was crowded. It killed 2 people and injured 22, but the grandstand was still filled for the evening performance. Weak tornadoes struck the city in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1991. In 1990, the supercell thunderstorm that produced the deadly [[1990 Plainfield tornado|Plainfield Tornado]] passed over the city, dropping golf ball sized hail and causing wind damage. Less than ten minutes after passing through Aurora, the storm produced an F5 tornado, which touched down in nearby Oswego, less than 5 miles from downtown. The tornado then traveled through Plainfield and Joliet, killing 29 people.\n\nThe city can receive heavy snowfall and experiences blizzards periodically.\n\nAurora was hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever [[List of earthquakes in Illinois|to strike Illinois]], a M 5.1, on May 26, 1909.

The city is the final stop of the [[BNSF Railway Line|Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] line of the [[Metra]] commuter rail system, allowing rail service into [[Chicago]].  The city also has a stop at the [[Route 59 (Metra)|Rt. 59 station]] on the BNSF Line. This station is on the border with Naperville and each city maintains a parking lot on their respective side of the tracks. The [[BNSF Railroad]] owns and maintains a [[rail yard]] in Aurora, which they named Eola Yard.\n\n[[Pace (transit)|Pace Suburban Bus]] operates local bus service in Aurora six days a week (no service on Sundays) and connects to cities and village such as Naperville, Geneva, Batavia, Oswego, and St. Charles.

The closest Amtrak station is in [[Naperville station|Napervile]]. Aurora City Lines, the old city bus lines, was closed in the late 1980s in favor of regional bus service. Aurora also had an extensive [[Tram|streetcar]] system, operated by the [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company]], that served most neighborhoods. Aurora was served by a number of [[interurban]] lines, the most prominent of which was the [[Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad]] which provided service into Chicago. The [[Suburban Transit Access Route|STAR Line]] would have a third station at Ferry Rd. north of the BNSF Line.\n\nThe [[Aurora Municipal Airport (Illinois)|Aurora Municipal Airport]] is a general aviation airport in Sugar Grove, Illinois, just outside Aurora. Although the airport is in Sugar Grove, it is owned and operated by the City of Aurora. The Aurora Airport is designed as a reliever airport for Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports and also handles a lot of international cargo. It is capable of landing Boeing 757 aircraft. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center is on Aurora's west side.\n\n===Healthcare===\n[[File:Rush-Copley Medical Center.JPG|thumb|[[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]]]]\nAurora has two hospitals, one on the west side, Presence Mercy Medical Center, and one in Fox Valley, [[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]].\n\nThere are other area hospitals, including Edward Hospital in Naperville, Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Central DuPage in Winfield and a Level 1 Trauma center at Good Samaritan in Downers Grove.\n\nAurora had three hospitals, St. Joseph Hospital, on the west side, St. Charles hospital, east of downtown, and Copley Memorial Hospital, on the east side. St Joseph and St, Charles hospitals have been converted into senior living centers, and the old Copley hospital, which was one of the largest hospitals in the area, sits vacant. The city of Aurora recently demolished the old smokestacks from the hospital, as they were starting to crumble.\n\n[https://archive.today/20130110200534/http://www.dreyermed.com/ Dreyer Medical Clinic] and several other independent clinics and medical groups are spread throughout the city.

According to the census of Aurora's population over the age of twenty-five, 26% hold a bachelor's degree.\n\nStarting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox.  Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.\n\nDue to the city's size, these are not the only three school systems serving residents \u2013 some students in the far north end of the city (north of [[Interstate 88 (west)|I88]] in Kane County) attend [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in [[Maple Park, Illinois|Maple Park]]), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]] public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf's Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High are within Aurora's limits.\n\nThe [[Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy]] (IMSA) is a state-funded residential [[magnet school]] for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of Aurora's other public schools.

The city is divided into three regions, the West Side, on the west side of the Fox River, the East Side, between the eastern bank of the Fox River and the Kane/DuPage County line, and the Far East Side/Fox Valley, which is from the County Line to the city's eastern border with [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]].\n\nThe Aurora area has some significant architecture, including structures by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruce Goff]] and [[George Grant Elmslie]]. Aurora is also home to a large collection of [[Sears Catalog Home]]s (over 50 homes) and [[Lustron house|Lustron]] all-steel homes (seven homes). The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with {{convert|53,000|sqft|m2}} and 1,200 gaming positions, is located along the river in downtown Aurora.\n\n==History==\nBefore European settlers arrived, there was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. In 1834, following the [[Black Hawk War]], the McCarty brothers arrived. They initially owned land on both sides of the river, but sold their lands to the Lake brothers on the west side. The Lake brothers opened a mill on the opposite side of the river. The McCartys lived and operated their mill on the east side.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|title=Aurora, IL|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210094756/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|archivedate=10 December 2008}}</ref> A post office was established in 1837, officially creating Aurora.\n\nAurora was originally two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845,<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\">{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|title=History of Aurora, Illinois|first=K.|last=Torp|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|archivedate=9 July 2012}}</ref> on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854.<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\"/> In 1857, the two towns joined officially, incorporated as the city of Aurora.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| title = Aurora Township, Kane County, Illinois| encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois| publisher = Kane County Illinois Genealogy Trails| accessdate = 24 September 2011| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| archivedate = 9 July 2012}}</ref> As representatives could not agree which side of the river should house the public buildings, most public buildings were built on or around [[Stolp Island]] in the middle of the river.\n\nAs the city grew, it attracted numerous factories and jobs. In 1856, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] located its [[Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Roundhouse and Locomotive Shop|roundhouse and locomotive shop]] in Aurora, becoming the town's largest employer, a rank it held until the 1960s. Railroad restructuring in the railroad industry resulted in a loss of jobs as the number of railroads reduced and they dropped lines for passenger traffic. Aurora at one time had regularly scheduled passenger trains to Chicago.<ref>The Burlington Railroad ran passenger trains between Chicago and Aurora for over 100 years, since Aurora was an important suburb. See \"Chicago-Aurora Centennial, 1864\u20131964\" (Burlington Railroad, 1964).</ref>\n\nThe heavy industries on the East side provided employment for generations of European immigrants, who came from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]. Aurora became the economic center of the [[Fox Valley (Illinois)|Fox Valley region]]. The combination of these three factors\u2014a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington railroad's shops\u2014accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora's political, economic, and social history. The city openly supported [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] before the [[American Civil War]]. [[Mexico|Mexican]] migrants began arriving after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. Socially, the town was [[progressivism|progressive]] in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 here and the city established a high school for girls in 1855.\n\nThe city developed as a manufacturing powerhouse and continued until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Soon many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development began of the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas. While this was financially beneficial to the city, it drew off retail businesses and manufacturing from downtown and the industrial sectors of the near East and West Sides, respectively, weakening them. In the mid-1980s crime rates soared and street gangs started to form.\n\nDuring this time Aurora became a much more ethnically diverse city. The Latino population began to grow rapidly in the city in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the city's outskirts. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up around the city, and Aurora's population soared.\n\nToday, Aurora is an ethnically diverse city of around 200,000 residents. Historic areas downtown are being redeveloped, and new developments are being built all over the city.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aurora picture.jpg|thumb|The Phillips Park 'Sunken Garden']]\n\nAurora is at {{Coord|41|45|50|N|88|17|24|W|display=inline}} (41.7637855, \u221288.2901352).<ref name=\"gnis\"/>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Aurora has an area of {{convert|45.799|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|44.94|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 98.12%) is land and {{convert|0.859|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 1.88%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |title=G001 \u2013 Geographic Identifiers \u2013 2010 Census Summary File 1\n |accessdate=2015-12-25\n |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213041547/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |archive-date=2020-02-13\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nWhile the city has traditionally been regarded as being in [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]], Aurora also includes parts of [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]] and [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] counties.

Its name is deceptive because it is actually the part of the city ''farthest'' from the Fox River and its valley. The area acquired its name because of its proximity to the [[Westfield Fox Valley|Westfield Fox Valley Mall]] and Fox Valley Villages, one of the first housing developments to be constructed after the mall.\n\n===Climate===\nThe annual precipitation for Aurora is about 40&nbsp;inches.

Flooding occurred in almost every low-lying area in the city, and in neighborhoods bordering the Fox River, causing major damage in some neighborhoods. The flooding was just as bad in Blackberry Creek, on Aurora's far west side.\n\nAurora has not been struck by any major tornadoes in recent history, although they occur in Northern Illinois annually. In 1906, a tornado went through the [[Aurora Downs|Aurora Driving Park]], a large recreation/amusement park and race track where the Riddle Highlands neighborhood and Northgate shopping center is today. The tornado hit during the afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers \"Greatest Show on Earth\" circus, when the park was crowded. It killed 2 people and injured 22, but the grandstand was still filled for the evening performance. Weak tornadoes struck the city in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1991. In 1990, the supercell thunderstorm that produced the deadly [[1990 Plainfield tornado|Plainfield Tornado]] passed over the city, dropping golf ball sized hail and causing wind damage. Less than ten minutes after passing through Aurora, the storm produced an F5 tornado, which touched down in nearby Oswego, less than 5 miles from downtown. The tornado then traveled through Plainfield and Joliet, killing 29 people.\n\nThe city can receive heavy snowfall and experiences blizzards periodically.\n\nAurora was hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever [[List of earthquakes in Illinois|to strike Illinois]], a M 5.1, on May 26, 1909.

The construction of the campus was part of a larger plan to redevelop the Downtown area, putting in parks and new walking paths, and making the area more inviting. The plan also included a pedestrian bridge to connect the banks of the river. Also in the works is a plan to modify or reconstruct the bridges to Stolp Island, which have not been maintained for nearly 60 years.\n\n===Museums===\n*[[Aurora Historical Society]]\n* [[Aurora Regional Fire Museum]]\n* The Aurora Public Arts Commission\n* [[Grand Army of the Republic Hall (Aurora, Illinois)|Grand Army of the Republic Hall]]\n* [[Phillips Park Zoo]]\n* David L.

The city is the final stop of the [[BNSF Railway Line|Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] line of the [[Metra]] commuter rail system, allowing rail service into [[Chicago]].  The city also has a stop at the [[Route 59 (Metra)|Rt. 59 station]] on the BNSF Line. This station is on the border with Naperville and each city maintains a parking lot on their respective side of the tracks. The [[BNSF Railroad]] owns and maintains a [[rail yard]] in Aurora, which they named Eola Yard.\n\n[[Pace (transit)|Pace Suburban Bus]] operates local bus service in Aurora six days a week (no service on Sundays) and connects to cities and village such as Naperville, Geneva, Batavia, Oswego, and St. Charles.

Aurora also had an extensive [[Tram|streetcar]] system, operated by the [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company]], that served most neighborhoods. Aurora was served by a number of [[interurban]] lines, the most prominent of which was the [[Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad]] which provided service into Chicago. The [[Suburban Transit Access Route|STAR Line]] would have a third station at Ferry Rd. north of the BNSF Line.\n\nThe [[Aurora Municipal Airport (Illinois)|Aurora Municipal Airport]] is a general aviation airport in Sugar Grove, Illinois, just outside Aurora. Although the airport is in Sugar Grove, it is owned and operated by the City of Aurora. The Aurora Airport is designed as a reliever airport for Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports and also handles a lot of international cargo. It is capable of landing Boeing 757 aircraft. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center is on Aurora's west side.\n\n===Healthcare===\n[[File:Rush-Copley Medical Center.JPG|thumb|[[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]]]]\nAurora has two hospitals, one on the west side, Presence Mercy Medical Center, and one in Fox Valley, [[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]].\n\nThere are other area hospitals, including Edward Hospital in Naperville, Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Central DuPage in Winfield and a Level 1 Trauma center at Good Samaritan in Downers Grove.\n\nAurora had three hospitals, St. Joseph Hospital, on the west side, St. Charles hospital, east of downtown, and Copley Memorial Hospital, on the east side. St Joseph and St, Charles hospitals have been converted into senior living centers, and the old Copley hospital, which was one of the largest hospitals in the area, sits vacant. The city of Aurora recently demolished the old smokestacks from the hospital, as they were starting to crumble.\n\n[https://archive.today/20130110200534/http://www.dreyermed.com/ Dreyer Medical Clinic] and several other independent clinics and medical groups are spread throughout the city.

According to the census of Aurora's population over the age of twenty-five, 26% hold a bachelor's degree.\n\nStarting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox.  Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.\n\nDue to the city's size, these are not the only three school systems serving residents \u2013 some students in the far north end of the city (north of [[Interstate 88 (west)|I88]] in Kane County) attend [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in [[Maple Park, Illinois|Maple Park]]), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]] public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf's Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High are within Aurora's limits.\n\nThe [[Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy]] (IMSA) is a state-funded residential [[magnet school]] for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of Aurora's other public schools. Any Illinois student who meets admission requirements may apply to attend IMSA, tuition free.\n\nAurora is also home to other private schools. Within Aurora, there are three Roman Catholic High Schools, [[Aurora Central Catholic High School|Aurora Central Catholic]] (Diocese of Rockford), [[Rosary High School (Aurora, Illinois)|Rosary]], and [[Marmion Academy]] (Order of St. Benedict), and seven Catholic elementary schools operated by the Diocese of Rockford. Along with these three schools is [[Aurora Christian High School]] and Elementary School and Resurrection Lutheran School,<ref>{{cite web |title=Resurrection Lutheran Church & School |url=https://relcs.org/}}</ref> a Pre-K-8 grade school of the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]].  Aurora is also home to Fox Valley Montessori School, one of the first Montessori schools established in Illinois in 1969, which offers a preschool and elementary program.\n\nThe above-named districts have forty-six public schools within the city limits of Aurora (seventeen for District #131, thirteen for District #129, eleven for District #204, four for Oswego District #308 and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy).\n\n===Library===\nThe [[Aurora Public Library (Illinois)|Aurora Public Library]] includes the main library, two branches, an express center, a support facility and a bookmobile.

The school was named after [[David and Mary Thomson]], the first European settlers that immigrated to Scarborough in the late 18th century.

The building was designed by the architects Peter L.

[[W. A. Porter Collegiate Institute]], the fifth, had opened the year before. These two years marked the beginning of a rapid growth period in the Scarborough school system necessitated by equally rapid growth in business and industry and in population. The school underwent additions in the 1960s and 1970s including extra classrooms, new gymnasia for girls and boys, science labs, an enlarged library, and vocational shops.\n\nIn 1989, following the loss of [[Tabor Park Vocational School]] to the Metropolitan Separate School Board, Thomson became as a third campus for [[Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies]]; the latter moved to [[Centennial College]] in 1994.\n\nIn June 2000, [[Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute]] was closed; students in its former catchment area are now served by Thomson.\n\nThe capacity of the original facility is 1,623 pupils.

Due to delays regarding construction issues ranging from weather to workers strike, the merged Thomson-Bendale student body operated from the existing Lawrence building until construction was completed. Thomson's new building officially opened on December 10, 2019 and features a four-storey modern building, cafetorium, two double gymnasiums and school-wide WiFi.\n\n[[File:DMTLockerPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|Lockers in the 140s hallway in the original building.]]\n\n==Logo==\nReginald H. King, head of the Scarborough Board of Education when Thomson opened, was a classicist. The motto ''Nil sine magno labore'' (Nothing without great effort) \u2013 which is also used by [[Brooklyn College]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]] \u2013 was selected as most appropriate from his collection of Latin mottos and was incorporated in the Thomson logo, which remains unchanged. The motto appears at the base of a scarlet maple leaf on which are superimposed a [[Lantern|lamp of learning]] and the initials D and M in white. The leaf is flanked by a large \"C\" and \"I\", both in black forming arcs of a circle with the lower sections of the motto. Finally the name \"Thomson\", white on a scarlet background, surmounts the rest of the design and completes the circle. The school colours were originally scarlet, black and white.\n\n==Academics and Extracurricular Activities==\nThomson has the following departments: Visual and Performing Arts; Business, Coop and Careers; English; History/Geography; Languages (including [[English as a second language|ESL]] and modern languages); Mathematics; Physical Education; Science; Social Studies; and Technological Studies.

These two years marked the beginning of a rapid growth period in the Scarborough school system necessitated by equally rapid growth in business and industry and in population. The school underwent additions in the 1960s and 1970s including extra classrooms, new gymnasia for girls and boys, science labs, an enlarged library, and vocational shops.\n\nIn 1989, following the loss of [[Tabor Park Vocational School]] to the Metropolitan Separate School Board, Thomson became as a third campus for [[Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies]]; the latter moved to [[Centennial College]] in 1994.\n\nIn June 2000, [[Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute]] was closed; students in its former catchment area are now served by Thomson.\n\nThe capacity of the original facility is 1,623 pupils.

The new school, under its project name, ''Lawrence Midland Secondary School'', is designed in conjunction with the architectural firms of ZAS Architects and Taylor+Smith.\n\nThe new school was originally expected to be scheduled to open in September 2019 on Brockley Drive. Due to delays regarding construction issues ranging from weather to workers strike, the merged Thomson-Bendale student body operated from the existing Lawrence building until construction was completed. Thomson's new building officially opened on December 10, 2019 and features a four-storey modern building, cafetorium, two double gymnasiums and school-wide WiFi.\n\n[[File:DMTLockerPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|Lockers in the 140s hallway in the original building.]]\n\n==Logo==\nReginald H. King, head of the Scarborough Board of Education when Thomson opened, was a classicist. The motto ''Nil sine magno labore'' (Nothing without great effort) \u2013 which is also used by [[Brooklyn College]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]] \u2013 was selected as most appropriate from his collection of Latin mottos and was incorporated in the Thomson logo, which remains unchanged. The motto appears at the base of a scarlet maple leaf on which are superimposed a [[Lantern|lamp of learning]] and the initials D and M in white. The leaf is flanked by a large \"C\" and \"I\", both in black forming arcs of a circle with the lower sections of the motto. Finally the name \"Thomson\", white on a scarlet background, surmounts the rest of the design and completes the circle. The school colours were originally scarlet, black and white.\n\n==Academics and Extracurricular Activities==\nThomson has the following departments: Visual and Performing Arts; Business, Coop and Careers; English; History/Geography; Languages (including [[English as a second language|ESL]] and modern languages); Mathematics; Physical Education; Science; Social Studies; and Technological Studies. The school offers [[Advanced Placement|pre-AP and AP]] courses in seven subjects. David and Mary Thomson CI hosts the well-known SHSM programs: Health & Wellness SHSM, Information Communications Technology SHSM, & Horticulture and Landscaping SHSM.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thomsoncollegiate.com/ |title=David and Mary Thomson Collegiate |accessdate=April 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to above, Thomson inherited a number of courses from Bendale including construction technology, baking and cooking and technological design.\n\nThe school fields teams in many sports: archery, baseball and slo-pitch, badminton, basketball, cricket, cross country, curling, football, field and ice hockey, rugby, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and field, Ultimate Frisbee, volleyball, and wrestling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thomsoncollegiate.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197&Itemid=229 |title=List of Teams |publisher=David and Mary Thomson Collegiate |date=December 28, 2014 }}</ref> The school's team name was formerly known as the ''Thomson Redmen'', which had a logo of a [[Native American]] head although its football team was called ''Thomson Pioneers'' (1959-1962) for a short period.

It can also read [[Protein Data Bank|PDB (Protein Data Bank)]] from a file, or files placed in a directory, as input.\n*''Penrose'' &ndash; tiles the screen aperiodically with coloured [[Penrose tile]]s.\n*''Spotlight'' &ndash; puts a moving spotlight across the desktop in the style of the [[James Bond]] film opening sequences.\n*''Sproingies'' &ndash; an animation in the style of the video game ''[[Q*bert]]''.\n*''Webcollage'' &ndash; creates collages out of random images found on the Web.\n*''XAnalogTV'' &ndash; simulates an analog [[cathode ray tube]] television set, including visual artifacts and reception issues.\n*''XPlanet'' &ndash; draws [[planet]]s and other celestial bodies that update in real time.\n*''XMatrix'' &ndash; animations similar to the \"[[Matrix digital rain|digital rain]]\" sequence seen in the [[Matrix trilogy]].\n\nSome of the included hacks are very similar to [[demo effect]]s created by the [[demoscene]]:\n* ''Boing'' &ndash; based on the 1984 program regarded as the first [[Amiga demo]] ever, showing the bouncing red and white ball.\n* ''Bumps'' &ndash; an implementation of full-screen 2D [[fake bump mapping|bump mapping]].\n* ''[[Metaballs|MetaBalls]]'' &ndash; another common demo effect.\n* ''Moire2'' &ndash; moving [[moir\u00e9 pattern|interference circles]] similar to those common in older Amiga demos.\n* ''ShadeBobs'' &ndash; another effect common in older Amiga demos.\n* ''XFlame'' &ndash; the filter-based fire effect, also known as flame effect.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|Linux|Free and open-source software}}\n{{Commons category-inline|XScreenSaver}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/}}\n* {{Freshmeat|xscreensaver|XScreenSaver}}\n\n[[Category:Screensavers]]\n[[Category:Utilities for macOS]]\n[[Category:X Window programs]]\n", "name_user": "Mattl", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XScreenSaver"}
