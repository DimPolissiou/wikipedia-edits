The company folded in 1813, nevertheless, it left clear footprints that can still be seen in Gothenburg.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Swedish East India Company |url=https://www.soic.se/the-swedish-east-india-company/en |website=www.soic.se |publisher=Svenska Ostindiska Companiet}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\nSweden was the last of the more prominent seafaring European nations to engage in the East India Trade. The royal privileges for the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) were granted almost a century after the other European trading companies were established.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=28}}\n\nWith the advent of the East India trade in the 17th century, Chinese and Indian goods were imported to Sweden. Drinking tea and having Chinese objects became the height of fashion among Swedish socialites and the middle class. Chinese culture, philosophy, art, agriculture, and architecture were also studied and copied. The most prominent example of this is the [[Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm]], which was followed by smaller parks like the one built by [[Jean Abraham Grill]] at [[Grill (family)#Godeg\u00e5rd|Godeg\u00e5rd]]. China was considered a model community, a template for how a country should be governed. This culminated during the 18th century, when many Swedish scientists and politicians even suggested that Sweden should be governed by intellectual bureaucrats, \"[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]]\", led by a sovereign king in a Chinese manner.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|pp=22\u201325}}\n\n=== Early attempts ===\n\nThe first attempt of organizing a Swedish East India trading company was made by a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] merchant, [[Willem Usselincx]].{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=10}} During the 17th century, the Dutch merchants dominated the [[History of Gothenburg|newly founded]] [[Gothenburg]] on the west coast of Sweden. The town was considered ideal for Sweden's international trade since most of the goods were transported on ships and this was the only major Swedish port accessible without having to pass the [[Denmark|Danish]] customs at [[\u00d8resund]].{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=29}} On 14{{nbsp}}June 1626, Usselincx received royal privileges for a trading company for twelve years, from the Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]]. The privileges included clauses about the ethics of trading with foreign, indigenous people. The first priority was to establish friendly, long-term relations that would be mutually beneficiary for both parties. The venture was supported by a number of prominent Swedes, including the King himself, but raising the necessary money proved harder. Political difficulties and Sweden's participation in the [[Thirty Years' War]], where King Gustav II was killed, put an end to the plans. The resources were instead used for a smaller company, trading within Europe.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe next attempt to start a trading company was made in 1661, by German merchant Erlenkamp, who suggested a route over the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Northern Sea Route]], past [[Japan]] and further on to [[China]] and [[India]]. The aim was to bypass the Spanish and Portuguese blockades.  The plan did not gain any support as the ice barriers proved even more difficult.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=11}} At the end of the 1660s, a petition from diplomat and London resident Johan Leijonbergh was sent to the Swedish King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] regarding one Olle Borg who had worked in the [[Dutch East India Company]] for eighteen years. Borg stated that if there was a war between Sweden and Denmark, he could deliver the Danish fort in [[Tharangambadi]], India, to the Swedes. Knut Kurck, Peter Schnack and Johan Olivecreutz were appointed directors for the company, but the political unrest in Sweden at that time plus trouble with actually getting the money that had been promised from the investors thwarted this venture as well, and in 1674, the charter was dissolved. Residual resources were used to send two ships, the ''Solen'' (the Sun) and the ''Trumslagaren'' (the Drummer), to [[Lisbon]] for salt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=35\u201337}}\n\nA later attempt to establish the Swedish trade on the East Indies was made by pirates sailing out from [[Madagascar]]. After having attacked other trading ships, they had become wealthy and were looking for a place to settle down and invest their money in legitimate enterprise. The pirates numbered about 1,500 and commanded a considerable and well-armed fleet of ships. They started by offering the Swedish King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] half a million pounds sterling and 25 armed ships for his protection, but the matter was not resolved. In 1718, representatives for the pirates met again with the King at his camp during the [[Siege of Fredriksten|campaign against Norway]]. The new offer was for 60 ships, armed and stocked with goods, if the pirates were allowed to settle down in Gothenburg and start a trade with the East Indies under the Swedish flag. One privateer by the name of Morgan actually obtained a charter for an East India Company and a letter of appointment for himself as governor over the colonies that could be the result of such an enterprise. When the King was shot and died on 30{{nbsp}}November 1718, the venture folded.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=37}}\n\n=== Sweden after the Great Northern War ===\n\n[[File:Sockersk\u00e5l GM 7012.jpg|thumb|upright|Porcelain sugar bowl made in China c. 1770\u201390, imported by the SOIC, City Museum of Gothenburg]]\nSweden was impoverished after the [[Great Northern War]], and trade was seen as an option for rebuilding the country. Opinions about whether trade with the East Indies would be profitable enough diverged.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=12}} The greatest concern was that Sweden would not have enough resources to defend the company's ships and [[trading post]]s. The trading companies from [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] did not hesitate to attack other ships to prevent competition. A failed attempt to start a competing trade company in [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], the [[Ostend Company]], was discouraging.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nWhat finally made the Swedish venture possible was the strong support from foreign traders and merchants, foremost British but also Dutch, who had been shut out from the companies in their respective countries. The majority of the investors, as well as the buyers of the goods imported by the company, were foreigners.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nGranting permission for a charter was not entirely uncontroversial during that time when [[mercantilism]], which advocated regulations so that the production of export goods was promoted and import reduced, was the dominant idea for trade. Opposition became even more apparent after the first journey made by the ship ''Friedericus Rex Sueciaes'' in 1735.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=46}} Demands were made in the [[Riksdag]] for sanctions and restrictions for the trade company, a number of [[pamphlet]]s were written, arguing that Swedish steel and timber were wastefully being exchanged for such  \"worthless goods\" as tea and [[Canton porcelain|porcelain]].{{efn|Contemporary arguments pro and con concerning the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) are examined in the last chapter of Christian Koninckx.{{sfn|Koninckx|1980}}}} One of the most ardent critics against the charter was Johan Arckenholtz. He even spoke of the moral aspects, saying that the Swedish population \"would be weaned from work and crafts and lose their health, strength and spirit by using products from a warmer climate\".{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nThe emerging Swedish textile industry was also threatened by the trade, and the new company soon promised to refrain from shipping textiles. Of sixty-one successfully returning voyages between 1733 and 1767, only three (in 1735, 1740, and 1742) carried cotton and silk textiles and raw silk from [[Bengal]].{{efn|Koninckx, quoted in \"The European Trading Companies\".{{sfn|Johnson|Prakash|1998|p=80}}}} Some opposition may have been rooted in pure jealousy of the profits the SOIC were making from the trade.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|pp=43\u201345}} Those who supported the establishing of a Swedish trade company argued that if people wanted goods from China, they were going to buy them anyway and it would be better to import them using Swedish ships and trading company, and thereby keep the profits within Sweden.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=28}}\n\n== Establishing the SOIC ==\n[[File:Portrait of Colin Campbell 1756 - cropped.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Colin Campbell (Swedish East India Company)|Colin Campbell]] (1686\u20131757), co-founder and director of the SOIC]]\n[[File:Niclas Sahlgren oil painting - cropped.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Niclas Sahlgren]] (1701\u20131776), co-founder and director of the SOIC]]\n[[File:Henrik K\u00f6nig (1676- ) of the Swedish East India Company.jpg|thumb|160px|Henrik K\u00f6nig (1686\u20131736), co-founder and director of the SOIC]]\nWith the suspension of the charter for the Ostend company by the Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in May 1727, the investors in that company had to look for other ways to be part of the profitable East India trade and they now looked to Sweden.<ref name=Nordisk>{{cite encyclopedia | title =Ostindiska kompanier|trans-title=East India companies | encyclopedia =[[Nordisk familjebok]]\u2013Uggleupplagan | editor=Leche, V |editor2=Nystr\u00f6m, J.F. |editor3=Warburg, K |editor4=Westrin, Th | year =1914 |volume=20| publisher =Nordisk familjeboks f\u00f6rl. | url=http://runeberg.org/nfbt/0570.html | pp=1060\u20131062 | location =Stockholm | language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nScottish merchant [[Colin Campbell (Swedish East India Company)|Colin Campbell]], formerly active in the Ostend Company, met with Swedish [[Niclas Sahlgren]] during Sahlgren's stay in Amsterdam in the late 1720s. Together they made plans for a Swedish trading company, but it was evident that Campbell was the driving force in the enterprise. Since foreign investors were met with suspicion in Sweden, they needed a respectable Swede to front the company.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=20}} That person would be commissioner Henrik K\u00f6nig, a Swede of German ([[Bremen]]) origin.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=30}}\n\nIn 1729, Henrik K\u00f6nig submitted an application for a charter for two ships. He supported his request on the charter given previously to other applicants, but the reaction from the Swedish government was reluctant: the closing of the Ostend Company in 1731, following British pressure as part of the [[Treaty of Vienna (1731)|Treaty of Vienna]], boded ill for the Swedes' competition against the main powers when trade and politics were so intimately associated. K\u00f6nig took the matters to the Swedish parliament and succeeded, gaining royal privileges for the company on 14{{nbsp}}June 1731, initially for a period of 15 years.{{efn|The reappearance of some Antwerp bankers who had been members of the Ostend Company, as investors in the Swedish East India Company misled some historians in viewing the SOIC as a type of front for continuing the Ostend Company; this misperception was put to rest by Koninckx.{{sfn|Koninckx|1980}}}}{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=38\u201339}} These privileges were the First Charter, or the First [[Octroi]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=43}}\n\n=== The Royal charter ===\n\nThe charter was given to Henrik K\u00f6nig & Compagnie and consisted of eighteen precise paragraphs on how the trade should be conducted:{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=39\u201342}}\n\n#The company would have the right to all trade and shipping east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] as far as [[Japan]] excepting the port [[Factory (trading post)|factories]] of other European nations, unless free consent had been obtained in advance.\n#All departures and arrivals should be out of Gothenburg, and cargo was to be auctioned promptly in Gothenburg on arrival.\n#The Swedish state was to receive 100 [[Swedish riksdaler|riksdaler]] per ''l\u00e4st'' (c. 2.5 tonnes){{efn|A \"l\u00e4st\" was a unit to describe a ships [[tonnage]].

US$39.67 million).{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=67}}\n\nThe unwillingness of the established trading nations, primarily England, the Netherlands and France, to help and acknowledge the SOIC during the first years were founded on the suspicion that the company was merely a front for those merchants who wished to circumvent the rules and regulations of the East India trade in their own countries. These suspicions were well founded. All of the initiators of the SOIC were non-swedes or of foreign origin. Swedish law made it possible for anyone who invested in the company to receive Swedish citizenship and most of the crew aboard the ships during the first and the second octroi were foreigners. Of the 53 supercargoes during the first octroi,{{efn|The list on pages 177\u201378 in Kjellberg has 53 names of supercargoes in the first octroi, but in the summary it is stated that \"... there were 40 foreign against 11 Swedish supercargoes.\" during the first octroi.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=316}}}} about 22 percent were [[Swedes]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=124}}\n\n==== The first expedition ====\n\n[[File:AMH-4769-KB Residence of the governor general within the walls of the castle at Batavia.jpg|thumb|Residence of the governor general and the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] buildings in Batavia]]\nThe first expedition was organized by Campbell. His reconstructed diary of the voyage, rediscovered in 1986, contain a complete account of the expedition.{{efn|Campbell had destroyed his diary when the ship was taken by the Dutch and reconstructed it from memory and some loose papers; it was translated and published by Paul Hallberg and Christian Koninckx.{{sfn|Campbell|Hallberg|Koninckx|1996}}}} It started on 9{{nbsp}}February 1732, as the ship ''Friedericus Rex Sueciae'' sailed out from Gothenburg. Campbell was the first supercargo onboard and had also been appointed ambassador to the Chinese court by the King. The other three supercargos were English: Charles Graham, Charles Morford and John Pike. The captain of the ''Fredericus'' was Georg Herman af Trolle, a seasoned sailor who had been brought up in Amsterdam and previously served on English, French, Dutch and Danish ships. He had also been employed as a [[privateer]] by the town of [[Middelburg]]. Both he and Campbell had previously visited China. The crew for the ship was approximately one hundred men.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nThe expedition started well\u2014passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and crossing the [[Indian Ocean]], the vessel arrived safely in Canton (now known as [[Guangzhou]]), the trading port for foreigners in China at that time, in September 1732. For the next four months, trading was carried out successfully. Initially, different spices were the primary commodity along with tea, silk and miscellaneous luxury items, but on later voyages, porcelain and tea made up the bulk of the trade to meet the demand for such goods back in Europe.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=44\u201346}}\n\nOn its return, the vessel was stopped by the Dutch between [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]], and brought to [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]]. Campbell protested and produced his papers, but the Dutch argued that they had suspected the vessel of falsely flying the Swedish flag.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=44}} The expedition was eventually released,{{efn|\"Since which period the Swedish East India Company have been suffered to carry on their trade without the least interruption, but which is solely confined to China,\" Milburn in summary of the Swedish East India Company.{{sfn|Milburn|1813|pp=576\u201378}}}} but time was lost and the winds unfavourable. Many of the seamen died en route and the ship had to recruit new Norwegian sailors upon reaching the coast of Norway.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=42}}\n\nAlmost one and a half years after the departure, the vessel returned to Gothenburg on 27{{nbsp}}August 1733. The expedition was a huge economic success, the auction bringing in some 900,000 Swedish riksdaler. The dividend paid was 75% of the capital invested. According to the ledgers of the Gothenburg Main Customs Cambers for Sea Trade in 1733 to 1734, goods for 518,972 riksdaler were exported; the rest stayed in Sweden.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=45}}\n\n=== The second octroi (1746\u20131766) ===\n\n[[File:Canton Thirteen Factories map 1748-49 enhanced with translations.jpg|thumb|The riverside part of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] by Johan Fredrik Dalman, 1748\u201349]]\nThe charter was renewed in 1746, 1766 and 1786, creating the Second, Third and Fourth Octrois.{{sfn|Milburn|1813|p=577}}{{sfn|Koninckx|1980}}\n\nUnder the terms of the second charter 36 ships were sent out, three to [[Surat]], the rest to Canton, and only one was lost.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=314}}\n\nThe profit for the shareholders during the first charter generated large interest for a second charter. Except for the foreign investors, most of the merchants during the first charter had been from Gothenburg. With the second charter, a number of merchants from Stockholm started to show interest in the trade. On 23{{nbsp}}September 1745, a request for a second octroi was presented by the firm ''Abraham and Jacob Arfwedsson & Co''. They received a preliminary grant for it. A couple of weeks later, a second request for an octroi was made by the company ''Anders Plomgren & C:o'' and partner Carl Broman. The directors from the first charter submitted their request on 20{{nbsp}}January 1746.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=69\u201371}}\n\nA commission to investigate the applications was appointed on 24{{nbsp}}March 1746, and some weeks later on 14{{nbsp}}May, they concluded that the directors from the first charter were best suited to lead the second as well.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=71}} However, the number of directors was increased from three to at least seven. In addition to Colin Campbell, Niclas Sahlgren and Teodor Ankarcrona, the directors were former secretary of the Executive Board Magnus Lagerstr\u00f6m, the Stockholm merchants Anders Plomgren and [[Grill family#Abraham Grill (II) the Younger|Abraham Grill]]. These six members of the board later elected [[Claes Grill]], Jacob von Utfall Jeanson, S. N. Wenngren and Nils Str\u00f6m as directors.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=73}}\n\nThe second charter was for 20 years and the directors followed the ways of the first octroi. They collected the means from the investors to fund each of the first 14 ships separately. In 1753, the company was reorganized into a joint-stock company by creating a fixed fund where anyone could subscribe for shares, but not for less than 500 riksdaler in silver.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nEven after the company went public, it still retained its secrecy regarding the business. The management deliberately withheld information from the shareholders or lied about how profitable parts of the business were. The directors said that the profit from the trade with China was declining and that the company should be granted permission to send a ship to India, contrary to the regulations for the trade so far. An exemption was granted in 1749, and a ship was sent to Surat in India. On its return in 1752, that ship yielded a profit of 103% and two more ships were sent to Surat. The English and the Dutch controlled most of the trade in the town and did everything to prevent the Swedes from doing business there and several incidents occurred. The company decided to refocus in the China trade instead. That trade yielded an average profit of 30\u201340% during the second charter.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=314\u2013316}}\n\n=== The third octroi (1766\u20131786) ===\n\n[[File:Hongs at Canton.jpg|thumb|right|Canton [[Thirteen Factories]], with flags of Denmark, Spain, the U.S., Sweden, Britain, and the Netherlands, c. 1820]]\nWhen it was time to renew the charter in 1766, the first directors were Robert Finlay of Irish and Scottish origin,  Swedish Fabian L\u00f6wen and Georg Herman Conradi of German descent, all residing in Stockholm. With this the power within the management shifted from Gothenburg to Stockholm, where two new ships also were bought.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=131\u2013133}} The Swedish government extorted a loan at 6% interest to the SOIC to be paid during 1766\u201369, estimated in 1813 to have been the equivalent of \u00a3100,000, and another, interest-free, for half of that sum, to be repaid out of import duties,{{sfn|Milburn|1813|p=577}} in essence an advance payment of duty.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=317}}\n\nDuring the third charter, 39 voyages were made to Canton and none of the ships was lost or damaged, but the profit from the trade with China was declining. The turning point for Sweden came in 1780, with the [[American Revolutionary War]] when France, the [[Dutch Republic]] and Spain joined forces against Britain and thereafter were blocked from trading with China. The price of tea fell in Canton due to the lack of demand, but went up in Europe where Sweden was now practically the only supplier of tea. This was reflected in the total sum of the profit for the third octroi, which was 58% higher than the previous two.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nThe goods that were exported from Sweden also changed during that period. The former main products such as iron, wood and tar are missing from the freight lists. Instead the biggest item was silver, followed by English lead and Swedish woollen cloth or [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=137}} During the later part of the third charter, it became common practice for one of the supercargoes to stay on permanently in Canton for years. One of those was Jean Abraham Grill, who made ample use of his time there for his own private affairs, a practice that was continued by other resident supercargoes.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=104\u2013105}} [[Carl Linnaeus]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] also made use of the company's ships. They sent out [[Apostles of Linnaeus|scientists and researchers]] to gather information about animals and plants from all the places that the ships visited and to keep detailed journals. The company would not allow idle passengers on board, so most of the scientists were given \"crash courses\" in theology and were hastily ordained to serve as ship's chaplains. These arrangements started during the second charter and peaked during the third.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=137\u2013105<!--check page number-->}}\n\nIn 1758, the Swedes were finally able to let their ships anchor and replenish provisions at the Cape (now known as [[Cape Town]]), a port controlled by the Dutch, due to political changes in Europe. But with the end of the American war in 1783, Sweden lost its advantage in the tea trade and the decline of the company resumed. The SOIC's supercargo in Canton in 1777, [[Finns|Finnish]] Peter Johan Bladh, reflected on this and suggested that an emissary should be sent to the emperor of China with a proposition that the European trade with China should be conducted through one single European company, administrated by Sweden. He stated that unless the British were stopped in time they would infiltrate China the same way they had done in India by \"securing an unbearable domination\" there. The request was never sent since the directors wanted to continue the trade in the same way as before.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=147\u2013150}}\n\nThe mercantile expansion of the SOIC during the third octroi provided a setting for [[Wallenberg family|Jacob Wallenberg]]'s comic ''Min son p\u00e5 galejan'' (\"My Son on{{sic}} the Galley\")<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wallenberg|first1=Jacob|last2=Graves|first2=Peter|title=My son on the galley, translation of the 1769 original: Min son p\u00e5 galejan|date=1994|series=Norvik press series.

The management was the same, a fixed fund existed and some of the fees, taxes and regulations were altered. During this octroi, the company owned 12 ships that were sent out on a total of 31 journeys. Three of the ships were lost and one was damaged and sold. The shareholders received no dividend during the fourth octroi.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=151}}\n\nThe profit from the trade continued to decline, much because of the [[Pitt's India Act|new rules and regulations]] regarding the import of tea to England. Most of the SOIC's earlier tea cargoes had been smuggled to England, but the profit no longer made up for the risk of such an undertaking.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=153}} Talk of shutting down the company started in 1789, and after 1804, no more ships were sent out from Sweden. On 27{{nbsp}}June 1808, the company informed the shareholders of the situation and on 18{{nbsp}}May 1811, the company of the fourth charter was declared bankrupt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=318}}\n\n=== Decline and fall ===\n\nThere was a fifth octroi, starting in 1806 with privileges granted for 15 years, but those were quite different from the previous. Now anyone had the right to trade with the countries on the other side of Cape if the SOIC had not started the trade by launching a ship within two years. With the investors' faith in the trade now broken, no ships were sent out and at a shareholders meeting on 13{{nbsp}}December 1813, the company folded, eight years before the octroi ended. The remaining stock and inventory was sold to foreign buyers and in 1814, the trade was declared free for anyone.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\n== Cargo ==\n[[File:Kinesiskt siden med m\u00e5lat m\u00f6nster, 1700-talet..jpg|thumb|Painted, Chinese silk fabric brought to Sweden by the SOIC, 18th century]]\nThe main valuable cargo from China was tea. In an overview from 1774, its share was about 90%. Much of the tea was re-exported and smuggled into England, undercutting the prices of that country's own trade monopoly held by the [[East India Company]]. Porcelain was also important, accounting for about 5% of the cargo's value. Over the years it is estimated that some 50 million pieces of porcelain were imported by the SOIC. The spirit [[arrack]], a new commodity for Sweden, was also considered valuable.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punsch, A Gift from God (translated) |url=https://naringslivshistoria.se/bizstories-nyheter/naringslivshistoria/punsch-du-gudalika-gava-2/ |website=naringslivshistoria.se |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nA cargo tally, printed by William Milburn in 1813, shows the following.\n{{columns\n| colwidth = 30em\n|col1 =\n'''Chests of tea:'''\n* [[Bohea]], {{convert|1,030,642|lb|kg}} in 2885&nbsp;chests\n* [[Congou]] ({{convert|90,589|lb|kg}})\n* [[Lapsang souchong|Souchong]] ({{convert|67,388|lb|kg}})\n* [[Tea leaf grading|Pekoe]] ({{convert|17,205|lb|kg}})\n* [[Hyson]] and \"Hyson Skin\"{{efn|Definition of Hyson skin varies: \"The light and inferior leaves separated from hyson by a winnowing machine.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hyson skin |editor=Gove Philip Babcock |encyclopedia=Webster's third new international dictionary of the English language, unabridged |year=1993 |url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/11616498 |publisher=K\u00f6nemann |location=Cologne |isbn=3-8290-5292-8 }}</ref>\n ...a superior kind of green tea, of a round, knobby, brightish leaf; but great part of what is imported, is of inferior quality, of a yellowish open leaf, somewhat resembling singlo, and, in consequence, varies greatly in price.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=Robinson Crusoe|url=https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog|year=1815|publisher=Joseph Mawman|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog/page/n426 400]}}</ref>}} (together {{convert|5,713|lb|kg}})\n'''Textiles:'''\n* [[Damask]]s and heavier damasks for furniture\n* [[Satin]] [[silk]], some of it \"coloured and flowered\"\n* [[Paduasoy]]\n* [[Glossary of textile manufacturing#G|Grogram]] also known as ''gorgoron''\n* [[Taffeta]]s,\n* [[Lampas]]\n* [[Nankeen|Nankeen cloth]]\n* 33&nbsp;chests of raw silk\n| col2 =\n'''Drugs:'''\n* [[Galangal|Galangal root]]\n* [[Wolfiporia extensa|China root]]\n* [[Sago]]\n* [[Rhubarb]]\n'''Miscellaneous:'''\n* Mother-of-pearl, some of it cut in thin [[jeton]]s\n* Thin canes for hoops\n* Painted wallpapers\n* Lacquered ([[Japanning|japanned]]) [[Quadrille (card game)|quadrille boxes]]\n* [[Lowboy|Dressing tables]]\n* Tablets for table tops\n* Arrack (used in Swedish [[punsch]]),<ref name=\"spotting\" /> {{convert|6|MT|lb}}\n* Porcelain, in 274&nbsp;chests and 989&nbsp;barrels and other packages\n}}\n\n== Ships ==\n\nThe ships used by the Swedish East India Company.<ref name=NordiskaMuseet>{{cite web|title=Expeditionerna: Kompaniets skepp|trans-title=The Expeditions: The Company's Ships|url=http://ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se/system/exp/exp_skepp.html|website=ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se|publisher=[[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=18 July 2014 |language=Swedish}}</ref>{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=177\u2013184}}\n[[File:Tillaeus karta 1733.jpg|thumb|Map of Stockholm in 1733, by Petrus Tillaeus]]\n[[File:Terra Nova 1733a.jpg|thumb|Close-up of Tillaeus' map showing the Terra Nova wharf, 1733]]\n[[File:Soedermalm 1674.jpg|thumb|Southeast Stockholm in 1674, with the Stora Stads wharf bay in the upper righthand corner.

This design was also used on East India Company ships.]]\nAccording to the first charter, the SOIC's ships were only allowed to use the Swedish merchant flag, a rectangular blue flag with a yellow cross. With the renewal of the charter in 1746, the company was allowed to add its name cypher, or [[monogram]], to the flag in order to distinguish the ships from other trading vessels. Soon after that, the ships of the SOIC started to use a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, used the Swedish [[ensign]] a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead. The swallowtails were even used in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of the ships' [[sloop]]s when they carried a director of the company. This was a double felony, since flags should only be used at the [[stern]] of the sloop.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nThe prohibition did not bother the executives in the SOIC, and the oldest preserved flag in Sweden is a swallowtail from the ship ''Lovisa Ulrica'' (to Canton 1767\u201368). A similar flag, ordered by SOIC director [[Grill (family)#Claes Grill (I)|Claes Grill]], is kept at [[Svindersvik]].<ref>{{cite book |last=S\u00f6derberg|first=Bengt G.|date=1968|title=Slott och herres\u00e4ten i Sverige.

Some of these signals were just for the individual ships and some were used internationally. Sometimes this even included showing flags of other nationalities. Those flags were also used as deception if the ship was where hostile ships could be encountered and the captain wanted to avoid confrontation.

This made Gothenburg a European center of trade in eastern products . The main goods were silk, tea, furniture, porcelain, precious stones and other distinctive luxury items. Trade with China saw the arrival of some new customs in Sweden. The Chinese cultural influence increased, and tea, rice, [[arrack]] and new root vegetables started appearing in Swedish homes.<ref name=spotting>{{cite web |title=East India Company House |url=https://www.spottinghistory.com/view/860/east-india-company-house/ |website=Spotting history |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt grew to become the largest trading company in Sweden during the 18th century, a total of 132 expeditions were carried out with 37 different ships. The company folded in 1813, nevertheless, it left clear footprints that can still be seen in Gothenburg.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Swedish East India Company |url=https://www.soic.se/the-swedish-east-india-company/en |website=www.soic.se |publisher=Svenska Ostindiska Companiet}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\nSweden was the last of the more prominent seafaring European nations to engage in the East India Trade. The royal privileges for the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) were granted almost a century after the other European trading companies were established.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=28}}\n\nWith the advent of the East India trade in the 17th century, Chinese and Indian goods were imported to Sweden. Drinking tea and having Chinese objects became the height of fashion among Swedish socialites and the middle class. Chinese culture, philosophy, art, agriculture, and architecture were also studied and copied. The most prominent example of this is the [[Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm]], which was followed by smaller parks like the one built by [[Jean Abraham Grill]] at [[Grill (family)#Godeg\u00e5rd|Godeg\u00e5rd]]. China was considered a model community, a template for how a country should be governed. This culminated during the 18th century, when many Swedish scientists and politicians even suggested that Sweden should be governed by intellectual bureaucrats, \"[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]]\", led by a sovereign king in a Chinese manner.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|pp=22\u201325}}\n\n=== Early attempts ===\n\nThe first attempt of organizing a Swedish East India trading company was made by a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] merchant, [[Willem Usselincx]].{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=10}} During the 17th century, the Dutch merchants dominated the [[History of Gothenburg|newly founded]] [[Gothenburg]] on the west coast of Sweden. The town was considered ideal for Sweden's international trade since most of the goods were transported on ships and this was the only major Swedish port accessible without having to pass the [[Denmark|Danish]] customs at [[\u00d8resund]].{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=29}} On 14{{nbsp}}June 1626, Usselincx received royal privileges for a trading company for twelve years, from the Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]]. The privileges included clauses about the ethics of trading with foreign, indigenous people. The first priority was to establish friendly, long-term relations that would be mutually beneficiary for both parties. The venture was supported by a number of prominent Swedes, including the King himself, but raising the necessary money proved harder. Political difficulties and Sweden's participation in the [[Thirty Years' War]], where King Gustav II was killed, put an end to the plans. The resources were instead used for a smaller company, trading within Europe.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe next attempt to start a trading company was made in 1661, by German merchant Erlenkamp, who suggested a route over the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Northern Sea Route]], past [[Japan]] and further on to [[China]] and [[India]]. The aim was to bypass the Spanish and Portuguese blockades.  The plan did not gain any support as the ice barriers proved even more difficult.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=11}} At the end of the 1660s, a petition from diplomat and London resident Johan Leijonbergh was sent to the Swedish King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] regarding one Olle Borg who had worked in the [[Dutch East India Company]] for eighteen years. Borg stated that if there was a war between Sweden and Denmark, he could deliver the Danish fort in [[Tharangambadi]], India, to the Swedes. Knut Kurck, Peter Schnack and Johan Olivecreutz were appointed directors for the company, but the political unrest in Sweden at that time plus trouble with actually getting the money that had been promised from the investors thwarted this venture as well, and in 1674, the charter was dissolved. Residual resources were used to send two ships, the ''Solen'' (the Sun) and the ''Trumslagaren'' (the Drummer), to [[Lisbon]] for salt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=35\u201337}}\n\nA later attempt to establish the Swedish trade on the East Indies was made by pirates sailing out from [[Madagascar]]. After having attacked other trading ships, they had become wealthy and were looking for a place to settle down and invest their money in legitimate enterprise. The pirates numbered about 1,500 and commanded a considerable and well-armed fleet of ships. They started by offering the Swedish King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] half a million pounds sterling and 25 armed ships for his protection, but the matter was not resolved. In 1718, representatives for the pirates met again with the King at his camp during the [[Siege of Fredriksten|campaign against Norway]]. The new offer was for 60 ships, armed and stocked with goods, if the pirates were allowed to settle down in Gothenburg and start a trade with the East Indies under the Swedish flag. One privateer by the name of Morgan actually obtained a charter for an East India Company and a letter of appointment for himself as governor over the colonies that could be the result of such an enterprise. When the King was shot and died on 30{{nbsp}}November 1718, the venture folded.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=37}}\n\n=== Sweden after the Great Northern War ===\n\n[[File:Sockersk\u00e5l GM 7012.jpg|thumb|upright|Porcelain sugar bowl made in China c. 1770\u201390, imported by the SOIC, City Museum of Gothenburg]]\nSweden was impoverished after the [[Great Northern War]], and trade was seen as an option for rebuilding the country. Opinions about whether trade with the East Indies would be profitable enough diverged.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=12}} The greatest concern was that Sweden would not have enough resources to defend the company's ships and [[trading post]]s. The trading companies from [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] did not hesitate to attack other ships to prevent competition. A failed attempt to start a competing trade company in [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], the [[Ostend Company]], was discouraging.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nWhat finally made the Swedish venture possible was the strong support from foreign traders and merchants, foremost British but also Dutch, who had been shut out from the companies in their respective countries. The majority of the investors, as well as the buyers of the goods imported by the company, were foreigners.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nGranting permission for a charter was not entirely uncontroversial during that time when [[mercantilism]], which advocated regulations so that the production of export goods was promoted and import reduced, was the dominant idea for trade. Opposition became even more apparent after the first journey made by the ship ''Friedericus Rex Sueciaes'' in 1735.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=46}} Demands were made in the [[Riksdag]] for sanctions and restrictions for the trade company, a number of [[pamphlet]]s were written, arguing that Swedish steel and timber were wastefully being exchanged for such  \"worthless goods\" as tea and [[Canton porcelain|porcelain]].{{efn|Contemporary arguments pro and con concerning the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) are examined in the last chapter of Christian Koninckx.{{sfn|Koninckx|1980}}}} One of the most ardent critics against the charter was Johan Arckenholtz. He even spoke of the moral aspects, saying that the Swedish population \"would be weaned from work and crafts and lose their health, strength and spirit by using products from a warmer climate\".{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nThe emerging Swedish textile industry was also threatened by the trade, and the new company soon promised to refrain from shipping textiles. Of sixty-one successfully returning voyages between 1733 and 1767, only three (in 1735, 1740, and 1742) carried cotton and silk textiles and raw silk from [[Bengal]].{{efn|Koninckx, quoted in \"The European Trading Companies\".{{sfn|Johnson|Prakash|1998|p=80}}}} Some opposition may have been rooted in pure jealousy of the profits the SOIC were making from the trade.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|pp=43\u201345}} Those who supported the establishing of a Swedish trade company argued that if people wanted goods from China, they were going to buy them anyway and it would be better to import them using Swedish ships and trading company, and thereby keep the profits within Sweden.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=28}}\n\n== Establishing the SOIC ==\n[[File:Portrait of Colin Campbell 1756 - cropped.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Colin Campbell (Swedish East India Company)|Colin Campbell]] (1686\u20131757), co-founder and director of the SOIC]]\n[[File:Niclas Sahlgren oil painting - cropped.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Niclas Sahlgren]] (1701\u20131776), co-founder and director of the SOIC]]\n[[File:Henrik K\u00f6nig (1676- ) of the Swedish East India Company.jpg|thumb|160px|Henrik K\u00f6nig (1686\u20131736), co-founder and director of the SOIC]]\nWith the suspension of the charter for the Ostend company by the Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in May 1727, the investors in that company had to look for other ways to be part of the profitable East India trade and they now looked to Sweden.<ref name=Nordisk>{{cite encyclopedia | title =Ostindiska kompanier|trans-title=East India companies | encyclopedia =[[Nordisk familjebok]]\u2013Uggleupplagan | editor=Leche, V |editor2=Nystr\u00f6m, J.F. |editor3=Warburg, K |editor4=Westrin, Th | year =1914 |volume=20| publisher =Nordisk familjeboks f\u00f6rl. | url=http://runeberg.org/nfbt/0570.html | pp=1060\u20131062 | location =Stockholm | language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nScottish merchant [[Colin Campbell (Swedish East India Company)|Colin Campbell]], formerly active in the Ostend Company, met with Swedish [[Niclas Sahlgren]] during Sahlgren's stay in Amsterdam in the late 1720s. Together they made plans for a Swedish trading company, but it was evident that Campbell was the driving force in the enterprise. Since foreign investors were met with suspicion in Sweden, they needed a respectable Swede to front the company.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=20}} That person would be commissioner Henrik K\u00f6nig, a Swede of German ([[Bremen]]) origin.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=30}}\n\nIn 1729, Henrik K\u00f6nig submitted an application for a charter for two ships. He supported his request on the charter given previously to other applicants, but the reaction from the Swedish government was reluctant: the closing of the Ostend Company in 1731, following British pressure as part of the [[Treaty of Vienna (1731)|Treaty of Vienna]], boded ill for the Swedes' competition against the main powers when trade and politics were so intimately associated. K\u00f6nig took the matters to the Swedish parliament and succeeded, gaining royal privileges for the company on 14{{nbsp}}June 1731, initially for a period of 15 years.{{efn|The reappearance of some Antwerp bankers who had been members of the Ostend Company, as investors in the Swedish East India Company misled some historians in viewing the SOIC as a type of front for continuing the Ostend Company; this misperception was put to rest by Koninckx.{{sfn|Koninckx|1980}}}}{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=38\u201339}} These privileges were the First Charter, or the First [[Octroi]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=43}}\n\n=== The Royal charter ===\n\nThe charter was given to Henrik K\u00f6nig & Compagnie and consisted of eighteen precise paragraphs on how the trade should be conducted:{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=39\u201342}}\n\n#The company would have the right to all trade and shipping east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] as far as [[Japan]] excepting the port [[Factory (trading post)|factories]] of other European nations, unless free consent had been obtained in advance.\n#All departures and arrivals should be out of Gothenburg, and cargo was to be auctioned promptly in Gothenburg on arrival.\n#The Swedish state was to receive 100 [[Swedish riksdaler|riksdaler]] per ''l\u00e4st'' (c. 2.5 tonnes){{efn|A \"l\u00e4st\" was a unit to describe a ships [[tonnage]].

These suspicions were well founded. All of the initiators of the SOIC were non-swedes or of foreign origin. Swedish law made it possible for anyone who invested in the company to receive Swedish citizenship and most of the crew aboard the ships during the first and the second octroi were foreigners. Of the 53 supercargoes during the first octroi,{{efn|The list on pages 177\u201378 in Kjellberg has 53 names of supercargoes in the first octroi, but in the summary it is stated that \"... there were 40 foreign against 11 Swedish supercargoes.\" during the first octroi.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=316}}}} about 22 percent were [[Swedes]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=124}}\n\n==== The first expedition ====\n\n[[File:AMH-4769-KB Residence of the governor general within the walls of the castle at Batavia.jpg|thumb|Residence of the governor general and the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] buildings in Batavia]]\nThe first expedition was organized by Campbell. His reconstructed diary of the voyage, rediscovered in 1986, contain a complete account of the expedition.{{efn|Campbell had destroyed his diary when the ship was taken by the Dutch and reconstructed it from memory and some loose papers; it was translated and published by Paul Hallberg and Christian Koninckx.{{sfn|Campbell|Hallberg|Koninckx|1996}}}} It started on 9{{nbsp}}February 1732, as the ship ''Friedericus Rex Sueciae'' sailed out from Gothenburg. Campbell was the first supercargo onboard and had also been appointed ambassador to the Chinese court by the King. The other three supercargos were English: Charles Graham, Charles Morford and John Pike. The captain of the ''Fredericus'' was Georg Herman af Trolle, a seasoned sailor who had been brought up in Amsterdam and previously served on English, French, Dutch and Danish ships. He had also been employed as a [[privateer]] by the town of [[Middelburg]]. Both he and Campbell had previously visited China. The crew for the ship was approximately one hundred men.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nThe expedition started well\u2014passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and crossing the [[Indian Ocean]], the vessel arrived safely in Canton (now known as [[Guangzhou]]), the trading port for foreigners in China at that time, in September 1732. For the next four months, trading was carried out successfully. Initially, different spices were the primary commodity along with tea, silk and miscellaneous luxury items, but on later voyages, porcelain and tea made up the bulk of the trade to meet the demand for such goods back in Europe.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=44\u201346}}\n\nOn its return, the vessel was stopped by the Dutch between [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]], and brought to [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]]. Campbell protested and produced his papers, but the Dutch argued that they had suspected the vessel of falsely flying the Swedish flag.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=44}} The expedition was eventually released,{{efn|\"Since which period the Swedish East India Company have been suffered to carry on their trade without the least interruption, but which is solely confined to China,\" Milburn in summary of the Swedish East India Company.{{sfn|Milburn|1813|pp=576\u201378}}}} but time was lost and the winds unfavourable. Many of the seamen died en route and the ship had to recruit new Norwegian sailors upon reaching the coast of Norway.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=42}}\n\nAlmost one and a half years after the departure, the vessel returned to Gothenburg on 27{{nbsp}}August 1733. The expedition was a huge economic success, the auction bringing in some 900,000 Swedish riksdaler. The dividend paid was 75% of the capital invested. According to the ledgers of the Gothenburg Main Customs Cambers for Sea Trade in 1733 to 1734, goods for 518,972 riksdaler were exported; the rest stayed in Sweden.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=45}}\n\n=== The second octroi (1746\u20131766) ===\n\n[[File:Canton Thirteen Factories map 1748-49 enhanced with translations.jpg|thumb|The riverside part of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] by Johan Fredrik Dalman, 1748\u201349]]\nThe charter was renewed in 1746, 1766 and 1786, creating the Second, Third and Fourth Octrois.{{sfn|Milburn|1813|p=577}}{{sfn|Koninckx|1980}}\n\nUnder the terms of the second charter 36 ships were sent out, three to [[Surat]], the rest to Canton, and only one was lost.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=314}}\n\nThe profit for the shareholders during the first charter generated large interest for a second charter. Except for the foreign investors, most of the merchants during the first charter had been from Gothenburg. With the second charter, a number of merchants from Stockholm started to show interest in the trade. On 23{{nbsp}}September 1745, a request for a second octroi was presented by the firm ''Abraham and Jacob Arfwedsson & Co''. They received a preliminary grant for it. A couple of weeks later, a second request for an octroi was made by the company ''Anders Plomgren & C:o'' and partner Carl Broman. The directors from the first charter submitted their request on 20{{nbsp}}January 1746.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=69\u201371}}\n\nA commission to investigate the applications was appointed on 24{{nbsp}}March 1746, and some weeks later on 14{{nbsp}}May, they concluded that the directors from the first charter were best suited to lead the second as well.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=71}} However, the number of directors was increased from three to at least seven. In addition to Colin Campbell, Niclas Sahlgren and Teodor Ankarcrona, the directors were former secretary of the Executive Board Magnus Lagerstr\u00f6m, the Stockholm merchants Anders Plomgren and [[Grill family#Abraham Grill (II) the Younger|Abraham Grill]]. These six members of the board later elected [[Claes Grill]], Jacob von Utfall Jeanson, S. N. Wenngren and Nils Str\u00f6m as directors.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=73}}\n\nThe second charter was for 20 years and the directors followed the ways of the first octroi. They collected the means from the investors to fund each of the first 14 ships separately. In 1753, the company was reorganized into a joint-stock company by creating a fixed fund where anyone could subscribe for shares, but not for less than 500 riksdaler in silver.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nEven after the company went public, it still retained its secrecy regarding the business. The management deliberately withheld information from the shareholders or lied about how profitable parts of the business were. The directors said that the profit from the trade with China was declining and that the company should be granted permission to send a ship to India, contrary to the regulations for the trade so far. An exemption was granted in 1749, and a ship was sent to Surat in India. On its return in 1752, that ship yielded a profit of 103% and two more ships were sent to Surat. The English and the Dutch controlled most of the trade in the town and did everything to prevent the Swedes from doing business there and several incidents occurred. The company decided to refocus in the China trade instead. That trade yielded an average profit of 30\u201340% during the second charter.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=314\u2013316}}\n\n=== The third octroi (1766\u20131786) ===\n\n[[File:Hongs at Canton.jpg|thumb|right|Canton [[Thirteen Factories]], with flags of Denmark, Spain, the U.S., Sweden, Britain, and the Netherlands, c. 1820]]\nWhen it was time to renew the charter in 1766, the first directors were Robert Finlay of Irish and Scottish origin,  Swedish Fabian L\u00f6wen and Georg Herman Conradi of German descent, all residing in Stockholm. With this the power within the management shifted from Gothenburg to Stockholm, where two new ships also were bought.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=131\u2013133}} The Swedish government extorted a loan at 6% interest to the SOIC to be paid during 1766\u201369, estimated in 1813 to have been the equivalent of \u00a3100,000, and another, interest-free, for half of that sum, to be repaid out of import duties,{{sfn|Milburn|1813|p=577}} in essence an advance payment of duty.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=317}}\n\nDuring the third charter, 39 voyages were made to Canton and none of the ships was lost or damaged, but the profit from the trade with China was declining. The turning point for Sweden came in 1780, with the [[American Revolutionary War]] when France, the [[Dutch Republic]] and Spain joined forces against Britain and thereafter were blocked from trading with China. The price of tea fell in Canton due to the lack of demand, but went up in Europe where Sweden was now practically the only supplier of tea. This was reflected in the total sum of the profit for the third octroi, which was 58% higher than the previous two.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nThe goods that were exported from Sweden also changed during that period. The former main products such as iron, wood and tar are missing from the freight lists. Instead the biggest item was silver, followed by English lead and Swedish woollen cloth or [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=137}} During the later part of the third charter, it became common practice for one of the supercargoes to stay on permanently in Canton for years. One of those was Jean Abraham Grill, who made ample use of his time there for his own private affairs, a practice that was continued by other resident supercargoes.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=104\u2013105}} [[Carl Linnaeus]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] also made use of the company's ships. They sent out [[Apostles of Linnaeus|scientists and researchers]] to gather information about animals and plants from all the places that the ships visited and to keep detailed journals. The company would not allow idle passengers on board, so most of the scientists were given \"crash courses\" in theology and were hastily ordained to serve as ship's chaplains. These arrangements started during the second charter and peaked during the third.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=137\u2013105<!--check page number-->}}\n\nIn 1758, the Swedes were finally able to let their ships anchor and replenish provisions at the Cape (now known as [[Cape Town]]), a port controlled by the Dutch, due to political changes in Europe. But with the end of the American war in 1783, Sweden lost its advantage in the tea trade and the decline of the company resumed. The SOIC's supercargo in Canton in 1777, [[Finns|Finnish]] Peter Johan Bladh, reflected on this and suggested that an emissary should be sent to the emperor of China with a proposition that the European trade with China should be conducted through one single European company, administrated by Sweden. He stated that unless the British were stopped in time they would infiltrate China the same way they had done in India by \"securing an unbearable domination\" there. The request was never sent since the directors wanted to continue the trade in the same way as before.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=147\u2013150}}\n\nThe mercantile expansion of the SOIC during the third octroi provided a setting for [[Wallenberg family|Jacob Wallenberg]]'s comic ''Min son p\u00e5 galejan'' (\"My Son on{{sic}} the Galley\")<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wallenberg|first1=Jacob|last2=Graves|first2=Peter|title=My son on the galley, translation of the 1769 original: Min son p\u00e5 galejan|date=1994|series=Norvik press series.

The management was the same, a fixed fund existed and some of the fees, taxes and regulations were altered. During this octroi, the company owned 12 ships that were sent out on a total of 31 journeys. Three of the ships were lost and one was damaged and sold. The shareholders received no dividend during the fourth octroi.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=151}}\n\nThe profit from the trade continued to decline, much because of the [[Pitt's India Act|new rules and regulations]] regarding the import of tea to England. Most of the SOIC's earlier tea cargoes had been smuggled to England, but the profit no longer made up for the risk of such an undertaking.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=153}} Talk of shutting down the company started in 1789, and after 1804, no more ships were sent out from Sweden. On 27{{nbsp}}June 1808, the company informed the shareholders of the situation and on 18{{nbsp}}May 1811, the company of the fourth charter was declared bankrupt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=318}}\n\n=== Decline and fall ===\n\nThere was a fifth octroi, starting in 1806 with privileges granted for 15 years, but those were quite different from the previous. Now anyone had the right to trade with the countries on the other side of Cape if the SOIC had not started the trade by launching a ship within two years. With the investors' faith in the trade now broken, no ships were sent out and at a shareholders meeting on 13{{nbsp}}December 1813, the company folded, eight years before the octroi ended. The remaining stock and inventory was sold to foreign buyers and in 1814, the trade was declared free for anyone.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\n== Cargo ==\n[[File:Kinesiskt siden med m\u00e5lat m\u00f6nster, 1700-talet..jpg|thumb|Painted, Chinese silk fabric brought to Sweden by the SOIC, 18th century]]\nThe main valuable cargo from China was tea. In an overview from 1774, its share was about 90%. Much of the tea was re-exported and smuggled into England, undercutting the prices of that country's own trade monopoly held by the [[East India Company]]. Porcelain was also important, accounting for about 5% of the cargo's value. Over the years it is estimated that some 50 million pieces of porcelain were imported by the SOIC. The spirit [[arrack]], a new commodity for Sweden, was also considered valuable.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punsch, A Gift from God (translated) |url=https://naringslivshistoria.se/bizstories-nyheter/naringslivshistoria/punsch-du-gudalika-gava-2/ |website=naringslivshistoria.se |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nA cargo tally, printed by William Milburn in 1813, shows the following.\n{{columns\n| colwidth = 30em\n|col1 =\n'''Chests of tea:'''\n* [[Bohea]], {{convert|1,030,642|lb|kg}} in 2885&nbsp;chests\n* [[Congou]] ({{convert|90,589|lb|kg}})\n* [[Lapsang souchong|Souchong]] ({{convert|67,388|lb|kg}})\n* [[Tea leaf grading|Pekoe]] ({{convert|17,205|lb|kg}})\n* [[Hyson]] and \"Hyson Skin\"{{efn|Definition of Hyson skin varies: \"The light and inferior leaves separated from hyson by a winnowing machine.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hyson skin |editor=Gove Philip Babcock |encyclopedia=Webster's third new international dictionary of the English language, unabridged |year=1993 |url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/11616498 |publisher=K\u00f6nemann |location=Cologne |isbn=3-8290-5292-8 }}</ref>\n ...a superior kind of green tea, of a round, knobby, brightish leaf; but great part of what is imported, is of inferior quality, of a yellowish open leaf, somewhat resembling singlo, and, in consequence, varies greatly in price.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=Robinson Crusoe|url=https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog|year=1815|publisher=Joseph Mawman|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog/page/n426 400]}}</ref>}} (together {{convert|5,713|lb|kg}})\n'''Textiles:'''\n* [[Damask]]s and heavier damasks for furniture\n* [[Satin]] [[silk]], some of it \"coloured and flowered\"\n* [[Paduasoy]]\n* [[Glossary of textile manufacturing#G|Grogram]] also known as ''gorgoron''\n* [[Taffeta]]s,\n* [[Lampas]]\n* [[Nankeen|Nankeen cloth]]\n* 33&nbsp;chests of raw silk\n| col2 =\n'''Drugs:'''\n* [[Galangal|Galangal root]]\n* [[Wolfiporia extensa|China root]]\n* [[Sago]]\n* [[Rhubarb]]\n'''Miscellaneous:'''\n* Mother-of-pearl, some of it cut in thin [[jeton]]s\n* Thin canes for hoops\n* Painted wallpapers\n* Lacquered ([[Japanning|japanned]]) [[Quadrille (card game)|quadrille boxes]]\n* [[Lowboy|Dressing tables]]\n* Tablets for table tops\n* Arrack (used in Swedish [[punsch]]),<ref name=\"spotting\" /> {{convert|6|MT|lb}}\n* Porcelain, in 274&nbsp;chests and 989&nbsp;barrels and other packages\n}}\n\n== Ships ==\n\nThe ships used by the Swedish East India Company.<ref name=NordiskaMuseet>{{cite web|title=Expeditionerna: Kompaniets skepp|trans-title=The Expeditions: The Company's Ships|url=http://ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se/system/exp/exp_skepp.html|website=ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se|publisher=[[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=18 July 2014 |language=Swedish}}</ref>{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=177\u2013184}}\n[[File:Tillaeus karta 1733.jpg|thumb|Map of Stockholm in 1733, by Petrus Tillaeus]]\n[[File:Terra Nova 1733a.jpg|thumb|Close-up of Tillaeus' map showing the Terra Nova wharf, 1733]]\n[[File:Soedermalm 1674.jpg|thumb|Southeast Stockholm in 1674, with the Stora Stads wharf bay in the upper righthand corner.

This design was also used on East India Company ships.]]\nAccording to the first charter, the SOIC's ships were only allowed to use the Swedish merchant flag, a rectangular blue flag with a yellow cross. With the renewal of the charter in 1746, the company was allowed to add its name cypher, or [[monogram]], to the flag in order to distinguish the ships from other trading vessels. Soon after that, the ships of the SOIC started to use a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, used the Swedish [[ensign]] a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead. The swallowtails were even used in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of the ships' [[sloop]]s when they carried a director of the company. This was a double felony, since flags should only be used at the [[stern]] of the sloop.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nThe prohibition did not bother the executives in the SOIC, and the oldest preserved flag in Sweden is a swallowtail from the ship ''Lovisa Ulrica'' (to Canton 1767\u201368). A similar flag, ordered by SOIC director [[Grill (family)#Claes Grill (I)|Claes Grill]], is kept at [[Svindersvik]].<ref>{{cite book |last=S\u00f6derberg|first=Bengt G.|date=1968|title=Slott och herres\u00e4ten i Sverige.

Some of these signals were just for the individual ships and some were used internationally. Sometimes this even included showing flags of other nationalities. Those flags were also used as deception if the ship was where hostile ships could be encountered and the captain wanted to avoid confrontation.

After gaining popularity, the single was re-released by [[Columbia Records]] in March 2019. Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which was released on April 5, 2019. Both the original and remix were included on Lil Nas X's debut EP, ''[[7 (Lil Nas X EP)|7]]'' (2019).\n\nThe song has been widely labeled as \"[[country rap]]\", a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. Dutch record producer [[YoungKio]] produced the instrumental and made it available for purchase online in 2018. It features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of a [[banjo]] from \"[[Ghosts I\u2013IV|34 Ghosts IV]]\" by American industrial rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The sample was placed behind [[Trap music|trap]]-style [[Roland TR-808]] drums and bass. Lil Nas X purchased the instrumental for US$30 and recorded \"Old Town Road\" in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real world struggles served as an influence on some of the lyrics.\n\nThe song initially gained popularity on social video sharing app [[TikTok]] and eventually entered the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in March 2019. The song reached number 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Country Songs]] chart before the magazine disqualified it from being included on the chart on grounds that it did not fit the genre, sparking a debate on the definition of [[country music]]. Though it was not re-entered onto the overall country charts, both the original version of the song and the remix featuring Cyrus eventually peaked at number one on the flagship ''Billboard'' chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], for a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100|record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks]]. Internationally, one or more versions of \"Old Town Road\" have topped the national singles charts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; and charted within the top 10 in various other markets. \n\nThe song was awarded [[Recording Industry Association of America#\"Digital\" single certification|diamond certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], in October 2019, for moving ten million total units in the United States, the fastest song to be awarded diamond certification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/lil-nas-x-takes-the-old-town-road-to-diamond-status-be-1839292040|title=Lil Nas X Takes the 'Old Town Road' to Diamond Status, Becomes Fastest Song Ever to Do So|last=|first=|date=|website=The Root|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> The remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and won for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[File:Lil Nas X (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Lil Nas X (pictured) bought the beat for \"Old Town Road\" anonymously on an online store from producer YoungKio for $30.<ref name=\"BI\"/>]]\n[[Country rap]], and its subgenre, country trap, emerged onto the mainstream following American rapper [[Young Thug]]'s experimental mixtape ''[[Beautiful Thugger Girls]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"ThugSlime\"/> Lil Nas X has cited Young Thug as a pioneer of country trap.<ref name=\"TIME\"/> In May 2018, [[Lil Tracy]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]] reignited the trend with their country rap single \"Like a Farmer (Remix)\".<ref name=\"ThugSlime\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8503019/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-five-things-to-know|title=5 Things to Know About 'Old Town Road' Rapper Lil Nas X|work=Billboard|author=Michael Saponara|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/27/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billboard-country-chart-removal|title=Billboard erases Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' from country music chart|website=[[The Fader]]|author=Salvatore Maicki|date=March 27, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019|quote=Lil Nas X's hit is one of the latest entries in a storied canon of country rap, a trend reignited last year by Lil Tracy and Lil Uzi Vert's \"Like a Farmer.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue a music career, but was discouraged by his parents.

December 2018. After gaining popularity, the single was re-released by [[Columbia Records]] in March 2019. Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which was released on April 5, 2019. Both the original and remix were included on Lil Nas X's debut EP, ''[[7 (Lil Nas X EP)|7]]'' (2019).\n\nThe song has been widely labeled as \"[[country rap]]\", a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. Dutch record producer [[YoungKio]] produced the instrumental and made it available for purchase online in 2018. It features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of a [[banjo]] from \"[[Ghosts I\u2013IV|34 Ghosts IV]]\" by American industrial rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The sample was placed behind [[Trap music|trap]]-style [[Roland TR-808]] drums and bass. Lil Nas X purchased the instrumental for US$30 and recorded \"Old Town Road\" in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real world struggles served as an influence on some of the lyrics.\n\nThe song initially gained popularity on social video sharing app [[TikTok]] and eventually entered the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in March 2019. The song reached number 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Country Songs]] chart before the magazine disqualified it from being included on the chart on grounds that it did not fit the genre, sparking a debate on the definition of [[country music]]. Though it was not re-entered onto the overall country charts, both the original version of the song and the remix featuring Cyrus eventually peaked at number one on the flagship ''Billboard'' chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], for a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100|record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks]]. Internationally, one or more versions of \"Old Town Road\" have topped the national singles charts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; and charted within the top 10 in various other markets. \n\nThe song was awarded [[Recording Industry Association of America#\"Digital\" single certification|diamond certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], in October 2019, for moving ten million total units in the United States, the fastest song to be awarded diamond certification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/lil-nas-x-takes-the-old-town-road-to-diamond-status-be-1839292040|title=Lil Nas X Takes the 'Old Town Road' to Diamond Status, Becomes Fastest Song Ever to Do So|last=|first=|date=|website=The Root|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> The remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and won for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[File:Lil Nas X (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Lil Nas X (pictured) bought the beat for \"Old Town Road\" anonymously on an online store from producer YoungKio for $30.<ref name=\"BI\"/>]]\n[[Country rap]], and its subgenre, country trap, emerged onto the mainstream following American rapper [[Young Thug]]'s experimental mixtape ''[[Beautiful Thugger Girls]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"ThugSlime\"/> Lil Nas X has cited Young Thug as a pioneer of country trap.<ref name=\"TIME\"/> In May 2018, [[Lil Tracy]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]] reignited the trend with their country rap single \"Like a Farmer (Remix)\".<ref name=\"ThugSlime\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8503019/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-five-things-to-know|title=5 Things to Know About 'Old Town Road' Rapper Lil Nas X|work=Billboard|author=Michael Saponara|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/27/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billboard-country-chart-removal|title=Billboard erases Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' from country music chart|website=[[The Fader]]|author=Salvatore Maicki|date=March 27, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019|quote=Lil Nas X's hit is one of the latest entries in a storied canon of country rap, a trend reignited last year by Lil Tracy and Lil Uzi Vert's \"Like a Farmer.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue a music career, but was discouraged by his parents.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].
