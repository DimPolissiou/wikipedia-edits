O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref> He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed. In the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt.

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, described as the greatest realm of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] in the west of [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[Third Age]]. The third volume of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', is largely concerned with the events in Gondor during the [[War of the Ring]] and with the restoration of the realm afterward. The history of the kingdom is outlined in the appendices of the book.\n\nAccording to the narrative, Gondor was founded by the brothers [[Isildur]] and An\u00e1rion, exiles from the downfallen island kingdom of [[N\u00famenor]]. Along with Arnor in the north, Gondor, the South-kingdom, served as a last stronghold of the [[D\u00fanedain|Men of the West]]. After an early period of growth, Gondor gradually declined as the Third Age progressed, being continually weakened by internal strife and conflict with the allies of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. The kingdom's ascendancy was restored only with Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of [[Aragorn]].\n\nBased upon early conceptions, the history and geography of Gondor were developed in stages as Tolkien extended [[Tolkien's legendarium|his legendarium]] while writing of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Critics have noted the contrast between the cultured but lifeless Stewards of Gondor, and the simple but vigorous leaders of the Kingdom of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], modelled on Tolkien's favoured [[Anglo-Saxons]]. Scholars have noted parallels between Gondor and the [[Normans]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Vikings]], the [[Goths]], the [[Langobards]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Fictional etymology===\n\nTolkien intended the name ''Gondor'' to be [[Sindarin]] for \"land of stone\".<ref name=\"AppF\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=Appendix F, \"Of Men\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref><ref name=\"Etym\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Etymologies|loc=entries GOND-, NDOR-|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1987}}}}</ref> This is echoed in the text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by the name for Gondor among the [[Rohirrim]], Stoningland.<ref name=\"RK-BPF\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=book 5 ch. 6 \"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref> Tolkien's early writings suggest that this was a reference to the highly developed masonry of Gondorians in contrast to their rustic neighbours.<ref name=\"RS379-81\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the Shadow|loc=ch. 22 \"New Uncertainties and New Projections\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1988}}}}</ref> This view is supported by the [[Dr\u00faedain]] terms for Gondorians and [[Minas Tirith]]\u2014Stonehouse-folk and Stone-city.<ref name=\"RK-RR\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=book 5 ch. 5 \"The Ride of the Rohirrim\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref> Tolkien denied that the name ''Gondor'' had been inspired by the ancient Ethiopian citadel of [[Gondar]], stating that the root ''Ond'' went back to an account he had read as a child mentioning ''ond'' (\"stone\") as one of only two words known of the [[pre-Celtic]] languages of Britain.<ref group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=#324}}</ref> Gondor is also called the South-kingdom or Southern Realm, and together with Arnor as the N\u00famen\u00f3rean Realms in Exile.

He notes that men from the two countries meet or behave in contrasting ways several times in ''The Lord of the Rings'': when \u00c9omer and his Riders of Rohan twice meet Aragorn's party in the Mark, and when Faramir and his men imprison Frodo and Sam at Henneth Annun in Ithilien. Shippey notes that while \u00c9omer is \"compulsively truculent\", Faramir is courteous, urbane, civilised: the people of Gondor are self-assured, and their culture is higher than that of Rohan. The same is seen, Shippey argues, in the comparison between the [[mead hall]] of [[Meduseld]] in Rohan, and the great hall of Minas Tirith in Gondor. Meduseld is simple, but brought to life by tapestries, a colourful stone floor, and the vivid picture of the rider, his bright hair streaming in the wind, blowing his horn. The Steward Denethor's hall is large and solemn, but dead, colourless, in cold stone. Rohan is, Shippey suggests, the \"bit that Tolkien knew best\",{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=146-149}} Anglo-Saxon, full of vigour; Gondor is \"a kind of Rome\", over-subtle, selfish, calculating.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=146-149}}\n\nThe critic [[Jane Chance Nitzsche]] contrasts the \"good and bad Germanic lords [[Th\u00e9oden]] and Denethor\", noting that their names are almost anagrams. She writes that both men receive the allegiance of a hobbit, but very differently: Denethor, Steward of Gondor, undervalues [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] because he is small, and binds him with a formal oath, whereas Th\u00e9oden, King of Rohan, treats [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] with love, which the hobbit responds to.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|pp=119-122}}\n\n==Influences==\n\nThe scholar of Germanic studies Sandra Ballif Straubhaar notes in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' that readers have debated the real-world prototypes of Gondor. She writes that like the [[Normans]], their founders the Numenoreans arrived \"from across the sea\", and that Prince Imrahil's armour with a \"burnished [[vambrace]]\" recalls late-medieval [[plate armour]]. Against this theory, she notes Tolkien's direction of readers to Egypt and Byzantium.<!--''Letters'', #?--> Recalling that Tolkien located Minas Tirith at the latitude of Florence, she states that \"the most striking similarities\" are with [[ancient Rome]]. She identifies several parallels: [[Aeneas]], from [[Troy]], and Elendil, from Numenor, both survive the destruction of their home countries; the brothers [[Romulus and Remus]] found Rome, while the brothers Isildur and An\u00e1rion found the Numenorean kingdoms in Middle-earth; and both Gondor and Rome experienced centuries of \"[[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|decadence and decline]]\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2007|pp=248-249}} \n\nThe scholar of fantasy and children's literature Dimitra Fimi<!--U. of Glasgow--> draws a parallel between the seafaring Numenoreans and the [[Vikings]] of the Norse world, noting that in ''The Lost Road and Other Writings'', Tolkien describes their [[ship-burial]]s,<ref group=T>{{Harvnb|The Lost Road and Other Writings|loc=ch. 2 \"The Fall of Numenor\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1987}}}}</ref> matching those in ''[[Beowulf]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]''.{{sfn|Fimi|2007|pages=84-99}} She notes that Boromir is given a boat-funeral in ''The Two Towers''.<ref group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Two Towers|loc=book 3, ch. 1 \"The Departure of Boromir\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1954}}}}</ref>{{sfn|Fimi|2007|pages=84-99}} Fimi further compares the helmet and crown of Gondor with the romanticised \"headgear of the [[Valkyries]]\", despite Tolkien's denial of a connection with [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle]], noting the \"likeness of the wings of a sea-bird\"<ref group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=book 6, ch. 5 \"The Steward and the King\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref> in his description of Aragorn's coronation, and his drawing of the crown in an unused dust jacket design.<ref group=T>''The Winged Crown of Gondor''.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, described as the greatest realm of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] in the west of [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[Third Age]]. The third volume of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', is largely concerned with the events in Gondor during the [[War of the Ring]] and with the restoration of the realm afterward. The history of the kingdom is outlined in the appendices of the book.\n\nAccording to the narrative, Gondor was founded by the brothers [[Isildur]] and An\u00e1rion, exiles from the downfallen island kingdom of [[N\u00famenor]]. Along with Arnor in the north, Gondor, the South-kingdom, served as a last stronghold of the [[D\u00fanedain|Men of the West]]. After an early period of growth, Gondor gradually declined as the Third Age progressed, being continually weakened by internal strife and conflict with the allies of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. The kingdom's ascendancy was restored only with Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of [[Aragorn]].\n\nBased upon early conceptions, the history and geography of Gondor were developed in stages as Tolkien extended [[Tolkien's legendarium|his legendarium]] while writing of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Critics have noted the contrast between the cultured but lifeless Stewards of Gondor, and the simple but vigorous leaders of the Kingdom of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], modelled on Tolkien's favoured [[Anglo-Saxons]]. Scholars have noted parallels between Gondor and the [[Normans]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Vikings]], the [[Goths]], the [[Langobards]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Fictional etymology===\n\nTolkien intended the name ''Gondor'' to be [[Sindarin]] for \"land of stone\".<ref name=\"AppF\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=Appendix F, \"Of Men\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref><ref name=\"Etym\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Etymologies|loc=entries GOND-, NDOR-|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1987}}}}</ref> This is echoed in the text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by the name for Gondor among the [[Rohirrim]], Stoningland.<ref name=\"RK-BPF\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=book 5 ch. 6 \"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref> Tolkien's early writings suggest that this was a reference to the highly developed masonry of Gondorians in contrast to their rustic neighbours.<ref name=\"RS379-81\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the Shadow|loc=ch. 22 \"New Uncertainties and New Projections\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1988}}}}</ref> This view is supported by the [[Dr\u00faedain]] terms for Gondorians and [[Minas Tirith]]\u2014Stonehouse-folk and Stone-city.<ref name=\"RK-RR\" group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=book 5 ch. 5 \"The Ride of the Rohirrim\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref> Tolkien denied that the name ''Gondor'' had been inspired by the ancient Ethiopian citadel of [[Gondar]], stating that the root ''Ond'' went back to an account he had read as a child mentioning ''ond'' (\"stone\") as one of only two words known of the [[pre-Celtic]] languages of Britain.<ref group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=#324}}</ref> Gondor is also called the South-kingdom or Southern Realm, and together with Arnor as the N\u00famen\u00f3rean Realms in Exile.

He notes that men from the two countries meet or behave in contrasting ways several times in ''The Lord of the Rings'': when \u00c9omer and his Riders of Rohan twice meet Aragorn's party in the Mark, and when Faramir and his men imprison Frodo and Sam at Henneth Annun in Ithilien. Shippey notes that while \u00c9omer is \"compulsively truculent\", Faramir is courteous, urbane, civilised: the people of Gondor are self-assured, and their culture is higher than that of Rohan. The same is seen, Shippey argues, in the comparison between the [[mead hall]] of [[Meduseld]] in Rohan, and the great hall of Minas Tirith in Gondor. Meduseld is simple, but brought to life by tapestries, a colourful stone floor, and the vivid picture of the rider, his bright hair streaming in the wind, blowing his horn. The Steward Denethor's hall is large and solemn, but dead, colourless, in cold stone. Rohan is, Shippey suggests, the \"bit that Tolkien knew best\",{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=146-149}} Anglo-Saxon, full of vigour; Gondor is \"a kind of Rome\", over-subtle, selfish, calculating.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=146-149}}\n\nThe critic [[Jane Chance Nitzsche]] contrasts the \"good and bad Germanic lords [[Th\u00e9oden]] and Denethor\", noting that their names are almost anagrams. She writes that both men receive the allegiance of a hobbit, but very differently: Denethor, Steward of Gondor, undervalues [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] because he is small, and binds him with a formal oath, whereas Th\u00e9oden, King of Rohan, treats [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] with love, which the hobbit responds to.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|pp=119-122}}\n\n==Influences==\n\nThe scholar of Germanic studies Sandra Ballif Straubhaar notes in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' that readers have debated the real-world prototypes of Gondor. She writes that like the [[Normans]], their founders the Numenoreans arrived \"from across the sea\", and that Prince Imrahil's armour with a \"burnished [[vambrace]]\" recalls late-medieval [[plate armour]]. Against this theory, she notes Tolkien's direction of readers to Egypt and Byzantium.<!--''Letters'', #?--> Recalling that Tolkien located Minas Tirith at the latitude of Florence, she states that \"the most striking similarities\" are with [[ancient Rome]]. She identifies several parallels: [[Aeneas]], from [[Troy]], and Elendil, from Numenor, both survive the destruction of their home countries; the brothers [[Romulus and Remus]] found Rome, while the brothers Isildur and An\u00e1rion found the Numenorean kingdoms in Middle-earth; and both Gondor and Rome experienced centuries of \"[[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|decadence and decline]]\".{{sfn|Straubhaar|2007|pp=248-249}} \n\nThe scholar of fantasy and children's literature Dimitra Fimi<!--U. of Glasgow--> draws a parallel between the seafaring Numenoreans and the [[Vikings]] of the Norse world, noting that in ''The Lost Road and Other Writings'', Tolkien describes their [[ship-burial]]s,<ref group=T>{{Harvnb|The Lost Road and Other Writings|loc=ch. 2 \"The Fall of Numenor\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1987}}}}</ref> matching those in ''[[Beowulf]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]''.{{sfn|Fimi|2007|pages=84-99}} She notes that Boromir is given a boat-funeral in ''The Two Towers''.<ref group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Two Towers|loc=book 3, ch. 1 \"The Departure of Boromir\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1954}}}}</ref>{{sfn|Fimi|2007|pages=84-99}} Fimi further compares the helmet and crown of Gondor with the romanticised \"headgear of the [[Valkyries]]\", despite Tolkien's denial of a connection with [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle]], noting the \"likeness of the wings of a sea-bird\"<ref group=\"T\">{{Harvnb|Return of the King|loc=book 6, ch. 5 \"The Steward and the King\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1955}}}}</ref> in his description of Aragorn's coronation, and his drawing of the crown in an unused dust jacket design.<ref group=T>''The Winged Crown of Gondor''.

Unlike Maine, Perot did not win any counties, though he placed second in nineteen of twenty-nine to overcome [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-AR) in the popular vote. Likewise it was the only time Bill Clinton finished third in a state, in either the 1992 or [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]], despite winning two counties. Utah and Maine (where Bush finished third behind Perot) in 1992 constitute the last time ({{As of|2016|11|alt=as of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]}}) that any major party candidate has finished third in a state, and the only time in a non-Confederate state since [[Robert M.

their ballots for electors: representatives to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Utah is allocated five electors because it has three [[Utah's congressional districts|congressional districts]] and two [[List of United States senators from Utah|senators]]. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of five electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins a plurality of votes in the state is awarded all five electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a [[faithless elector]].\n\nThe electors of each state and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] met in December 1992 to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. \n\nAll electors from Utah were pledged to and voted for George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{State Results of the 1992 U.S. presidential election}}\n\n[[Category:1992 United States presidential election by state|Utah]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Utah|1992]]\n[[Category:1992 Utah elections]]\n", "text_old": "{{main|1992 United States presidential election}}\n{{Infobox Election\n| election_name = 1992 [[United States presidential election]] in Utah\n| country = Utah\n| flag_year = 1913\n| type = presidential\n| ongoing = no\n| previous_election = 1988 United States presidential election in Utah\n| previous_year = 1988\n| next_election = 1996 United States presidential election in Utah\n| next_year = 1996\n| election_date = November 3, 1992\n| image_size = x160px\n| image1 = George H.

their ballots for electors: representatives to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Utah is allocated five electors because it has three [[Utah's congressional districts|congressional districts]] and two [[List of United States senators from Utah|senators]]. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of five electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins a plurality of votes in the state is awarded all five electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a [[faithless elector]].\n\nThe electors of each state and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] met in December 1992 to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. \n\nAll electors from Utah were pledged to and voted for George H.W. Bush and Dan Quayle.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{State Results of the 1992 U.S. presidential election}}\n\n[[Category:1992 United States presidential election by state|Utah]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Utah|1992]]\n[[Category:1992 Utah elections]]\n", "name_user": "MyPreferredUsernameWasTaken", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election_in_Utah"}

He founded groups significant in the British history of [[organic farming]]. He was said to have sympathised with [[Nazism]] and participated in inter-war far right politics, but this was speculation based on his approval of the German Youth Movement's aims of involving townspeople in country community life, such as helping with the harvest. He organised summer camps with music, dance and community aims across class and cultures. His forestry methods were far ahead of their time and he was a founder member of The [[Soil Association]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in [[Fulham]] the son of Sir [[Alan Gardiner|Alan Henderson Gardiner]] and his wife Hedwig, n\u00e9e Von Rosen.<ref name=\"whoswho\" /> He was educated at [[West Downs]] school from 1913,<ref name=\"westdowns\" /> [[Rugby School]], and then at [[Bedales School]].<ref name = Auden /><ref name=\"utopia-britannica\" /> He was a student at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he was a member of the [[Kibbo Kift]] youth group.{{sfn|Gottlieb|Linehan|2004|p=192}}\n\nInitially he was a youth leader, involved in exchanges with Germany.{{sfn|Moore-Colyer|2003|pp= 306\u2013324}} He was heavily influenced in the 1920s by [[D.

Prior to being canalised it was known as the River Grainne.

Before being named Ballyconnell it was named ''Maigen'' which means 'The Little Plain' with the local ford called ''\u00c1th na Mianna'' which means 'Ford of the Miners'. It was also named Gwyllymsbrook between 1660 and 1702 by its then owner, Thomas Gwyllym.<ref>http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=ballyconnell&streets=yes</ref>\n\nThe name is an anglicisation of ''B\u00e9l \u00c1tha Conaill'' which means \"The entrance to Conall's Ford\". The ford was a shallow crossing over the River Grainne and was the ancient border crossing for travellers going between [[Ulster]] and [[Connacht]]. The ford was caused by silt and gravel washed down from the nearby [[Slieve Rushen]] mountain by the Tanyard Stream which flows into the Grainne about 20 yards upriver from Ballyconnell bridge on the western outskirts of the town.\n\nConall was the great [[Ulster]] Hero and [[Red Branch]] knight [[Conall Cernach]], who was killed at Ballyconnell by the three Ruadhcoin sent by [[Medb|Queen Maeve]] of [[Connacht]] to avenge the slaying of her husband Ailill by Conall.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/13072981/The_Death_Of_Conall_Cernach_At_Ballyconnell_County_Cavan | title = The Death of Conall Cernach at Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan | author = Tom Smith | work = Breifne Journal | date = 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Prehistoric ===\n\nThe area was settled at an early date, as evidenced by the [[court cairn|double-court tomb]] in the town dating from c. 3,500 B.C. and a ring barrow in the same field (Sites number 31 & 107, Doon townland, ''Archaeological Inventory of County Cavan'', Patrick O\u2019Donovan, 1995, pp.&nbsp;7 & 22).\n\nThe ford would have been a logical place to erect a settlement and it probably dates from the time of the court tomb. The earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers rather than farmers. They lived by fishing, hunting wild game and foraging for berries and nuts. This area would have been thickly wooded at the time, with no roadways. The easiest way to travel would have been by boat via the river and the numerous lakes and streams in the area. The only other known megalith in the parish is a [[wedge tomb]] dating from 2000 B.C. on the side of [[Slieve Rushen]] mountain in [[Aughrim, County Cavan|Aughrim]] townland (Site number 7, Aughrim townland, ''Archaeological Inventory of County Cavan'',\nPatrick O\u2019Donovan, 1995, p.&nbsp;2). However, after remaining undisturbed for 4,000 years, it was recently dug up by the [[Quinn Group]] to enable them to mine sand deposits from the mountain. It was relocated to the grounds of the group's hotel, The Slieve Russell Hotel, to serve as a tourist attraction.\n\n=== Medieval ===\n\nIn ancient times, Ballyconnell lay on the eastern part of [[Magh Sl\u00e9cht]] named {{lang|ga|Maigin}} (\"the little plain\"), so called because it was a narrow strip bounded on the north by Slieve Rushen mountain and on the south by the River Graine. Maigin was the birthplace of [[Dall\u00e1n Forgaill|Saint Dall\u00e1n Forgaill]].\n\nIn medieval times the town belonged to the [[McGovern]] chiefs who had a fort there. Ballyconnell was situated in one of the ballybetoes of [[Tullyhaw]] named Calmhagh (Calva), which basically means almost the same as Maigin, the narrow plain. As it was on the border between Fermanagh and Breifne, Ballyconnell was a flash-point for the wars between the Maguires, O'Rourkes, O'Reillys, McGoverns, McKiernans and their allies. The Annals of Ireland record incidents at Ballyconnell in the following years-\n1323 Rory MacMahon, Mel O'Seagannain & MacMuldoon were slain at Ballyconnell by Cathal O'Rourke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005C/index.html |title=Annals of the Four Masters |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n1457 Brian Maguire fought with Lochlann O'Rourke, the McGoverns & McKiernans at Ballyconnell.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001C/index.html |title=The Annals of Ulster |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n1470 O'Donnell & O'Rourke fought with O'Reilly, the English and the McKiernans at Ballyconnell.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n1475 Hugh Roe O'Donnell went to Ballyconnell to make peace with the O'Reilly.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n1595 O'Donnell camped at Ballyconnell after raiding the town of Cavan.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n=== Post-1600 ===\n\nIn 1605 Captain Richard Tyrrell bought the Calva estate from Cormac Magauran.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924091770838#page/n583/mode/2up |title=Calendar of the state papers, relating to Ireland, of the reign of James I. 1603-1625.

However, in the launching of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in 1609, [[Sir Arthur Chichester]], the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], allowed Talbot to keep his estate as he had begun bringing in settlers and building houses.

Before being named Ballyconnell it was named ''Maigen'' which means 'The Little Plain' with the local ford called ''\u00c1th na Mianna'' which means 'Ford of the Miners'. It was also named Gwyllymsbrook between 1660 and 1702 by its then owner, Thomas Gwyllym.<ref>http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=ballyconnell&streets=yes</ref>\n\nThe name is an anglicisation of ''B\u00e9l \u00c1tha Conaill'' which means \"The entrance to Conall's Ford\". The ford was a shallow crossing over the River Grainne and was the ancient border crossing for travellers going between [[Ulster]] and [[Connacht]]. The ford was caused by silt and gravel washed down from the nearby [[Slieve Rushen]] mountain by the Tanyard Stream which flows into the Grainne about 20 yards upriver from Ballyconnell bridge on the western outskirts of the town.\n\nConall was the great [[Ulster]] Hero and [[Red Branch]] knight [[Conall Cernach]], who was killed at Ballyconnell by the three Ruadhcoin sent by [[Medb|Queen Maeve]] of [[Connacht]] to avenge the slaying of her husband Ailill by Conall.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/13072981/The_Death_Of_Conall_Cernach_At_Ballyconnell_County_Cavan | title = The Death of Conall Cernach at Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan | author = Tom Smith | work = Breifne Journal | date = 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Prehistoric ===\n\nThe area was settled at an early date, as evidenced by the [[court cairn|double-court tomb]] in the town dating from c. 3,500 B.C. and a ring barrow in the same field (Sites number 31 & 107, Doon townland, ''Archaeological Inventory of County Cavan'', Patrick O\u2019Donovan, 1995, pp.&nbsp;7 & 22).\n\nThe ford would have been a logical place to erect a settlement and it probably dates from the time of the court tomb. The earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers rather than farmers. They lived by fishing, hunting wild game and foraging for berries and nuts. This area would have been thickly wooded at the time, with no roadways. The easiest way to travel would have been by boat via the river and the numerous lakes and streams in the area. The only other known megalith in the parish is a [[wedge tomb]] dating from 2000 B.C. on the side of [[Slieve Rushen]] mountain in [[Aughrim, County Cavan|Aughrim]] townland (Site number 7, Aughrim townland, ''Archaeological Inventory of County Cavan'',\nPatrick O\u2019Donovan, 1995, p.&nbsp;2). However, after remaining undisturbed for 4,000 years, it was recently dug up by the [[Quinn Group]] to enable them to mine sand deposits from the mountain. It was relocated to the grounds of the group's hotel, The Slieve Russell Hotel, to serve as a tourist attraction.\n\n=== Medieval ===\n\nIn ancient times, Ballyconnell lay on the eastern part of [[Magh Sl\u00e9cht]] named {{lang|ga|Maigin}} (\"the little plain\"), so called because it was a narrow strip bounded on the north by Slieve Rushen mountain and on the south by the River Graine. Maigin was the birthplace of [[Dall\u00e1n Forgaill|Saint Dall\u00e1n Forgaill]].\n\nIn medieval times the town belonged to the [[McGovern]] chiefs who had a fort there. Ballyconnell was situated in one of the ballybetoes of [[Tullyhaw]] named Calmhagh (Calva), which basically means almost the same as Maigin, the narrow plain. As it was on the border between Fermanagh and Breifne, Ballyconnell was a flash-point for the wars between the Maguires, O'Rourkes, O'Reillys, McGoverns, McKiernans and their allies. The Annals of Ireland record incidents at Ballyconnell in the following years-\n1323 Rory MacMahon, Mel O'Seagannain & MacMuldoon were slain at Ballyconnell by Cathal O'Rourke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005C/index.html |title=Annals of the Four Masters |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n1457 Brian Maguire fought with Lochlann O'Rourke, the McGoverns & McKiernans at Ballyconnell.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001C/index.html |title=The Annals of Ulster |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref>\n1470 O'Donnell & O'Rourke fought with O'Reilly, the English and the McKiernans at Ballyconnell.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n1475 Hugh Roe O'Donnell went to Ballyconnell to make peace with the O'Reilly.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n1595 O'Donnell camped at Ballyconnell after raiding the town of Cavan.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n=== Post-1600 ===\n\nIn 1605 Captain Richard Tyrrell bought the Calva estate from Cormac Magauran.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924091770838#page/n583/mode/2up |title=Calendar of the state papers, relating to Ireland, of the reign of James I. 1603-1625.

However, in the launching of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in 1609, [[Sir Arthur Chichester]], the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], allowed Talbot to keep his estate as he had begun bringing in settlers and building houses.

Likewise, an antigen can also be conjugated to the antibody with a fluorescent probe in a technique called fluorescent antigen technique. Staining procedures can apply to both fixed antigen in the cytoplasm or to cell surface antigens on living cells, called \"membrane immunofluorescence\". It is also possible to label the complement of the antibody-antigen complex with a fluorescent probe.  In addition to the element to which fluorescence probes are attached, there are two general classes of immunofluorescence techniques: primary and secondary. The following descriptions will focus primarily on these classes in terms of conjugated antibodies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere are two classes of immunofluorescence techniques, primary (or direct) and secondary (or indirect).\n\n===Primary (direct)===\nPrimary (direct) immunofluorescence uses a single, primary antibody, chemically linked to a [[fluorophore]]. The primary antibody recognizes the target molecule (antigen) and binds to a specific region called the epitope. This is accomplished by a process which manipulates the immune response of organism with adaptive immunity. The attached fluorophore can be detected via fluorescent microscopy, which, depending on the messenger used, will emit a specific wavelength of light once excited.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.dako.com/08002_03aug09_ihc_guidebook_5th_edition_chapter_10.pdf | chapter = Immunohistochemical Staining Methods | title = IHC Guidebook | edition = Sixth | date = 2013 | publisher = Dako Denmark A/S, An Agilent Technologies Company }}</ref> Direct immunofluorescence, although somewhat less common, has notable advantages over the secondary (indirect) procedure. The direct attachment of the messenger to the antibody reduces the number of steps in the procedure, saving time and reducing non-specific background signal.<ref name=Frit>{{cite book | last1 = Fritschy | first1 = Jean-Marc | last2 = H\u00e4rtig | first2 = Wolfgang | name-list-format = vanc | title = Immunofluorescence | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001174 | url = http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0001174.html | year = 2001 | journal = eLS}}</ref> This also limits the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity and possible mistakes throughout the process. </ref> However, some disadvantages do exist in this method. Since the number of fluorescent molecules that can be bound to the primary antibody is limited, direct immunofluorescence is substantially less sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence and may result in false negatives. Direct immunofluorescence also requires the use of much more primary antibody, which is extremely expensive, sometimes running up to $400.00/mL.\n\n===Secondary (indirect)===\n[[File:Blood vessels in porcine skin - SMA A488 - 20x.jpg|thumb|right|A fluorescent stain for [[actin]] in the [[smooth muscle]] of the skin.]]\nSecondary (indirect) immunofluorescence uses two antibodies; the unlabeled first  (primary) antibody specifically binds the target molecule, and the secondary antibody, which carries the fluorophore, recognizes the primary antibody and binds to it.  Multiple secondary antibodies can bind a single primary antibody.  This provides signal amplification by increasing the number of fluorophore molecules per antigen.<ref name=Frit/> This protocol is more complex and time-consuming than the primary (or direct) protocol above, but allows more flexibility because a variety of different secondary antibodies and detection techniques can be used for a given primary antibody.<ref name=Frit/>\n\nThis protocol is possible because an antibody consists of two parts, a variable region (which recognizes the antigen) and constant region (which makes up the structure of the antibody molecule). It is important to realize that this division is artificial and in reality the antibody molecule is four polypeptide chains: two heavy chains and two light chains. A researcher can generate several primary antibodies that recognize various antigens (have different variable regions), but all share the same constant region. All these antibodies may therefore be recognized by a single secondary antibody. This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibodies to directly carry a fluorophore.\n\nDifferent primary antibodies with different constant regions are typically generated by raising the antibody in different species. For example, a researcher might create primary antibodies in a goat that recognize several antigens, and then employ dye-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies that recognize the goat antibody constant region (\"rabbit anti-goat\" antibodies). The researcher may then create a second set of primary antibodies in a mouse that could be recognized by a separate \"donkey anti-mouse\" secondary antibody. This allows re-use of the difficult-to-make dye-coupled antibodies in multiple experiments.\n\n==Limitations==\nAs with most fluorescence techniques, a significant problem with immunofluorescence is [[photobleaching]].  Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., [[Alexa Fluor]]s, Seta Fluors, or [[DyLight Fluor]]s). Some problems that may arise from this technique include autofluorescence, extraneous undesired specific fluorescence, and nonspecific fluorescence. Autofluorescence includes fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs when a targeted antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants. Nonspecific fluorescence involves the loss of a probe's specificity due to fluorophore, from improper fixation, or from a dried out specimen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nImmunofluorescence is only limited to fixed (i.e., dead) cells when structures within the cell are to be visualized because antibodies do not penetrate the cell membrane when reacting with fluorescent labels.

Conversely, secondary immunofluorescence is depicted to the right, which shows that first an untagged primary antibody binds to the epitope of the antigen in a mechanism similar to the one described above. However, after the primary antibodies have bound to their target, a secondary antibody (tagged with a fluorophore) comes along.

Likewise, an antigen can also be conjugated to the antibody with a fluorescent probe in a technique called fluorescent antigen technique. Staining procedures can apply to both fixed antigen in the cytoplasm or to cell surface antigens on living cells, called \"membrane immunofluorescence\". It is also possible to label the complement of the antibody-antigen complex with a fluorescent probe.  In addition to the element to which fluorescence probes are attached, there are two general classes of immunofluorescence techniques: primary and secondary. The following descriptions will focus primarily on these classes in terms of conjugated antibodies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere are two classes of immunofluorescence techniques, primary (or direct) and secondary (or indirect).\n\n===Primary (direct)===\nPrimary (direct) immunofluorescence uses a single, primary antibody, chemically linked to a [[fluorophore]]. The primary antibody recognizes the target molecule (antigen) and binds to a specific region called the epitope. This is accomplished by a process which manipulates the immune response of organism with adaptive immunity. The attached fluorophore can be detected via fluorescent microscopy, which, depending on the messenger used, will emit a specific wavelength of light once excited.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.dako.com/08002_03aug09_ihc_guidebook_5th_edition_chapter_10.pdf | chapter = Immunohistochemical Staining Methods | title = IHC Guidebook | edition = Sixth | date = 2013 | publisher = Dako Denmark A/S, An Agilent Technologies Company }}</ref> Direct immunofluorescence, although somewhat less common, has notable advantages over the secondary (indirect) procedure. The direct attachment of the messenger to the antibody reduces the number of steps in the procedure, saving time and reducing non-specific background signal.<ref name=Frit>{{cite book | last1 = Fritschy | first1 = Jean-Marc | last2 = H\u00e4rtig | first2 = Wolfgang | name-list-format = vanc | title = Immunofluorescence | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001174 | url = http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0001174.html | year = 2001 | journal = eLS | This also limits the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity and possible mistakes throughout the process. </ref> However, some disadvantages do exist in this method. Since the number of fluorescent molecules that can be bound to the primary antibody is limited, direct immunofluorescence is substantially less sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence and may result in false negatives. Direct immunofluorescence also requires the use of much more primary antibody, which is extremely expensive, sometimes running up to $400.00/mL.\n\n===Secondary (indirect)===\n[[File:Blood vessels in porcine skin - SMA A488 - 20x.jpg|thumb|right|A fluorescent stain for [[actin]] in the [[smooth muscle]] of the skin.]]\nSecondary (indirect) immunofluorescence uses two antibodies; the unlabeled first  (primary) antibody specifically binds the target molecule, and the secondary antibody, which carries the fluorophore, recognizes the primary antibody and binds to it.  Multiple secondary antibodies can bind a single primary antibody.  This provides signal amplification by increasing the number of fluorophore molecules per antigen.<ref name=Frit/> This protocol is more complex and time-consuming than the primary (or direct) protocol above, but allows more flexibility because a variety of different secondary antibodies and detection techniques can be used for a given primary antibody.<ref name=Frit/>\n\nThis protocol is possible because an antibody consists of two parts, a variable region (which recognizes the antigen) and constant region (which makes up the structure of the antibody molecule). It is important to realize that this division is artificial and in reality the antibody molecule is four polypeptide chains: two heavy chains and two light chains. A researcher can generate several primary antibodies that recognize various antigens (have different variable regions), but all share the same constant region. All these antibodies may therefore be recognized by a single secondary antibody. This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibodies to directly carry a fluorophore.\n\nDifferent primary antibodies with different constant regions are typically generated by raising the antibody in different species. For example, a researcher might create primary antibodies in a goat that recognize several antigens, and then employ dye-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies that recognize the goat antibody constant region (\"rabbit anti-goat\" antibodies). The researcher may then create a second set of primary antibodies in a mouse that could be recognized by a separate \"donkey anti-mouse\" secondary antibody. This allows re-use of the difficult-to-make dye-coupled antibodies in multiple experiments.\n\n==Limitations==\nAs with most fluorescence techniques, a significant problem with immunofluorescence is [[photobleaching]].  Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., [[Alexa Fluor]]s, Seta Fluors, or [[DyLight Fluor]]s).

With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public.

Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.\n\nFuller was highly controversial in British politics because of his support for the organised fascist movement. He was also an [[occult]]ist and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] who wrote a number of works on [[esotericism]] and [[mysticism]].\n\nHowever, he was also, earlier in life, a proponent of mechanised warfare, particularly using tanks.

He helped plan the tank attack at the 20 November 1917 [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] and the tank operations for the Autumn offensives of 1918.  His [[Plan 1919]] for a fully mechanised offensive against the German army was never implemented.  After 1918 he held various leading positions, notably as a commander of an experimental brigade at [[Aldershot]].\n\nAfter the war Fuller collaborated with his junior [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] in developing new ideas for the [[mechanisation]] of armies, \nlaunching a crusade for the mechanisation and modernisation of the British Army.  Chief instructor of [[Camberley Staff College]] from 1923, he became military assistant to the chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1926.  \nIn what came to be known as the \"Tidworth Incident\", Fuller turned down the command of the [[Experimental Mechanized Force]], which was formed on 27 August 1927.  The appointment also carried responsibility for a regular infantry brigade and the garrison of [[Tidworth Camp]] on [[Salisbury Plain]].  Fuller believed he would be unable to devote himself to the Experimental Mechanized Force and the development of mechanized warfare techniques without extra staff to assist him with the additional extraneous duties, which the [[War Office]] refused to allocate.\nHe was promoted to major-general in 1930 and retired three years later to devote himself entirely to writing.<ref>Trythall,  ''\"Boney\" Fuller: The Intellectual General'' (1977)</ref>\n\n==Retirement and fascism==\nAfter retirement, Fuller served as a reporter during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (1935) and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939). On his retirement in 1933, impatient with what he considered the inability of democracy to adopt military reforms, Fuller became involved with Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] and the British [[fascist]] movement.  As a member of the [[British Union of Fascists]] he sat on the party's Policy Directorate and was considered one of Mosley's closest allies.<ref>https://www.oswaldmosley.com/j-f-c-fuller/</ref> He was also a member of the clandestine [[far-right]] group the [[Nordic League]].<ref>Richard Thurlow, ''Fascism in Britain: A History, 1918\u20131985'', (1987), p. 80</ref>\n\nFuller's ideas on mechanised warfare continued to be influential in the lead-up to the Second World War, ironically less with his countrymen than with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], notably [[Heinz Guderian]] who spent his own money to have Fuller's ''Provisional Instructions for Tank and Armoured Car Training'' translated.<ref name=\"atkin1990\">{{cite book | title=Pillar of Fire: Dunkirk 1940 | publisher=Birlinn Limited | author=Atkin, Ronald | year=1990 | location=Edinburgh | page=26 | isbn=1 84158 078 3}}</ref>  In the 1930s the German [[Wehrmacht|Army]] implemented tactics similar in many ways to Fuller's analysis, which became known as [[Blitzkrieg]].  Like Fuller, theorists of Blitzkrieg partly based their approach on the theory that areas of large enemy activity should be bypassed to be eventually surrounded and destroyed.  Blitzkrieg-style tactics were used by several nations throughout the Second World War, predominantly by the Germans in the invasion of Poland (1939), Western Europe (1940), and the Soviet Union (1941).  While Germany and to some degree the Western Allies adopted Blitzkrieg ideas, they were not much used by the [[Red Army]], which developed its armored warfare doctrine based on [[deep operations]], which were developed by Soviet military theorists Marshal [[Tukhachevsky|M. N. Tukhachevsky]] et al. in the 1920s based on their experiences in the First World War and the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nFuller was the only foreigner present at Nazi Germany's first armed manoeuvres in 1935. Fuller frequently praised Adolf Hitler in his speeches and articles, once describing him as \"that realistic idealist who has awakened the common sense of the British people by setting out to create a new Germany\".<ref name=\"McKinstry\">{{cite book|last=McKinstry|first=Leo|title=Operation Sealion|publisher=John Murray|year=2014|isbn=978-1-84854-704-9}} (p. 217)</ref> On 20 April 1939 Fuller was an honoured guest at Hitler's 50th birthday parade, watching as \"for three hours a completely mechanised and motorised army roared past the F\u00fchrer.\" Afterwards Hitler asked, \"I hope you were pleased with your children?\" Fuller replied, \"Your Excellency, they have grown up so quickly that I no longer recognise them.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Gotham\n| isbn = 978-1-59240-222-9\n| last = Boot\n| first = Max\n| title = War made new: technology, warfare, and the course of history, 1500 to today\n| year = 2006\n| url-access = registration\n| url = https://archive.org/details/warmadenewtechno00boot\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], 1939\u20131945, Fuller was under suspicion for his Nazi sympathies. He continued to speak out in favour of a peaceful settlement with Germany.<ref name=\"McKinstry\"/>  [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] (in his war diaries, p.&nbsp;201) comments that \"the Director of Security called on him to discuss Boney Fuller and his Nazi activities\", but Brooke commented that he did not think Fuller \"had any unpatriotic intentions\". Although he was not interned or arrested, he was the only officer of his rank not invited to return to service during the war. There was some suspicion that he was not incarcerated in May 1940 along with other leading officials of the BUF because of his association with General  [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|Edmund Ironside]] and other senior officers. Mosley himself admitted to \"a little puzzlement\" as to why Fuller had not been imprisoned.<ref name=\"McKinstry\"/>\n\nFuller spent his last years a deeply-embittered man who believed that the wrong side had won the Second World War and most fully announced that thesis in the 1961 edition of ''The Reformation of War''. There, he announced his belief that Hitler was the saviour of the West against the Soviet Union and denounced Churchill and Roosevelt for being too stupid to see so. Fuller died in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], Cornwall, in 1966.\n\n==Military theories==\nFuller was a vigorous, expressive, and opinionated writer of [[military history]] and of controversial predictions of the future of war, publishing ''On Future Warfare'' in 1928. Seeing his teachings largely vindicated by the Second World War, he published ''Machine Warfare: An Enquiry into the Influence of Mechanics on the Art of War'' in 1942.\n\n===''The Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926)===\nFuller is perhaps best known today for his \"Nine Principles of War\"<ref>''The Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6</ref> which have formed the foundation of much of modern military theory since the 1930s, and which were originally derived from a convergence of Fuller's mystical and military interests. The Nine Principles went through several iterations; Fuller stated that \"the system evolved from six principles in 1912, rose to eight in 1915, to, virtually, nineteen in 1923, and then descended to nine in 1925\".<ref name=Foundations>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=J. F.

They have been expressed in various ways, but Fuller's 1925 arrangement is as follows:\n\n# '''Direction:''' What is the overall aim? Which objectives must be met to achieve the aim?\n# '''Concentration:''' Where will the commander focus the most effort?\n# '''Distribution:''' Where and how will the commander position their force?\n# '''Determination:''' The will to fight, the will to persevere, and the will to win must be maintained.\n# '''Surprise (Demoralisation of Force):''' The commander's ability to veil their intentions while discovering those of their enemy. Properly executed ''Surprise'' unbalances the enemy \u2013 causing Demoralisation of Force.\n# '''Endurance:''' The force's resistance to pressure. This is measured by the force's ability to anticipate complications and threats. This is enhanced by planning on how best to avoid, overcome, or negate them and then properly educating and training the force in these methods.\n# '''Mobility:''' The commander's ability to manoeuvre their force while outmanoeuvring the enemy's forces.\n# '''Offensive Action (Disorganisation of Force):''' The ability to gain and maintain the initiative in combat. Properly executed ''Offensive Action'' disrupts the enemy - causing Disorganisation of Force.\n# '''Security:''' The ability to protect the force from threats.\n\n====Triads and Trichotomies====\nCabalistic influences on his theories can be evidenced by his use of the \"[[Trichotomy (philosophy)|Law of Threes]]\" throughout his work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6</ref> Fuller didn't believe the Principles stood alone as is thought today,<ref>''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6; Diagrams 17, 18 & 19</ref> but that they complemented and overlapped each other as part of a whole, forming the [[Economy of force|Law of Economy of Force]].<ref>Foundations of the Science of War (1926 ed.); \"be reduced to three groups, namely, principles of control, resistance, and pressure, and finally to one law \u2013 the law of economy of force\".</ref>\n\n====Organisation of Force====\nThese Principles were further grouped into the categories of ''Control'' (command / co-operation), ''Pressure'' (attack / activity) and ''Resistance'' (protection / stability). The Principles of Control guides the dual Principles of Pressure and of Resistance, which in turn create the Principles of Control.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n*'''Principles of Control (1, 4, & 7):''' Direction, Determination, & Mobility.\n*'''Principles of Pressure (2, 5, & 8):''' Concentration, Surprise, & Offensive Action.\n*'''Principles of Resistance (3, 6, & 9):''' Distribution, Endurance, & Security.\n\n====The Unity of the Principles of War====\nThey were also grouped into Cosmic (''Spiritual''),  Mental (''Mind / Thought / Reason''), Moral (''Soul / Sensations / Emotions''), and Physical (''Body / Musculature / Action'') Spheres, in which two Principles (like the double-edged point of an arrowhead) combine to create or manifest a third, which in turn guides the first and second Principles (like the fletches on an arrow's tail). Each Sphere leads to the creation of the next until it returns to the beginning and repeats the circular cycle with reassessments of the ''Object'' and ''Objective'' to redefine the uses of ''Force''. The Cosmic Sphere is seen as outside the other three Spheres, like the Heavens are outside the Realm of Man. They influence it indirectly in ways that cannot be controlled by the commander, but they are a factor in the use of Force. Force resides in the center of the pattern, as all of these elements revolve around it.<ref>''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6; Diagram 17.</ref> \n*'''Cosmic Sphere:''' Goal (''Object'') & Desire (''Objective'') =  Method (''Economy of Force'')\n**''Goal'' is the overall purpose or aim of the mission (what Goals must the mission complete or achieve?).\n**''Desire'' concerns the priority of the achievement or acquisition of the Goal (how important and essential is the Goal to the overall mission effort?).  \n**''Method'' is how the forces available will carry out the mission (How much of the mission's force will be assigned - or are available \u2013 to accomplish the Goal?).  \n*'''Mental Sphere (1, 2, & 3):''' Reason (''Direction'') & Imagination (''Concentration'') = Will (''Distribution'')\n*'''Moral Sphere (4, 5, & 6):'''  Fear (''Determination'')  & Morale (''Surprise'') = Courage (''Endurance'')\n*'''Physical Sphere (7, 8, & 9):''' Attack (''Offensive Action'') & Protection (''Security'') = Movement (''Mobility'')\n\nThese [[Principles of War]] have been adopted and further refined by the military forces of several nations, most notably within NATO, and continue to be applied widely to modern strategic thinking. Recently they have also been applied to business tactics<ref>\n{{Citation\n| publisher = Tactica\n| last = McNeil\n| first = Paul\n| title = How to Apply Military Principles to High Value Sales Campaigns\n| year = 2008\n}}</ref> and hobby [[wargaming]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Bigred\n| title = 40K Tactics: Nine Principles of War\n| work = Bell of Lost Souls\n| accessdate =21 December 2009\n| date = 7 October 2009\n| url = http://www.belloflostsouls.net/2009/10/40k-tactics-nine-principles-of-war-pt-1.html\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Armament and History (1945)''===\nFuller also developed the idea of the ''Constant Tactical Factor''. This states that every improvement in warfare is checked by a counter-improvement, causing the advantage to shift back and forth between the offensive and the defensive. Fuller's firsthand experience in the First World War saw a shift from the defensive power of the machine gun to the offensive power of the tank.\n\n==Magic and mysticism==\nFuller had an [[occultist]] side that oddly mixed with his military side.  He was an early disciple of English poet and magician [[Aleister Crowley]], and was very familiar with his and other forms of [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]] and [[Thelemic mysticism|mysticism]].  While serving in the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry#Operations across the Empire (1881\u20131914)|First Oxfordshire Light Infantry]] he had entered and won a contest to write the best review of Crowley's poetic works, after which it turned out that he was the only entrant.  This essay was later published in book form in 1907 as ''The Star in the West''.  After this he became an enthusiastic supporter of Crowley, joining his magical order, the [[A\u2234A\u2234]]., within which he became a leading member, editing order documents and its journal, ''[[The Equinox]]''. During this period he wrote ''The Treasure House of Images'', edited early sections of Crowley's magical autobiography ''The Temple of Solomon the King'' and produced highly regarded paintings dealing with A\u2234A\u2234 teachings: these paintings have been used in recent years as the covers of the journal's revival, ''The Equinox, Volume IV''.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Red Wheel/Weiser\n| isbn = 978-0-87728-888-6\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| others = Hymenaeus.

Crowley writes in chapter 67 of his book, ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'':\n\n{{quote|\n...to my breathless amazement he fired pointblank at my head a document in which he agreed to continue his co-operation on condition that I refrain from mentioning his name in public or private under penalty of paying him a hundred pounds for each such offence. I sat down and poured in a broadside at close quarters.\n\n\"My dear man,\" I said in effect, \"do recover your sense of proportion, to say nothing of your sense of humour. Your contribution, indeed! I can do in two days what takes you six months, and my real reason for ever printing your work at all is my friendship for you. I wanted to give you a leg up the literary ladder. I have taken endless pain to teach you the first principles of writing. When I met you, you were not so much as a fifth-rate journalist, and now you can write quite good prose with no more than my blue pencil through two out of every three adjectives, and five out of every six commas.

The front pages of the 1913 issues of the ''Equinox'' (Volume 1, nos. 9 and 10), which gave general directions to A\u2234A\u2234 members, included a notice on the subject of Fuller, who was described as a \"former Probationer\";<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.the-equinox.org/vol1/no9/eqi09000.html |title=Sun in Aries: Frontpages |journal=The Equinox |volume=1 |number=9 |date=March 1913 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}</ref> the notice disparaged Fuller's magical accomplishments and warned A\u2234A\u2234 members to accept no magical training from him. However, Fuller continued to be fascinated with [[occult]] subjects and in later years he would write about topics such as the [[Qabalah]] and [[yoga]].\n\n==Works==\nFuller was a prolific writer and published 45+ books.<ref name=Trythall>{{cite book|last=Trythall|first=A.J.|title=\"Boney\" Fuller: The Intellectual General|url=https://archive.org/details/boneyfullerintel0000tryt|url-access=registration|year=1977|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=978-0-933852-98-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/boneyfullerintel0000tryt/page/314 314]}}</ref>\n\n* ''The Star in The West: A Critical Essay Upon the Works of [[Aleister Crowley]]'' (London: Walter Scott Publishing Co., 1907) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924013603455 read online]\n* ''Tanks in the Great War: 1914-1918'' (New York: [[E.P.

With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public. He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector. Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically.\n\nFuller was highly controversial in British politics because of his support for the organised fascist movement. He was also an [[occult]]ist and [[Thelema|Thelemite]] who wrote a number of works on [[esotericism]] and [[mysticism]].\n\nHowever, he was also, earlier in life, a proponent of mechanised warfare, particularly using tanks. This was clearly something utilised by the German forces in their Blitzkrieg approach in the 1930s\n\n==Early life==\nFuller was born in [[Chichester]], [[West Sussex]], the son of an Anglican clergyman.<ref>Tucker, Spencer C., ''The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|1135507015}}, p. 280</ref>  After moving to [[Lausanne]] with his parents as a boy, he returned to England at the age of 11 without them; three years later, at \"the somewhat advanced age of 14\", he began attending [[Malvern College]]<ref name=\"Memoirs\">Fuller, ''Memoirs of an Unconventional Soldier'', Ivor Nicholson and Watson Ltd., London, 1936, ch. 1</ref> and, later trained for an army career at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], from 1897 to 1898. His nickname of \"Boney\", which he was to retain, is said to have come either from an admiration for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]],<ref>Brian Holden Reid, ''J. F. C. Fuller: Military Thinker'', Macmillan, 1987, p. 3.</ref> or from an imperious manner combined with military brilliance which resembled Napoleon's.<ref>[[Trevor N. Dupuy]], Curt Johnson, David L. Bongard, ''[[Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography]]'', HarperCollins, 1992, p. 268</ref>\n\n==Career==\nFuller was commissioned into the 1st Battalion of the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|Oxfordshire Light Infantry]] (the old [[43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot|43rd Foot]]), and served in [[South Africa]] from 1899 to 1902.  In the spring of 1904 Fuller was sent with his unit to India, where he contracted [[typhoid fever]] in autumn of 1905; he returned to England the next year on sick-leave, where he met the woman he married in December 1906.<ref name=\"Memoirs\"/> Instead of returning to India, he was reassigned to [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer]] units in England, serving as [[adjutant]] to the 2nd South Middlesex Volunteers (amalgamated into the [[Kensington Regiment (Princess Louise's)|Kensingtons]] during the [[Haldane Reforms]]) and helping to form the new [[10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment|10th Middlesex]]. Fuller later claimed that his position with the 10th Middlesex inspired him to study soldiering seriously.<ref>Ian F.W. Beckett, ''Riflemen Form: A Study of the Rifle Volunteer Movement 1859\u20131908'', Aldershot: Ogilby Trusts, 1982, {{ISBN|0 85936 271 X}}, p. 202.</ref><ref>Fuller, ''Memoirs of an Unconventional Soldier'', pp. 10-21.</ref> In 1913 he was accepted into the [[Staff College, Camberley]], starting work there in January 1914.<ref>A. J. Trythall,  ''\"Boney\" Fuller: The Intellectual General'' (1977)</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Fuller was a staff officer with the Home Forces and with [[VII Corps (United Kingdom)|VII Corps]] in France, and from 1916 in the Headquarters of the [[Machine-Gun Corps]]' Heavy Branch which was later to become the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]].  He helped plan the tank attack at the 20 November 1917 [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] and the tank operations for the Autumn offensives of 1918.  His [[Plan 1919]] for a fully mechanised offensive against the German army was never implemented.  After 1918 he held various leading positions, notably as a commander of an experimental brigade at [[Aldershot]].\n\nAfter the war Fuller collaborated with his junior [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] in developing new ideas for the [[mechanisation]] of armies, \nlaunching a crusade for the mechanisation and modernisation of the British Army.  Chief instructor of [[Camberley Staff College]] from 1923, he became military assistant to the chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1926.  \nIn what came to be known as the \"Tidworth Incident\", Fuller turned down the command of the [[Experimental Mechanized Force]], which was formed on 27 August 1927.  The appointment also carried responsibility for a regular infantry brigade and the garrison of [[Tidworth Camp]] on [[Salisbury Plain]].  Fuller believed he would be unable to devote himself to the Experimental Mechanized Force and the development of mechanized warfare techniques without extra staff to assist him with the additional extraneous duties, which the [[War Office]] refused to allocate.\nHe was promoted to major-general in 1930 and retired three years later to devote himself entirely to writing.<ref>Trythall,  ''\"Boney\" Fuller: The Intellectual General'' (1977)</ref>\n\n==Retirement and fascism==\nAfter retirement, Fuller served as a reporter during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (1935) and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939). On his retirement in 1933, impatient with what he considered the inability of democracy to adopt military reforms, Fuller became involved with Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] and the British [[fascist]] movement.  As a member of the [[British Union of Fascists]] he sat on the party's Policy Directorate and was considered one of Mosley's closest allies.<ref>https://www.oswaldmosley.com/j-f-c-fuller/</ref> He was also a member of the clandestine [[far-right]] group the [[Nordic League]].<ref>Richard Thurlow, ''Fascism in Britain: A History, 1918\u20131985'', (1987), p. 80</ref>\n\nFuller's ideas on mechanised warfare continued to be influential in the lead-up to the Second World War, ironically less with his countrymen than with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], notably [[Heinz Guderian]] who spent his own money to have Fuller's ''Provisional Instructions for Tank and Armoured Car Training'' translated.<ref name=\"atkin1990\">{{cite book | title=Pillar of Fire: Dunkirk 1940 | publisher=Birlinn Limited | author=Atkin, Ronald | year=1990 | location=Edinburgh | page=26 | isbn=1 84158 078 3}}</ref>  In the 1930s the German [[Wehrmacht|Army]] implemented tactics similar in many ways to Fuller's analysis, which became known as [[Blitzkrieg]].  Like Fuller, theorists of Blitzkrieg partly based their approach on the theory that areas of large enemy activity should be bypassed to be eventually surrounded and destroyed.  Blitzkrieg-style tactics were used by several nations throughout the Second World War, predominantly by the Germans in the invasion of Poland (1939), Western Europe (1940), and the Soviet Union (1941).  While Germany and to some degree the Western Allies adopted Blitzkrieg ideas, they were not much used by the [[Red Army]], which developed its armored warfare doctrine based on [[deep operations]], which were developed by Soviet military theorists Marshal [[Tukhachevsky|M. N. Tukhachevsky]] et al. in the 1920s based on their experiences in the First World War and the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\nFuller was the only foreigner present at Nazi Germany's first armed manoeuvres in 1935. Fuller frequently praised Adolf Hitler in his speeches and articles, once describing him as \"that realistic idealist who has awakened the common sense of the British people by setting out to create a new Germany\".<ref name=\"McKinstry\">{{cite book|last=McKinstry|first=Leo|title=Operation Sealion|publisher=John Murray|year=2014|isbn=978-1-84854-704-9}} (p. 217)</ref> On 20 April 1939 Fuller was an honoured guest at Hitler's 50th birthday parade, watching as \"for three hours a completely mechanised and motorised army roared past the F\u00fchrer.\" Afterwards Hitler asked, \"I hope you were pleased with your children?\" Fuller replied, \"Your Excellency, they have grown up so quickly that I no longer recognise them.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Gotham\n| isbn = 978-1-59240-222-9\n| last = Boot\n| first = Max\n| title = War made new: technology, warfare, and the course of history, 1500 to today\n| year = 2006\n| url-access = registration\n| url = https://archive.org/details/warmadenewtechno00boot\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], 1939\u20131945, Fuller was under suspicion for his Nazi sympathies. He continued to speak out in favour of a peaceful settlement with Germany.<ref name=\"McKinstry\"/>  [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] (in his war diaries, p.&nbsp;201) comments that \"the Director of Security called on him to discuss Boney Fuller and his Nazi activities\", but Brooke commented that he did not think Fuller \"had any unpatriotic intentions\". Although he was not interned or arrested, he was the only officer of his rank not invited to return to service during the war. There was some suspicion that he was not incarcerated in May 1940 along with other leading officials of the BUF because of his association with General  [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|Edmund Ironside]] and other senior officers. Mosley himself admitted to \"a little puzzlement\" as to why Fuller had not been imprisoned.<ref name=\"McKinstry\"/>\n\nFuller spent his last years a deeply-embittered man who believed that the wrong side had won the Second World War and most fully announced that thesis in the 1961 edition of ''The Reformation of War''. There, he announced his belief that Hitler was the saviour of the West against the Soviet Union and denounced Churchill and Roosevelt for being too stupid to see so. Fuller died in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], Cornwall, in 1966.\n\n==Military theories==\nFuller was a vigorous, expressive, and opinionated writer of [[military history]] and of controversial predictions of the future of war, publishing ''On Future Warfare'' in 1928. Seeing his teachings largely vindicated by the Second World War, he published ''Machine Warfare: An Enquiry into the Influence of Mechanics on the Art of War'' in 1942.\n\n===''The Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926)===\nFuller is perhaps best known today for his \"Nine Principles of War\"<ref>''The Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6</ref> which have formed the foundation of much of modern military theory since the 1930s, and which were originally derived from a convergence of Fuller's mystical and military interests. The Nine Principles went through several iterations; Fuller stated that \"the system evolved from six principles in 1912, rose to eight in 1915, to, virtually, nineteen in 1923, and then descended to nine in 1925\".<ref name=Foundations>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=J.

They have been expressed in various ways, but Fuller's 1925 arrangement is as follows:\n\n# '''Direction:''' What is the overall aim? Which objectives must be met to achieve the aim?\n# '''Concentration:''' Where will the commander focus the most effort?\n# '''Distribution:''' Where and how will the commander position their force?\n# '''Determination:''' The will to fight, the will to persevere, and the will to win must be maintained.\n# '''Surprise (Demoralisation of Force):''' The commander's ability to veil their intentions while discovering those of their enemy. Properly executed ''Surprise'' unbalances the enemy \u2013 causing Demoralisation of Force.\n# '''Endurance:''' The force's resistance to pressure. This is measured by the force's ability to anticipate complications and threats. This is enhanced by planning on how best to avoid, overcome, or negate them and then properly educating and training the force in these methods.\n# '''Mobility:''' The commander's ability to manoeuvre their force while outmanoeuvring the enemy's forces.\n# '''Offensive Action (Disorganisation of Force):''' The ability to gain and maintain the initiative in combat. Properly executed ''Offensive Action'' disrupts the enemy - causing Disorganisation of Force.\n# '''Security:''' The ability to protect the force from threats.\n\n====Triads and Trichotomies====\nCabalistic influences on his theories can be evidenced by his use of the \"[[Trichotomy (philosophy)|Law of Threes]]\" throughout his work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6</ref> Fuller didn't believe the Principles stood alone as is thought today,<ref>''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6; Diagrams 17, 18 & 19</ref> but that they complemented and overlapped each other as part of a whole, forming the [[Economy of force|Law of Economy of Force]].<ref>Foundations of the Science of War (1926 ed.); \"be reduced to three groups, namely, principles of control, resistance, and pressure, and finally to one law \u2013 the law of economy of force\".</ref>\n\n====Organisation of Force====\nThese Principles were further grouped into the categories of ''Control'' (command / co-operation), ''Pressure'' (attack / activity) and ''Resistance'' (protection / stability). The Principles of Control guides the dual Principles of Pressure and of Resistance, which in turn create the Principles of Control.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n*'''Principles of Control (1, 4, & 7):''' Direction, Determination, & Mobility.\n*'''Principles of Pressure (2, 5, & 8):''' Concentration, Surprise, & Offensive Action.\n*'''Principles of Resistance (3, 6, & 9):''' Distribution, Endurance, & Security.\n\n====The Unity of the Principles of War====\nThey were also grouped into Cosmic (''Spiritual''),  Mental (''Mind / Thought / Reason''), Moral (''Soul / Sensations / Emotions''), and Physical (''Body / Musculature / Action'') Spheres, in which two Principles (like the double-edged point of an arrowhead) combine to create or manifest a third, which in turn guides the first and second Principles (like the fletches on an arrow's tail). Each Sphere leads to the creation of the next until it returns to the beginning and repeats the circular cycle with reassessments of the ''Object'' and ''Objective'' to redefine the uses of ''Force''. The Cosmic Sphere is seen as outside the other three Spheres, like the Heavens are outside the Realm of Man. They influence it indirectly in ways that cannot be controlled by the commander, but they are a factor in the use of Force. Force resides in the center of the pattern, as all of these elements revolve around it.<ref>''Foundations of the Science of War'' (1926 ed.); Chapter IX, Section 6; Diagram 17.</ref> \n*'''Cosmic Sphere:''' Goal (''Object'') & Desire (''Objective'') =  Method (''Economy of Force'')\n**''Goal'' is the overall purpose or aim of the mission (what Goals must the mission complete or achieve?).\n**''Desire'' concerns the priority of the achievement or acquisition of the Goal (how important and essential is the Goal to the overall mission effort?).  \n**''Method'' is how the forces available will carry out the mission (How much of the mission's force will be assigned - or are available \u2013 to accomplish the Goal?).  \n*'''Mental Sphere (1, 2, & 3):''' Reason (''Direction'') & Imagination (''Concentration'') = Will (''Distribution'')\n*'''Moral Sphere (4, 5, & 6):'''  Fear (''Determination'')  & Morale (''Surprise'') = Courage (''Endurance'')\n*'''Physical Sphere (7, 8, & 9):''' Attack (''Offensive Action'') & Protection (''Security'') = Movement (''Mobility'')\n\nThese [[Principles of War]] have been adopted and further refined by the military forces of several nations, most notably within NATO, and continue to be applied widely to modern strategic thinking. Recently they have also been applied to business tactics<ref>\n{{Citation\n| publisher = Tactica\n| last = McNeil\n| first = Paul\n| title = How to Apply Military Principles to High Value Sales Campaigns\n| year = 2008\n}}</ref> and hobby [[wargaming]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Bigred\n| title = 40K Tactics: Nine Principles of War\n| work = Bell of Lost Souls\n| accessdate =21 December 2009\n| date = 7 October 2009\n| url = http://www.belloflostsouls.net/2009/10/40k-tactics-nine-principles-of-war-pt-1.html\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Armament and History (1945)''===\nFuller also developed the idea of the ''Constant Tactical Factor''. This states that every improvement in warfare is checked by a counter-improvement, causing the advantage to shift back and forth between the offensive and the defensive. Fuller's firsthand experience in the First World War saw a shift from the defensive power of the machine gun to the offensive power of the tank.\n\n==Magic and mysticism==\nFuller had an [[occultist]] side that oddly mixed with his military side.  He was an early disciple of English poet and magician [[Aleister Crowley]], and was very familiar with his and other forms of [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]] and [[Thelemic mysticism|mysticism]].  While serving in the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry#Operations across the Empire (1881\u20131914)|First Oxfordshire Light Infantry]] he had entered and won a contest to write the best review of Crowley's poetic works, after which it turned out that he was the only entrant.  This essay was later published in book form in 1907 as ''The Star in the West''.  After this he became an enthusiastic supporter of Crowley, joining his magical order, the [[A\u2234A\u2234]]., within which he became a leading member, editing order documents and its journal, ''[[The Equinox]]''. During this period he wrote ''The Treasure House of Images'', edited early sections of Crowley's magical autobiography ''The Temple of Solomon the King'' and produced highly regarded paintings dealing with A\u2234A\u2234 teachings: these paintings have been used in recent years as the covers of the journal's revival, ''The Equinox, Volume IV''.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Red Wheel/Weiser\n| isbn = 978-0-87728-888-6\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| others = Hymenaeus.

Crowley writes in chapter 67 of his book, ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'':\n\n{{quote|\n...to my breathless amazement he fired pointblank at my head a document in which he agreed to continue his co-operation on condition that I refrain from mentioning his name in public or private under penalty of paying him a hundred pounds for each such offence. I sat down and poured in a broadside at close quarters.\n\n\"My dear man,\" I said in effect, \"do recover your sense of proportion, to say nothing of your sense of humour. Your contribution, indeed! I can do in two days what takes you six months, and my real reason for ever printing your work at all is my friendship for you. I wanted to give you a leg up the literary ladder. I have taken endless pain to teach you the first principles of writing. When I met you, you were not so much as a fifth-rate journalist, and now you can write quite good prose with no more than my blue pencil through two out of every three adjectives, and five out of every six commas.

The front pages of the 1913 issues of the ''Equinox'' (Volume 1, nos. 9 and 10), which gave general directions to A\u2234A\u2234 members, included a notice on the subject of Fuller, who was described as a \"former Probationer\";<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.the-equinox.org/vol1/no9/eqi09000.html |title=Sun in Aries: Frontpages |journal=The Equinox |volume=1 |number=9 |date=March 1913 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}</ref> the notice disparaged Fuller's magical accomplishments and warned A\u2234A\u2234 members to accept no magical training from him. However, Fuller continued to be fascinated with [[occult]] subjects and in later years he would write about topics such as the [[Qabalah]] and [[yoga]].\n\n==Works==\nFuller was a prolific writer and published 45+ books.<ref name=Trythall>{{cite book|last=Trythall|first=A.J.|title=\"Boney\" Fuller: The Intellectual General|url=https://archive.org/details/boneyfullerintel0000tryt|url-access=registration|year=1977|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=978-0-933852-98-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/boneyfullerintel0000tryt/page/314 314]}}</ref>\n\n* ''The Star in The West: A Critical Essay Upon the Works of [[Aleister Crowley]]'' (London: Walter Scott Publishing Co., 1907) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924013603455 read online]\n* ''Tanks in the Great War: 1914-1918'' (New York: [[E.P.

It further shares track with the [[Lambertseter Line]] along the {{convert|2.5|km|sp=us|adj=on}} section from [[T\u00f8yen (station)|T\u00f8yen]] to Brynseng. The line runs through the primary residential areas of [[B\u00f8ler]], [[\u00d8stensj\u00f8]] and [[S\u00f8ndre Nordstrand]]. The line is served by Line 3 of the metro.\n\nThe first section of the line was built by [[Akersbanerne]] as part of the [[Oslo Tramway]] and connected to the [[V\u00e5lerenga Line]] at [[Etterstad]]. The first section, to Bryn, opened on 18 December 1923, and was extended to [[Oppsal (station)|Oppsal]] in January 1926. Services were variously provided by [[Kristiania Sporveisselskab]], [[B\u00e6rumsbanen]] and [[Oslo Sporveier]]. Proposals for making the line part of the metro arose in the late 1940s and the system was approved in 1956. This materialized in an extension of the line to [[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler]] on 20 July 1958. The \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line became the third line of the metro on 26 November 1967, the same day the line was extended to Skullerud. The last extension, to Mortensrud, commenced services on 24 November 1997. There are proposals to extend the line further south to [[Bj\u00f8rndal]] and [[Gjersrud]].\n\n==Route==\n[[File:3 Mortensrud - Brynseng T - 2013-01-20 at 13-11-25.jpg|thumb|left|[[MX3000]] near [[Brynseng (station)|Brynseng]], where the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line runs next to the [[Lambertseter Line]] (right)]]\nThe \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line runs from T\u00f8yen on the [[Common Tunnel]] to Mortensrud, a distance of {{convert|9.0|km|sp=us}}.

From T\u00f8yen, where the [[Grorud Line]] branches off from the Common Tunnel, the line makes a 180-degree loop under the [[T\u00f8yen Park]].<ref name=h67>Haldsrud: 67</ref> At this point there is also a direct, single-track tunnel which allows non-revenue trains access from the Grorud Line.<ref>Halsrud: 87</ref> The line passes under the [[Gj\u00f8vik Line]] and leaves the tunnel just before [[Ensj\u00f8 (station)|Ensj\u00f8 Station]], which is located on a short section of ground-level track.<ref name=h67 /> After Ensj\u00f8 the line enters a new tunnel at Malerhaugen, which includes the underground [[Helsfyr (station)|Helsfyr Station]].<ref name=h69>Halsrud: 69</ref> Immediately afterwards it ascends to ground level and continues to [[Brynseng (station)|Brynseng Station]]. In this intermediate section the line passes a maintenance of way depot and splits, with the Lambertseter Line receiving separate tracks at Brynseng.<ref name=h72>Halsrud: 72</ref> Both Helsfyr and Brynseng are the site of several large offices complexes.<ref name=h69 /><ref name=h72 />\n\n[[File:Mortensrud stasjon 18jun2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[T1000 train|T1000]] train at [[Mortensrud (station)|Mortensrud]], the line's terminus]]\nAt Brynseng lines continue concurrently across a bridge over the [[Trunk Line]] and then the [[Lambertseter Line]] branch off towards [[H\u00f8yenhall (station)|H\u00f8yenhall Station]]. The \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line continues to [[Hellerud (station)|Hellerud Station]], after which the [[Furuset Line]] branches off.

The V\u00e5lerenga Line was built and operated by [[Kristiania Sporveisselskab]] (KSS), which had opened the line on 3 May 1900.<ref>Aspenberg: 10</ref> Proposals for a link from Etterstad towards the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 area were first articulated in 1917. That year Aker Municipality established the municipal tramway company Akersbanerne to build [[light rail]]s to the Aker suburbs of Oslo.<ref name=lt32>{{cite journal |title=\u00d8stensj\u00f8\u2013B\u00e6rumsbanen 60 \u00e5r |last=Andersen |first=Bj\u00f8rn |year=1997 |volume=32 |pages=14\u201319 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Meanwhile, Aker and Oslo had issued a contest for a network of tramways throughout the urban area. The winning design, made by J\u00f8rgen Barth, included a series of suburban lines, including one to \u00d8stensj\u00f8.<ref>Haldsrud: 27</ref> This resulted in a municipal urban rail plan that was passed in 1919.<ref>Haldsrud: 28</ref>\n\nConstruction started in February 1922, and by 18 December 1923, construction had come far enough the {{convert|1.4|km|sp=us|adj=on}} section from Etterstad to Bryn could open. An agreement was made with KSS, where the latter extended its Line 17 from that operated on the [[Ullev\u00e5l Hageby Line|Homansbyen Line]] and the V\u00e5lerenga Line. Every other service was extended to Bryn and given the designation 7\u00d8.<ref name=\"lt32\"/> The original line was [[double track]] from Etterstadgata to the municipal border and [[single track (rail)|single track]] onwards. It is now known whether there was a balloon loop or not at Bryn. Double track to Bryn was completed in 1925.<ref>Haldsrud: 113</ref> Services were carried out with [[KES and KSS Class H|Class H]] trams. The ride cost 15 \u00f8re from V\u00e5lerenga to Bryn, and 30 \u00f8re onwards to the city center.<ref>Haldsrud: 115</ref> Trams ran every 24 minutes to Bryn.<ref name=h116>Haldsrud: 116</ref>\n\n===Tramway operations===\n[[File:Gullfisk-b1-203.jpg|thumb|Two [[Gullfisk|Class B]] trams at [[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler]] in 1962]]\nAkersbanerne continued construction on the section from Bryn to Oppsal. The original reason for terminating at Bryn had been the prolonged construction of Bryn Bridge across the Trunk Line.<ref name=h116 /> The extension to Oppsal was completed in January 1926. By then KSS had been taken over by Oslo Municipality and merged to become [[Oslo Sporveier]]. However, the two municipalities and their tram companies could not agree on terms to lease the trackage from Etterstad to the city center. Part of the problem was the lack of a suitable [[turning loop]] with free capacity in the city center. Instead, Akersbanerne decided to operate the trams to Etterstad, where there would be transfer, without transfer tickets, between the two tram companies. For the operations, Akersbanerne bought four [[BB Class A|Class A]] trams and three trailers, which were built by [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]] and delivered in 1926 and 1927. This was not sufficient to operate all the lines, so an addition [[Ekebergbanen rolling stock|three trams]] were leased from [[Ekebergbanen (company)|Ekebergbanen]].<ref name=lt32 />\n\nThe lack of direct routes to the city center was not popular among travelers, and a direct bus service from the area around [[Hellerud]] was introduced. These was taken over by Akersbanerne in 1928, who subcontracted the operations to [[De Bl\u00e5 Omnibusser]]. Later the concession was given to the bus company. New negotiations between the tram companies were carried out, but neither party was willing to make sufficient admittances for agreement to be reached. Akersbanerne merged its operation to the west of the city center with [[Holmenkolbanen]] in 1933, and the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was the only remaining service they operated. Akersbanerne started negotiating with both Ekebergbanen and B\u00e6rumsbanen about either of them taking over the route.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:Gullfisk suburban.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Gullfisk|Class B]] tram on the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line in 1947]]\nB\u00e6rumsbanen, that had become partially owned by Oslo Sporveier, had a similar suburban tramway to the east of the city center, the [[Lilleaker Line|Lilleaker]] and [[Kols\u00e5s Line]]s, where trams continued along street trams lines until the reached the city center. Also they had a lack of sufficient balloon loops. They turned their trams at [[Wessels plass|Athen\u00e6um]], and therefore did not serve the important [[Oslo East Station]]. An agreement was therefore reached with B\u00e6rumsbanen and Oslo Sporveier, where B\u00e6rumsbanen would operate a through service from [[Kols\u00e5s (station)|Kols\u00e5s]] to Oppsal, without the need to balloon loops in the city center. The service started on 4 January 1937 and was branded as the B\u00e6rum\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line.<ref name=lt32 />\n\nB\u00e6rumsbanen had a fleet of Class A trams, and these were along with Akersbanerne's units put into use on the combined service. The first [[Gullfisk|Class B]] trams were delivered to Oslo Sporveier in 1937, and these put into service on the B\u00e6rum\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line after the serial delivery started in 1939. They aluminum trams were faster and had better comfort, allowing a single tram could replace a Class A tram and trailer. The Kols\u00e5s Line was connected to the [[Common Tunnel]] from 15 June 1942 and became part of the underground service. The branch from [[Jar (station)|Jar]] to the city center was renamed the Lillaker Line and tram service cut short to Jar. The \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line service thereafter became marketed as the Lilleaker\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line. However, a limited number of services continued to [[Kols\u00e5s (station)|Kols\u00e5s]], [[Avl\u00f8s (station)|Avl\u00f8s]] or [[Haslum (station)|Haslum]].<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:SM-53 B\u00f8ler.jpg|thumb|[[SM53]] tram at [[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler]] in around 1960]]\nFrom 1944, the operative responsibility for B\u00e6rumbanen was taken over by Oslo Sporveier. The Lilleaker\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was then given the service number 9. The municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged in 1948, and the ownership of the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was transferred to B\u00e6rumsbanen. The remaining Class A trams were retired between 1946 and 1958 and replaced with Class E, very similar to Class B, but had been built as street trams in 1939. Class B trams were rebuilt from 1955 so they could operate in trains.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n===Conversion to metro===\nPlanning of the metro commenced in 1946. An overground system was ruled out because of the increased estimates in traffic and an underground route was instead pursued. This part of the line would need to handle a traffic of 20,000 passengers per hour.<ref name=\"h118\"/> Preliminary work on the line planning concluded in 1949 and instead a permanent municipal agency was established, the Planning Office For the Suburban and Underground Lines, on 15 September 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/tunnelbanekontoret.asp |title=Tunnelbanekontoret |author=Oslo City Archive |accessdate=22 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=28 June 2003 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628152336/http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/tunnelbanekontoret.asp}}</ref> Instrumental in the change of magnitude was the change of was a shift in the zoning planning. There was a large housing shortage in Oslo and the region was experiencing rapid population growth. The solution was to build a series of [[commuter town]]s in Aker, which would be the basis for the traffic on the metro. Plans for both a metro and new housing were substantiated in a 1950 municipal plan.<ref>Haldsrud: 37</ref>\n\n[[File:Oppsal trikk.jpg|thumb|left|[[SM53]] tram at [[Oppsal (station)|Oppsal]] shortly before the conversion to metro]]\nThe basics for the metro were established in 1951, with a common segment through Enerhaugen with a terminus at [[Gr\u00f8nlands torg]], to avoid having to cross [[Akerselva]]. The plans were made such that in the future the line could be extended to connect to Holmenkolbanen's western underground line at [[Nationaltheatret (station)|Nationalthatret]]. Four branches would be built, including the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line, would be converted to metro.<ref>Strandholt: 207</ref> The conversion and metro were approved by the city council on 9 December 1954.  Investments were estimated at 221 million [[Norwegian krone]], including rolling stock, for all four lines.<ref>Haldsrud: 42</ref> The \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line would retain its route from Bryn to Oppsal, but it would receive a new section from Bryn to T\u00f8yen, where it would run concurrently with the Lambertseter Line. Construction of the latter started in 1952 and was completed on 28 April 1957, sharing track from Etterstad to Bryn.<ref name=lt32 />\n\nThe metro project involved a significant extension of the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line. The first part of the extension was built as a tramway; work on the {{convert|1.4|km|sp=us|adj=on}} section to B\u00f8ler commenced in 1957. This included construction of the first tunnel on the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line and resulted in Oppsal Station being moved.<ref name=lt32 /> The tracks were rearranged at Brynseng where the Lambertseters Line's inbound track was placed under the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line's outbound track to avoid a level crossing. Between Brynseng and H\u00f8yenhall a four-track bridge was built over the Trunk Line.<ref name=h118>Haldsrud: 118</ref> The first revenue trams ran to B\u00f8ler from 20 July 1958. During parts the 1960s, the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was also served by Line 3.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:Bogerud T-bane.jpg|thumb|[[Bogerud (station)|Bogerud]] opened in 1967 as part of the new metro]]\nThe original metro plans had not called for the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line to run further than to B\u00f8ler. As housing development was gradually forcing its way further south in Nordstrand, the municipal council saw the need for extensions to the line. The section from B\u00f8ler to Borgerud was approved on 8 March 1963 and construction started immediately. The section from Borgerud to Skullerud was approved of on 31 January 1964. The total costs of the line from Helsfyr to Skullerud ended at 39 million [[Norwegian krone]].<ref name=h118 />\n\nWith the conversion to [[rapid transit|metro standard]], the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was converted to having [[third rail]] power supply, the [[railway platform|platform height]] was raised and the platforms lengthened to {{convert|110|m|sp=us}} to handle six-car trains. All [[level crossing]]s were removed.<ref>Aspenberg: 29</ref> The Lambertseter Line was the first line of the Oslo Metro when it opened on 22 May 1966. Instead of following the V\u00e5lerenga Line to the city center, it instead followed the Common Tunnel from [[Brynseng (station)|Brynseng]] to [[Jernbanetorget (station)|Jernbanetorget]]. From 19 June 1967 Line 3 stopped being linked with the Lilleaker Line and only ran to Jernbanetorget. The line was closed during the evening of 25 October. From 28 October 1967, the line was connected to the metro and [[OS T1000|T1000]] started being used on the service. The three days were used to remove the balloon loop at B\u00f8ler and connect the line to the Common Tunnel. The extension from B\u00f8ler to Skullerud opened on 26 November 1967.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:B\u00f8ler T-bane.JPG|thumb|left|[[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler Station]] has seen its original ticket office converted to a [[Narvesen]] kiosk]]\n\n===Metro operations===\n\nServices on the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line were carried out by Line 3, originally running from Skullerud to [[Jernbanetorget (station)|Jernbanetorget]] in the city center.<ref name=h195>Haldsrud: 195</ref> The fourth line of the metro was the Furuset Line.

This unmanning of the station allowed for a significant cut in operating costs.<ref>Haldsrud: 153</ref> The [[Sognsvann Line]] was converted to a metro line from 8 April 1995, allowing Line 3 to continue onwards to [[Ullev\u00e5l stadion (station)|Ullev\u00e5l stadion]] from that date.<ref name=h195 />\n\nThe line has received one extension after the metro conversion. Additional housing in the [[Mortensrud]] area resulted in plans to a metro connection to the area. Also the Lambertseter Line was considered to be extended to the area, but the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was eventually landed upon. Initial plans called for construction to commence in 1992 and be completed in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |title=Millioner l\u00f8ser trafikkflokene |last=Grue |first=\u00d8ystein |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=24 February 1992 |page=15}}</ref> However, construction did not start until 1995.

Services were variously provided by [[Kristiania Sporveisselskab]], [[B\u00e6rumsbanen]] and [[Oslo Sporveier]]. Proposals for making the line part of the metro arose in the late 1940s and the system was approved in 1956. This materialized in an extension of the line to [[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler]] on 20 July 1958. The \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line became the third line of the metro on 26 November 1967, the same day the line was extended to Skullerud. The last extension, to Mortensrud, commenced services on 24 November 1997. There are proposals to extend the line further south to [[Bj\u00f8rndal]] and [[Gjersrud]].\n\n==Route==\n[[File:3 Mortensrud - Brynseng T - 2013-01-20 at 13-11-25.jpg|thumb|left|[[MX3000]] near [[Brynseng (station)|Brynseng]], where the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line runs next to the [[Lambertseter Line]] (right)]]\nThe \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line runs from T\u00f8yen on the [[Common Tunnel]] to Mortensrud, a distance of {{convert|9.0|km|sp=us}}.

The V\u00e5lerenga Line was built and operated by [[Kristiania Sporveisselskab]] (KSS), which had opened the line on 3 May 1900.<ref>Aspenberg: 10</ref> Proposals for a link from Etterstad towards the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 area were first articulated in 1917. That year Aker Municipality established the municipal tramway company Akersbanerne to build [[light rail]]s to the Aker suburbs of Oslo.<ref name=lt32>{{cite journal |title=\u00d8stensj\u00f8\u2013B\u00e6rumsbanen 60 \u00e5r |last=Andersen |first=Bj\u00f8rn |year=1997 |volume=32 |pages=14\u201319 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Meanwhile, Aker and Oslo had issued a contest for a network of tramways throughout the urban area. The winning design, made by J\u00f8rgen Barth, included a series of suburban lines, including one to \u00d8stensj\u00f8.<ref>Haldsrud: 27</ref> This resulted in a municipal urban rail plan that was passed in 1919.<ref>Haldsrud: 28</ref>\n\nConstruction started in February 1922, and by 18 December 1923, construction had come far enough the {{convert|1.4|km|sp=us|adj=on}} section from Etterstad to Bryn could open. An agreement was made with KSS, where the latter extended its Line 17 from that operated on the [[Ullev\u00e5l Hageby Line|Homansbyen Line]] and the V\u00e5lerenga Line. Every other service was extended to Bryn and given the designation 7\u00d8.<ref name=\"lt32\"/> The original line was [[double track]] from Etterstadgata to the municipal border and [[single track (rail)|single track]] onwards. It is now known whether there was a balloon loop or not at Bryn. Double track to Bryn was completed in 1925.<ref>Haldsrud: 113</ref> Services were carried out with [[KES and KSS Class H|Class H]] trams. The ride cost 15 \u00f8re from V\u00e5lerenga to Bryn, and 30 \u00f8re onwards to the city center.<ref>Haldsrud: 115</ref> Trams ran every 24 minutes to Bryn.<ref name=h116>Haldsrud: 116</ref>\n\n===Tramway operations===\n[[File:Gullfisk-b1-203.jpg|thumb|Two [[Gullfisk|Class B]] trams at [[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler]] in 1962]]\nAkersbanerne continued construction on the section from Bryn to Oppsal. The original reason for terminating at Bryn had been the prolonged construction of Bryn Bridge across the Trunk Line.<ref name=h116 /> The extension to Oppsal was completed in January 1926. By then KSS had been taken over by Oslo Municipality and merged to become [[Oslo Sporveier]]. However, the two municipalities and their tram companies could not agree on terms to lease the trackage from Etterstad to the city center. Part of the problem was the lack of a suitable [[turning loop]] with free capacity in the city center. Instead, Akersbanerne decided to operate the trams to Etterstad, where there would be transfer, without transfer tickets, between the two tram companies. For the operations, Akersbanerne bought four [[BB Class A|Class A]] trams and three trailers, which were built by [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]] and delivered in 1926 and 1927. This was not sufficient to operate all the lines, so an addition [[Ekebergbanen rolling stock|three trams]] were leased from [[Ekebergbanen (company)|Ekebergbanen]].<ref name=lt32 />\n\nThe lack of direct routes to the city center was not popular among travelers, and a direct bus service from the area around [[Hellerud]] was introduced. These was taken over by Akersbanerne in 1928, who subcontracted the operations to [[De Bl\u00e5 Omnibusser]]. Later the concession was given to the bus company. New negotiations between the tram companies were carried out, but neither party was willing to make sufficient admittances for agreement to be reached. Akersbanerne merged its operation to the west of the city center with [[Holmenkolbanen]] in 1933, and the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was the only remaining service they operated. Akersbanerne started negotiating with both Ekebergbanen and B\u00e6rumsbanen about either of them taking over the route.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:Gullfisk suburban.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Gullfisk|Class B]] tram on the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line in 1947]]\nB\u00e6rumsbanen, that had become partially owned by Oslo Sporveier, had a similar suburban tramway to the east of the city center, the [[Lilleaker Line|Lilleaker]] and [[Kols\u00e5s Line]]s, where trams continued along street trams lines until the reached the city center. Also they had a lack of sufficient balloon loops. They turned their trams at [[Wessels plass|Athen\u00e6um]], and therefore did not serve the important [[Oslo East Station]]. An agreement was therefore reached with B\u00e6rumsbanen and Oslo Sporveier, where B\u00e6rumsbanen would operate a through service from [[Kols\u00e5s (station)|Kols\u00e5s]] to Oppsal, without the need to balloon loops in the city center. The service started on 4 January 1937 and was branded as the B\u00e6rum\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line.<ref name=lt32 />\n\nB\u00e6rumsbanen had a fleet of Class A trams, and these were along with Akersbanerne's units put into use on the combined service. The first [[Gullfisk|Class B]] trams were delivered to Oslo Sporveier in 1937, and these put into service on the B\u00e6rum\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line after the serial delivery started in 1939. They aluminum trams were faster and had better comfort, allowing a single tram could replace a Class A tram and trailer. The Kols\u00e5s Line was connected to the [[Common Tunnel]] from 15 June 1942 and became part of the underground service. The branch from [[Jar (station)|Jar]] to the city center was renamed the Lillaker Line and tram service cut short to Jar. The \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line service thereafter became marketed as the Lilleaker\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line. However, a limited number of services continued to [[Kols\u00e5s (station)|Kols\u00e5s]], [[Avl\u00f8s (station)|Avl\u00f8s]] or [[Haslum (station)|Haslum]].<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:SM-53 B\u00f8ler.jpg|thumb|[[SM53]] tram at [[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler]] in around 1960]]\nFrom 1944, the operative responsibility for B\u00e6rumbanen was taken over by Oslo Sporveier. The Lilleaker\u2013\u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was then given the service number 9. The municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged in 1948, and the ownership of the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was transferred to B\u00e6rumsbanen. The remaining Class A trams were retired between 1946 and 1958 and replaced with Class E, very similar to Class B, but had been built as street trams in 1939. Class B trams were rebuilt from 1955 so they could operate in trains.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n===Conversion to metro===\nPlanning of the metro commenced in 1946. An overground system was ruled out because of the increased estimates in traffic and an underground route was instead pursued. This part of the line would need to handle a traffic of 20,000 passengers per hour.<ref name=\"h118\"/> Preliminary work on the line planning concluded in 1949 and instead a permanent municipal agency was established, the Planning Office For the Suburban and Underground Lines, on 15 September 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/tunnelbanekontoret.asp |title=Tunnelbanekontoret |author=Oslo City Archive |accessdate=22 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=28 June 2003 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628152336/http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/tunnelbanekontoret.asp}}</ref> Instrumental in the change of magnitude was the change of was a shift in the zoning planning. There was a large housing shortage in Oslo and the region was experiencing rapid population growth. The solution was to build a series of [[commuter town]]s in Aker, which would be the basis for the traffic on the metro. Plans for both a metro and new housing were substantiated in a 1950 municipal plan.<ref>Haldsrud: 37</ref>\n\n[[File:Oppsal trikk.jpg|thumb|left|[[SM53]] tram at [[Oppsal (station)|Oppsal]] shortly before the conversion to metro]]\nThe basics for the metro were established in 1951, with a common segment through Enerhaugen with a terminus at [[Gr\u00f8nlands torg]], to avoid having to cross [[Akerselva]]. The plans were made such that in the future the line could be extended to connect to Holmenkolbanen's western underground line at [[Nationaltheatret (station)|Nationalthatret]]. Four branches would be built, including the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line, would be converted to metro.<ref>Strandholt: 207</ref> The conversion and metro were approved by the city council on 9 December 1954.  Investments were estimated at 221 million [[Norwegian krone]], including rolling stock, for all four lines.<ref>Haldsrud: 42</ref> The \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line would retain its route from Bryn to Oppsal, but it would receive a new section from Bryn to T\u00f8yen, where it would run concurrently with the Lambertseter Line. Construction of the latter started in 1952 and was completed on 28 April 1957, sharing track from Etterstad to Bryn.<ref name=lt32 />\n\nThe metro project involved a significant extension of the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line. The first part of the extension was built as a tramway; work on the {{convert|1.4|km|sp=us|adj=on}} section to B\u00f8ler commenced in 1957. This included construction of the first tunnel on the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line and resulted in Oppsal Station being moved.<ref name=lt32 /> The tracks were rearranged at Brynseng where the Lambertseters Line's inbound track was placed under the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line's outbound track to avoid a level crossing. Between Brynseng and H\u00f8yenhall a four-track bridge was built over the Trunk Line.<ref name=h118>Haldsrud: 118</ref> The first revenue trams ran to B\u00f8ler from 20 July 1958. During parts the 1960s, the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was also served by Line 3.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:Bogerud T-bane.jpg|thumb|[[Bogerud (station)|Bogerud]] opened in 1967 as part of the new metro]]\nThe original metro plans had not called for the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line to run further than to B\u00f8ler. As housing development was gradually forcing its way further south in Nordstrand, the municipal council saw the need for extensions to the line. The section from B\u00f8ler to Borgerud was approved on 8 March 1963 and construction started immediately. The section from Borgerud to Skullerud was approved of on 31 January 1964. The total costs of the line from Helsfyr to Skullerud ended at 39 million [[Norwegian krone]].<ref name=h118 />\n\nWith the conversion to [[rapid transit|metro standard]], the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was converted to having [[third rail]] power supply, the [[railway platform|platform height]] was raised and the platforms lengthened to {{convert|110|m|sp=us}} to handle six-car trains. All [[level crossing]]s were removed.<ref>Aspenberg: 29</ref> The Lambertseter Line was the first line of the Oslo Metro when it opened on 22 May 1966. Instead of following the V\u00e5lerenga Line to the city center, it instead followed the Common Tunnel from [[Brynseng (station)|Brynseng]] to [[Jernbanetorget (station)|Jernbanetorget]]. From 19 June 1967 Line 3 stopped being linked with the Lilleaker Line and only ran to Jernbanetorget. The line was closed during the evening of 25 October. From 28 October 1967, the line was connected to the metro and [[OS T1000|T1000]] started being used on the service. The three days were used to remove the balloon loop at B\u00f8ler and connect the line to the Common Tunnel. The extension from B\u00f8ler to Skullerud opened on 26 November 1967.<ref name=lt32 />\n\n[[File:B\u00f8ler T-bane.JPG|thumb|left|[[B\u00f8ler (station)|B\u00f8ler Station]] has seen its original ticket office converted to a [[Narvesen]] kiosk]]\n\n===Metro operations===\n\nServices on the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line were carried out by Line 3, originally running from Skullerud to [[Jernbanetorget (station)|Jernbanetorget]] in the city center.<ref name=h195>Haldsrud: 195</ref> The fourth line of the metro was the Furuset Line.

Additional housing in the [[Mortensrud]] area resulted in plans to a metro connection to the area. Also the Lambertseter Line was considered to be extended to the area, but the \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Line was eventually landed upon. Initial plans called for construction to commence in 1992 and be completed in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |title=Millioner l\u00f8ser trafikkflokene |last=Grue |first=\u00d8ystein |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=24 February 1992 |page=15}}</ref> However, construction did not start until 1995.
