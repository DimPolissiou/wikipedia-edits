[[Nazi]] politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Vienna]], [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]], and [[First Vienna FC]], to join the all-German team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons. In the 1938 World Cup that began on 4 June, this \"united\" German team managed only a 1\u20131 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2\u20134 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris, France. That early exit stands as Germany's worst World Cup result, and one of just two occasions the team failed to progress the group stage (the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament).\n\nDuring World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942. National team games were then suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as ''Rote J\u00e4ger'' through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.\n\n=== Three German national teams (1945\u20131990) ===\nAfter World War II, Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950.

With recognition by FIFA and UEFA, the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team.

It sent [[Saarland national football team|their own team]] to the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and to the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification|1954 World Cup qualifiers]]. In 1957, Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nIn 1949, the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) was founded. In 1952 the ''[[Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Verband der DDR]]'' (DFV) was established and the [[East Germany national football team]] took to the field. They were the only team to beat the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation.

In 1964, [[Helmut Sch\u00f6n]] took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.\n\nIn the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], West Germany reached the final after beating the [[USSR national football team|USSR]] in the semi-final, facing hosts [[England national football team|England]].

[[Nazi]] politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Vienna]], [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]], and [[First Vienna FC]], to join the all-German team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons. In the 1938 World Cup that began on 4 June, this \"united\" German team managed only a 1\u20131 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2\u20134 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris, France. That early exit stands as Germany's worst World Cup result, and one of just two occasions the team failed to progress the group stage (the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament).\n\nDuring World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942. National team games were then suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as ''Rote J\u00e4ger'' through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.\n\n=== Three German national teams (1945\u20131990) ===\nAfter World War II, Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950.

It sent [[Saarland national football team|their own team]] to the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and to the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification|1954 World Cup qualifiers]]. In 1957, Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nIn 1949, the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) was founded. In 1952 the ''[[Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Verband der DDR]]'' (DFV) was established and the [[East Germany national football team]] took to the field. They were the only team to beat the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation.

Until the later part of his life, this isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, \"forced to become original\".{{efn|Haydn made the remark to his friend and biographer [[Georg August Griesinger]]; cited from English version by Vernon Gotwals {{harv|Griesinger|1963|p=17}}}} Yet his music circulated widely, and for much of his career he was the most celebrated composer in Europe.\n\nHe was a [[Haydn and Mozart|friend and mentor of]] [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], a [[Beethoven and his contemporaries#Joseph Haydn|tutor of]] [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and the older brother of composer [[Michael Haydn]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:KapellhausStStephensVienna.PNG|thumb|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]]. In the foreground is the Kapellhaus (demolished 1804) where Haydn lived as a chorister.]]\nJoseph Haydn was born in [[Rohrau, Austria|Rohrau]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], a village that at that time stood on the border with [[Hungary]]. His father was [[Mathias Haydn]], a [[wheelwright]] who also served as \"Marktrichter\", an office akin to village mayor. Haydn's mother Maria, {{n\u00e9e}} Koller, had previously worked as a cook in the palace of [[Aloys Thomas Raimund, Count Harrach|Count Harrach]], the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Neither parent could read music;{{efn|Haydn reported this in his 1776 [[Autobiographical sketch (Haydn)|Autobiographical sketch]].}} however, Mathias was an enthusiastic [[folk music]]ian, who during the [[journeyman]] period of his career had taught himself to play the [[harp]]. According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his childhood family was extremely musical, and frequently sang together and with their neighbours.<ref>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|pp=80\u201381}}).}}</ref>\n\nHaydn's parents had noticed that their son was musically gifted and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain serious musical training. It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in [[Hainburg an der Donau|Hainburg]], that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician. Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg and he never again lived with his parents.\n\nLife in the Frankh household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry<ref>{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=9}}</ref> and humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing.<ref>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=82}}).}}</ref> He began his musical training there, and could soon play both [[harpsichord]] and [[violin]]. The people of Hainburg heard him sing [[Boy soprano|treble]] parts in the church [[choir]].\n\nThere is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739{{efn|{{Harvnb|Finscher|2000|p=12}}. [[David Wyn Jones|Jones]] (2009:7){{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019|reason=2009a or 2009b?}} dates the visit to early summer, i.e. cherry season, since during the visit Reutter plied the child with fresh cherries as a means of inducing him to learn to sing a trill.}} he was brought to the attention of [[Georg von Reutter]], the director of music in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna, who happened to be visiting Hainburg and was looking for new choirboys. Haydn passed his audition with Reutter, and after several months of further training moved to Vienna (1740), where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister.\n\nHaydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter's family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother [[Michael Haydn|Michael]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones2009a|pp=12\u201313}}. A third brother, [[Johann Evangelist Haydn]], also pursued a musical career as a tenor, but achieved no distinction and was for some time supported by Joseph.</ref> The choirboys were instructed in Latin and other school subjects as well as voice, violin, and keyboard.<ref>{{Harvnb|Finscher|2000|p=12}}</ref> Reutter was of little help to Haydn in the areas of [[music theory]] and composition, giving him only two lessons in his entire time as chorister.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=10}}</ref> However, since St. Stephen's was one of the leading musical centres in Europe, Haydn learned a great deal simply by serving as a professional musician there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Landon|Jones|1988|p=27}}</ref>\n\nLike Frankh before him, Reutter did not always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed. As he later told his biographer [[Albert Christoph Dies]], Haydn was motivated to sing well, in hopes of gaining more invitations to perform before aristocratic audiences\u2014where the singers were usually served refreshments.<ref>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=87}}).}}</ref>\n\n[[File:WhereHaydnLived.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map showing [[List of residences of Joseph Haydn|locations where Haydn lived]] or visited)]]\n\n=== Struggles as a freelancer ===\nBy 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts. Empress [[Maria Theresa]] herself complained to Reutter about his singing, calling it \"crowing\".<ref name=Dies1810_89>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=89}}).}}</ref> One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister.{{r|Dies1810_89}} This was enough for Reutter: Haydn was first [[Caning|caned]], then summarily dismissed and sent into the streets.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=27}}</ref> He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler, who shared his family's crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months. Haydn immediately began his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician.\n\n[[File:Doln\u00ed Lukavice castle 01.JPG|thumb|[[The Morzin palace in Doln\u00ed Lukavice]], Czech Republic|280x280px]]\nHaydn struggled at first, working at many different jobs: as a music teacher, as a street serenader, and eventually, in 1752, as valet\u2013accompanist for the Italian composer [[Nicola Porpora]], from whom he later said he learned \"the true fundamentals of composition\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Larsen|1980|p=8}}</ref> He was also briefly in [[Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz]]'s employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the [[Judenplatz]].<ref>[[Rita Steblin]], \"Haydns Orgeldienste 'in der damaligen Gr\u00e4fl.

As a remedy, he worked his way through the [[counterpoint]] exercises in the text ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' by [[Johann Joseph Fux]] and carefully studied the work of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], whom he later acknowledged as an important influence.<ref name=\"Geiringer30\">{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=30}}</ref> As his skills increased, Haydn began to acquire a public reputation, first as the composer of an opera, ''[[Der krumme Teufel]]'', \"The Limping Devil\", written for the comic actor [[Johann Joseph Felix Kurz]], whose stage name was \"Bernardon\".

Haydn's job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterh\u00e1zy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister [[Gregor Werner]] retaining authority only for church music. When Werner died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister.{{anchor|Guttenbrunn}}\n\nAs a \"house officer\" in the Esterh\u00e1zy establishment, Haydn wore [[livery]] and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the family's ancestral seat [[Schloss Esterh\u00e1zy]] in [[Eisenstadt|Kismarton]] ''(today Eisenstadt, Austria)'' and later on [[Esterh\u00e1za]], a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s. Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing [[chamber music]] for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions. Despite this backbreaking workload,{{efn|[[H. C. Robbins Landon|Robbins Landon]] and [[David Wyn Jones|Jones]] (1988, 100) write: \"Haydn's duties were crushing. We can notice the effect in his handwriting, which becomes hastier as the 1770s turn to the 1780s: the notation starts to become ever more careless in the scores and the abbreviations multiply.\"}} the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn.{{sfn|Webster|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|Landon|Jones|1988|p=37}} The Esterh\u00e1zy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762\u20131790 [[Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy|Nikolaus I]]) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra. During the nearly thirty years that Haydn worked at the Esterh\u00e1zy court, he produced a flood of compositions, and his musical style continued to develop.\n[[File:Nikolaus Esterhazy.jpg|thumb|left|Prince [[Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy]], Haydn's most important patron]]\n\nMuch of Haydn's activity at the time followed the musical taste of his patron Prince Nikolaus. In about 1765, the prince obtained and began to learn to play the [[baryton]], an uncommon musical instrument similar to the bass [[viol]], but with a set of plucked sympathetic strings. Haydn was commanded to provide music for the prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, the most notable of which are the 126 [[Baryton trios (Haydn)|baryton trios]]. Around 1775, the prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theater the prince had built at Esterh\u00e1za came to host a major season, with multiple productions each year. Haydn served as company director, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances. He wrote [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn#Composed during Haydn's service for the Eszterh\u00e1zy family|several of the operas performed]] and wrote substitution [[aria]]s to insert into the operas of other composers.\n\n1779 was a watershed year for Haydn, as his contract was renegotiated: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterh\u00e1zy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers. Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign. His new employment contract \"acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn's career, the achievement of international popularity. By 1790 Haydn was in the paradoxical position ... of being Europe's leading composer, but someone who spent his time as a duty-bound Kapellmeister in a remote palace in the Hungarian countryside.\"{{sfn|Jones|2009b|p=136}} The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op. [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|33]], [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)|50]], 54/55, and [[String Quartets, Op. 64 (Haydn)|64]]). Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the [[Paris symphonies]] (1785\u20131786) and the original orchestral version of ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ (Haydn)|The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'' (1786), a commission from [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain.\n[[File:Fert\u0151d - The Eszterh\u00e1zy Castle or Palace.jpg|thumb|250px|View of [[Eszterh\u00e1za]]]]\n\nThe remoteness of Esterh\u00e1za, which was farther from Vienna than Kismarton, led Haydn gradually to feel more isolated and lonely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=60}}</ref> He longed to visit Vienna because of his friendships there.<ref>For details see {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|loc=Chapter 6}}</ref> Of these, a particularly important one was with [[Maria Anna von Genzinger]] (1754\u20131793), the wife of Prince Nikolaus's personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic relationship with the composer in 1789. Haydn wrote to Mrs. Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterh\u00e1za and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in Vienna. Later on, Haydn wrote to her frequently from London. Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his [[Variations in F minor|F minor variations]] for piano, Hob. XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=316}}, citing Robbins Landon.</ref>\n\nAnother friend in Vienna was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whom [[Haydn and Mozart|Haydn had met]] sometime around 1784.

Following a trend of the time,{{sfn|Jones|2009a}} Anton sought to economize by dismissing most of the court musicians. Haydn retained a nominal appointment with Anton, at a reduced salary of 400 florins, as well as a 1000-florin pension from Nikolaus.<ref>Geiringer (1982, 96)</ref> Since Anton had little need of Haydn's services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from [[Johann Peter Salomon]], a German violinist and  [[impresario]], to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra.\n\nThe choice was a sensible one because Haydn was already a very popular composer there. Since the death of [[Johann Christian Bach]] in 1782, Haydn's music had dominated the concert scene in London; \"hardly a concert did not feature a work by him\".<ref name=\"Jones2009b_325\">{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=325}}.</ref> Haydn's work was widely distributed by publishers in London, including Forster (who had their own contract with Haydn) and Longman & [[Robert Broderip|Broderip]] (who served as agent in England for Haydn's Vienna publisher [[Artaria]]).{{r|Jones2009b_325}} Efforts to bring Haydn to London had been undertaken since 1782, though Haydn's loyalty to Prince Nikolaus had prevented him from accepting.{{r|Jones2009b_325}}\n\nAfter fond farewells from Mozart and other friends,<ref>For narratives of Haydn's last days in Mozart's company, see [[Haydn and Mozart]]</ref> Haydn departed Vienna with Salomon on 15 December 1790, arriving in [[Calais]] in time to cross the English Channel on New Year's Day of 1791. It was the first time that the 58-year-old composer had seen the ocean. Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in Great Pulteney Street (London, near [[Piccadilly Circus]])<ref name=\"Jones2009b_137\">{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=137}}</ref> working in a borrowed studio at the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]] piano firm nearby.{{r|Jones2009b_137}}\n\nIt was the start of a very auspicious period for Haydn; both the 1791\u20131792 journey, along with a repeat visit in 1794\u20131795, were greatly successful. Audiences flocked to Haydn's concerts; he augmented his fame and made large profits, thus becoming financially secure.{{efn|According to [[David Wyn Jones|Jones]], the London visits yielded a net profit of 15,000 florins. Haydn continued to prosper after the visits and at his death left an estate valued at 55,713 florins. These were substantial sums; for comparison, the house he bought in Gumpendorf in 1793 (and then remodeled) cost only 1370 florins (all figures from Jones 2009:144\u2013146).}} [[Charles Burney]] reviewed the first concert thus: \"Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England.\"{{efn|From Burney's memoirs; quoted from {{Harvtxt|Landon|Jones|1988|p=234}}}} Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with [[Rebecca Schroeter]].\n[[File:Hanover-Square-Rooms.png|thumb|The [[Hanover Square Rooms]], principal venue of Haydn's performances in London|left|240x240px]]\n\nMusically, Haydn's visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the ''[[Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)|Surprise]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 100 (Haydn)|Military]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 103 (Haydn)|Drumroll]]'' and ''[[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|London]]'' symphonies; the ''Rider'' quartet; and the [[Piano Trio No. 39 (Haydn)|\"Gypsy Rondo\"]] piano trio. The great success of the overall enterprise does not mean that the journeys were free of trouble. Notably, his very first project, the commissioned opera ''[[L'anima del filosofo]]'' was duly written during the early stages of the trip, but the opera's impresario [[John Gallini]] was unable to obtain a license to permit opera performances in the theater he directed, the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]]. Haydn was well paid for the opera (\u00a3300) but much time was wasted.{{efn|The premier performance did not take place until 1951, during the [[Florence May Festival]]. [[Maria Callas]] sang the role of Euridice. The opera and its history are discussed in {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}.}} Thus only two new symphonies, [[Symphony No. 95 (Haydn)|no. 95]] and [[Symphony No. 96 (Haydn)|no. 96 ''Miracle'']], could be premiered in the 12 concerts of Salomon's spring concert series. Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the [[Professional Concerts]], who recruited Haydn's old pupil [[Ignaz Pleyel]] as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other's symphonies on their concert programs.\n\nThe end of Salomon's series in June gave Haydn a rare period of relative leisure. He spent some of the time in the country ([[Hertingfordbury]]), but also had time to travel, notably to Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University. The symphony performed for the occasion, [[Symphony No. 92 (Haydn)|no. 92]] has since come to be known as the ''Oxford Symphony'', although it had been written in 1789.<ref>\"Oxford Symphony'', article by Jane Holland in Jones (2009b:266)</ref>\n\n[[File:Franz Joseph Haydn 1732-1809 by John Hoppner 1791.jpg|thumb|195px|Haydn as portrayed by [[John Hoppner]] in England in 1791]]\nWhile traveling to London in 1790, Haydn had met the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in his native city of [[Bonn]]. On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and [[Beethoven and his contemporaries#Joseph Haydn|was Haydn's pupil]] up until the second London journey. Haydn took Beethoven with him to [[Eisenstadt]] for the summer, where Haydn had little to do, and taught Beethoven some [[counterpoint]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Geiringer|1982|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref> While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodeling it. He also arranged for the performance of some of his London symphonies in local concerts.\n\nBy the time he arrived on his second journey to England, (1794\u20131795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene. The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon's ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts. The concerts included the premieres of the 99th, 100th, and 101st symphonies. For 1795, Salomon had abandoned his own series, citing difficulty in obtaining \"vocal performers of the first rank from abroad\", and Haydn joined forces with the Opera Concerts, headed by the violinist [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]]. These were the venue of the last three symphonies, 102, 103, and 104. The final benefit concert for Haydn (\"Dr. Haydn's night\") at the end of the 1795 season was a great success and was perhaps the peak of his English career. Haydn's biographer [[Georg August Griesinger|Griesinger]] wrote that Haydn \"considered the days spent in England the happiest of his life. He was everywhere appreciated there; it opened a new world to him\".{{sfn|Webster|2002|p=37}}\n\n=== Years of celebrity in Vienna ===\nHaydn returned to Vienna in 1795. Prince Anton had died, and his successor [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Nikolaus II]] proposed that the Esterh\u00e1zy musical establishment be revived with Haydn serving again as Kapellmeister. Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis. He spent his summers with the Esterh\u00e1zys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn|masses]] for them.\n\n[[File:Haydn by Thaler Wien SAM 350 2.jpg|thumb|210px|Wax sculpture of Haydn by Franz Thaler, c. 1800|right]]\nBy this time Haydn had become a public figure in Vienna. He spent most of his time in his home, a large house in the suburb of Windm\u00fchle,{{efn|The house, at Haydngasse 19, has since 1899 been a Haydn museum ([http://www.planetware.com/vienna/haydn-museum-a-w-hayd.htm 16 Top-Rated Museums and Art Galleries in Vienna \u2013 16. Haydn House] by Bryan Dearsley; [http://www.wienmuseum.at/de/standorte/haydnhaus.html Haydnhaus], [[Vienna Museum]]).}} and wrote works for public performance. In collaboration with his librettist and mentor [[Gottfried van Swieten]], and with funding from van Swieten's [[Gesellschaft der Associierten]], he composed his two great oratorios, ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801). Both were enthusiastically received. Haydn frequently appeared before the public, often leading performances of ''The Creation'' and ''The Seasons'' for charity benefits, including [[Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t]] programs with massed musical forces. He also composed instrumental music: the popular ''[[Trumpet Concerto (Haydn)|Trumpet Concerto]]'', and the last nine in his long series of string quartets, including the ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 2 (\"Fifths\")|Fifths]]'', ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 3 (\"Emperor\")|Emperor]]'', and ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 4 (\"Sunrise\")|Sunrise]]''. Directly inspired by hearing audiences sing [[God Save the King]] in London, in 1797 Haydn wrote a patriotic \"Emperor's Hymn\" [[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]], (\"God Save Emperor Francis\"). This achieved great success and became \"the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War\" (Jones){{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}. The melody was used for von Fallersleben's ''[[Deutschlandlied]]'' (1841), which was written as part of the German unification movement and whose third stanza is today the [[national anthem]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. (Modern Austria uses an anthem with music by Mozart.)\n\nDuring the later years of this successful period, Haydn faced incipient old age and fluctuating health, and he had to struggle to complete his final works. His last major work, from 1802, was the sixth mass for the Esterh\u00e1zys, the ''[[Harmoniemesse]]''.\n\n===Retirement, illness, and death===\nBy the end of 1803, Haydn's condition had declined to the point that he became physically unable to compose. He suffered from weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate and painfully swollen legs. Since diagnosis was uncertain in Haydn's time, it is unlikely that the precise illness can ever be identified, though [[David Wyn Jones|Jones]] suggests [[arteriosclerosis]].<ref>For symptoms see {{harvnb|Jones|2009a|p=146}}; for the arteriosclerosis hypothesis see {{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=216}}.</ref> The illness was especially hard for Haydn because the flow of fresh musical ideas continued unabated, although he could no longer work them out as compositions.{{efn|Of Haydn's plight, {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}} wrote, \"The last years of Haydn's life, with all his success, comfort, and celebrity, are among the saddest in music. More moving than the false pathos of a [[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart#Funeral|pauper's grave for Mozart]] ... is the figure of Haydn filled with musical ideas which were struggling to escape, as he himself said; he was too old and weak to go to the piano and submit to the discipline of working them out.\"}} His biographer Dies reported Haydn saying in 1806:\n\n<blockquote>\"I must have something to do\u2014usually musical ideas are pursuing me, to the point of torture, I cannot escape them, they stand like walls before me. If it's an [[allegro (music)|allegro]] that pursues me, my pulse keeps beating faster, I can get no sleep. If it's an [[Adagio (music)|adagio]], then I notice my pulse beating slowly. My imagination plays on me as if I were a clavier.\"{{efn|\"Clavier\" in the original German is ambiguous; literally \"keyboard\", it is used by extension to denote a keyboard instrument such as the piano or harpsichord. {{harvnb|Dies|1810|p=141}}.}} Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said \"I am really just a living clavier.\"</blockquote>\n\n[[File:HaydnsHouseInVienna.PNG|thumb|left|200px|The house in Vienna (now [[Vienna Museum#Haydn House|a museum]]) where Haydn spent the last years of his life]]\nThe winding down of Haydn's career was gradual.

As debility set in, he made largely futile efforts at composition, attempting to revise a rediscovered ''[[Missa brevis (Haydn)|Missa brevis]]'' from his teenage years and complete his [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn#Opus 103|final string quartet]]. The latter project was abandoned for good in 1805, and the quartet was published with just two movements.{{sfn|Jones|2009a|p=213}}\n\nHaydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honors during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him.<ref>{{harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=198}} gives the testimony of Haydn's early biographer [[Giuseppe Carpani]].</ref> During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his \"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser|Emperor's Hymn]]\". A final triumph occurred on 27 March 1808 when a performance of ''The Creation'' was organized in his honour. The very frail composer was brought into the hall on an armchair to the sound of trumpets and drums and was greeted by Beethoven, [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] (who led the performance) and by other musicians and members of the aristocracy<!--Speculation?: , many of whom probably sensed that they were saying goodbye to the elderly composer-->.

The image is taken from the 1900 edition of ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; it does not identify the work in question.}}]]\n\n[[James Webster (musicologist)|James Webster]] writes of Haydn's public character thus: \"Haydn's public life exemplified the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideal of the ''honn\u00eate homme'' (''honest man''): the man whose good character and worldly success enable and justify each other. His modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged. These traits were not only prerequisites to his success as [[Kapellmeister]], entrepreneur and public figure, but also aided the favorable reception of his music.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=44}}. These same traits, and his connection to the aristocracy contributed to the decline in his reputation in the nineteenth century: {{Harvnb|Proksch|2015}}</ref> Haydn was especially respected by the Esterh\u00e1zy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer; see [[Papa Haydn]] and the tale of the [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|\"Farewell\" Symphony]]. Haydn had a robust sense of humor, evident in his love of practical jokes<ref>{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|pp=92\u201393}}).}}</ref> and often apparent in his music, and he had many friends. For much of his life he benefited from a \"happy and naturally cheerful temperament\",<ref>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=91}}).}}</ref> but in his later life, there is evidence for periods of depression, notably in the correspondence with [[Maria Anna von Genzinger|Mrs. Genzinger]] and in Dies's biography, based on visits made in Haydn's old age.\n\nHaydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his [[rosary]] when he had trouble composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=54}}</ref> He normally began the manuscript of each composition with \"in nomine Domini\" (\"in the name of the Lord\") and ended with \"Laus Deo\" (\"praise be to God\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Larsen|1980|p=81}}</ref>\n\nHaydn's early years of poverty and awareness of the financial precariousness of musical life made him astute and even sharp in his business dealings. Some contemporaries (usually, it has to be said, wealthy ones) were surprised and even shocked at this. Webster writes: \"As regards money, Haydn\u2026always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterh\u00e1zy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over [to publishers in different countries]; he regularly engaged in 'sharp practice'\u201d which nowadays might be regarded as plain fraud.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[New Grove]]'', online edition, \"Haydn, Joseph\", section 6</ref> But those were days when copyright was in its infancy, and the pirating of musical works was common. Publishers had few qualms about attaching Haydn's name to popular works by lesser composers, an arrangement that effectively robbed the lesser musician of livelihood. Webster notes that Haydn's ruthlessness in business might be viewed more sympathetically in light of his struggles with poverty during his years as a freelancer\u2014and that outside of the world of business, in his dealings, for example, with relatives, musicians and servants, and in volunteering his services for charitable concerts, Haydn was a generous man \u2013 offering to teach the two infant sons of Mozart for free after their father's death.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> When Haydn died he was certainly comfortably off, but by middle class rather than aristocratic standards.\n\nHaydn was short in stature, perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth. He was not handsome, and like many in his day he was a survivor of [[smallpox]]; his face was pitted with the scars of this disease.{{efn|The date of Haydn's bout with smallpox is not preserved. It was prior to the time he was hired by Countess Thun (i.e. as a young adult; see above), since it is recorded that when she first encountered Haydn she observed his scars as part of the generally poor impression his appearance made on her. See Geiringer (1983:34).}} His biographer [[Albert Christoph Dies|Dies]] wrote: \"he couldn't understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman. 'They couldn't have been led to it by my beauty.{{'\"}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Dies|1810}}, (in the English translation from Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, p. 157).</ref>\n\nHis nose, large and aquiline, was disfigured by the [[Nasal polyp|polyps]] he suffered during much of his adult life,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hadden|1902|p=158}}</ref> an agonizing and debilitating disease that at times prevented him from writing music.<ref>Cohen, Jack (1998), \"The agony of nasal polyps and the terror of their removal 200 years ago\", ''The Laryngoscope'' 108(9): 1311\u201313 (September 1998).</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{main article|List of compositions by Joseph Haydn}}\nJames Webster summarizes Haydn's role in the history of classical music as follows: \"He excelled in every musical genre.&nbsp;... He is familiarly known as the 'father of the symphony' and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet; no other composer approaches his combination of productivity, quality and historical importance in these genres.\"<ref>''New Grove'', online edition, article \"Joseph Haydn\"; accessed 3 February 2007</ref>\n\n=== Structure and character of his music ===\nA central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical [[Motif (music)|motifs]], often derived from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Sutcliffe|1989|p=343}} mentions this in a criticism of contemporary Haydn performance practice: \"[Haydn's] music sometime seems to 'live on its nerves'&nbsp;... It is above all in this respect that Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing 'physiognomy' of Haydn's music, subsiding instead into an ease of manner and a concern for broader effects that they have acquired in their playing of Mozart.\"}}\n\n[[File:Haydn Kaiserlied Reinschrift.jpg|thumb|250px|Original copy of \"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]\" in Haydn's hand|left]]\nHaydn's work was central to the development of what came to be called [[sonata form]]. His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition. Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called [[Sonata form#Monothematic expositions|monothematic exposition]], in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme. Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive [[thematic development]].{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|p=112}} writes: \"Having begun to 'develop', he could not stop; his recapitulations begin to take on irregular contours, sometimes sharply condensed, sometimes surprisingly expanded, losing their first tame symmetry to regain a balance of a far higher and more satisfying order.\"}}\n\nHaydn's formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the [[fugue]] into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic (see [[sonata rondo form]]). Haydn was also the principal exponent of the [[double variation]] form\u2014variations on two alternating themes, which are often major- and minor-mode versions of each other.\n\nPerhaps more than any other composer's, Haydn's music is known for its humor.{{efn|[[Steven Isserlis]] calls him \"the funniest of the great composers\" (preface to Richard Wigmore, ''The Faber Pocket Guide to Haydn'' (Faber, 2011)). {{Harvtxt|Brendel|2001}} focuses on the humor of both Haydn and Beethoven. {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997|p=111}} attributes to Haydn \"an aptitude for the facetious that no other composer enjoyed\".}} The most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his [[Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)|\"Surprise\" symphony]]; Haydn's many other musical jokes include numerous [[False ending#Music|false endings]] (e.g., in the quartets [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Op. 33 No. 2]] and [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)|Op. 50 No. 3]]), and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)#Opus 50, No. 1|Op. 50 No. 1]].<ref>The means by which Haydn fools the listener as to the location of the downbeat are discussed by\nDanuta Mirka (2009) ''Metric Manipulations in Haydn and Mozart: Chamber Music for Strings, 1787\u20131791'', Oxford University Press, pp. 197\u2013198.</ref>\n\nMuch of the music was written to please and delight a prince, and its emotional tone is correspondingly upbeat.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} This tone also reflects, perhaps, Haydn's fundamentally healthy and well-balanced personality. Occasional minor-key works, often deadly serious in character, form striking exceptions to the general rule. Haydn's fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy, especially in the finales. Some characteristic examples of Haydn's \"rollicking\" finale type are found in the [[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|\"London\" Symphony No. 104]], the String Quartet Op. 50 No. 1, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 27. Haydn's early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective. Later on, the emotional range of the slow movements increases, notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)|Op. 76 Nos. 3 and 5]], the [[Symphony No. 98 (Haydn)|Symphonies No. 98]] and [[Symphony No. 102 (Haydn)|102]], and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 23. The [[minuets]] tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character. Over time, Haydn turned some of his minuets into \"[[Scherzo|scherzi]]\" which are much faster, at one beat to the bar.\n\n===Evolution of Haydn's style===\nHaydn's early work dates from a period in which the compositional style of the High [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (seen in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]) had gone out of fashion. This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn, born 18 years before the death of Bach, was himself one of the musical explorers of this time.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Rosen|1997|p=57}}. \"[T]he period from 1750 to 1775 was penetrated by eccentricity, hit-or-miss experimentation, resulting in works which are still difficult to accept today because of their oddities\". Similar remarks are made by {{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|pp=111\u201312}}.</ref> An older contemporary whose work Haydn acknowledged as an important influence was [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]].<ref name=\"Geiringer30\" />\n\nTracing Haydn's work over the six decades in which it was produced (roughly from 1749 to 1802), one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication, which developed as Haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues. Several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of Haydn's musical style.\n\nIn the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as \"[[Sturm und Drang]]\" (\"storm and stress\"). This term is taken from [[Sturm und Drang|a literary movement]] of about the same time, though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years.{{efn|See {{Harvtxt|Webster|2002|p=18}}: \"the term has been criticized: taken from the title of a play of 1776 by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|Maximilian Klinger]], it properly pertains to a literary movement of the middle and late 1770s rather than a musical one of about 1768\u20131772\".}} The musical language of this period is similar to what went before, but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive, especially in the works in minor keys. James Webster describes the works of this period as \"longer, more passionate, and more daring\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=18}}</ref> Some of the most famous compositions of this time are the [[Symphony No. 44 (Haydn)|\"Trauer\" (Mourning) Symphony No. 44]], [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|\"Farewell\" Symphony No. 45]], the Piano Sonata in C minor (Hob. XVI/20, L. 33), and the [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|six \"Sun\" Quartets Op. 20]], all from c. 1771\u201372. It was also around this time that Haydn became interested in writing [[fugue]]s in the Baroque style, and three of the Op. 20 quartets end with a fugue.\n\nFollowing the climax of the \"Sturm und Drang\", Haydn returned to a lighter, more overtly entertaining style. There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes [[trumpet]]s and [[timpani]]. These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn's professional duties, which moved him away from \"pure\" music and toward the production of [[Opera buffa|comic operas]]. Several of the operas were Haydn's own work (see [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn]]); these are seldom performed today. Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works,{{sfn|Webster|Feder|2001|loc=section 3.iii}} which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade.\n[[File:HaydnPlaying.jpg|thumb|350x350px|''Joseph Haydn Playing Quartets'']]\nIn 1779, an important change in Haydn's contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer. This may have encouraged Haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of \"pure\" music. The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|six Op. 33 String Quartets]], announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in \"a new and completely special way\".{{efn|Original German \"Neu, gantz besonderer Art\"; Sisman (1993, 219)}} [[Charles Rosen]] has argued that this assertion on Haydn's part was not just sales talk but meant quite seriously, and he points out a number of important advances in Haydn's compositional technique that appear in these quartets, advances that mark the advent of the [[Classical music era|Classical]] style in full flower. These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of \"Classical [[counterpoint]]\" in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity. These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Op. 33.{{efn|Rosen's case that Opus 33 represents a \"revolution in style\" (1971 and 1997, 116) can be found in chapter III.1 of {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}}. For dissenting views, see {{Harvtxt|Larsen|1980|p=102}} and {{Harvtxt|Webster|1991}}. For discussion of the development of the same trend in Haydn's style in the symphonies that preceded the Opus 33 quartets see {{harvtxt|Rosen|1988|pp=181\u2013186}}.}}\n\nIn the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his \"popular style\", a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure.{{efn|Rosen discusses the popular style in ch. VI.1 of {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}}.}} An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of [[folk music|folk]] or folk-like material (see [[Haydn and folk music]]). Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales. In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure.{{sfn|Rosen|1997|pp=333\u2013337}} Haydn's popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work, including the twelve [[London symphonies|\"London\" symphonies]], the late quartets and piano trios, and the two late [[oratorio]]s.\n\nThe return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn's career. Although his musical style evolved little, his intentions as a composer changed. While he had been a servant, and later a busy entrepreneur, Haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion, with frequent deadlines. As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity. This is reflected in the subject matter of ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music. Haydn's new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work: both oratorios took him over a year to complete. Haydn once remarked that he had worked on ''The Creation'' so long because he wanted it to last.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=158}}</ref>\n\nThe change in Haydn's approach was important in the [[history of classical music traditions|history of classical music]], as other composers were soon following his lead. Notably, Beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high.{{efn|For discussion, see [[Antony Hopkins]] (1981) ''The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven'', Heinemann, London, pp. 7\u20138.}}\n\n===Identifying Haydn's works===\n\n[[Anthony van Hoboken]] prepared a comprehensive catalogue of Haydn's works. The [[Hoboken catalogue]] assigns a catalog number to each work, called its Hoboken number (abbreviated H. or Hob.). These Hoboken numbers are often used in identifying Haydn's compositions.\n\nHaydn's string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but they are usually identified instead by their [[opus number]]s, which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together. For example, the string quartet [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 3 (\"Emperor\")|Opus 76, No. 3]] is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as Opus 76.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Classical music|Opera}}\n\n===Works===\n* [[List of compositions by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of concertos by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of piano trios by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of solo piano compositions by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of symphonies by Joseph Haydn]]\n\n===Contemporaries===\n* [[Marianna Martines|Marianne von Martines]]{{spaced ndash}}as a child, one of Haydn's first students; as an adult, a friend and eminent musician.\n* [[List of Austrians in music]]\n\n===Other topics===\n* [[Joseph Haydn's ethnicity]]{{Spaced ndash}}was Haydn [[Croats|Croatian]]?\n* [[Haydn's birthplace]]\n* [[List of residences of Joseph Haydn|List of Haydn's residences]]\n* [[Mannersdorf am Leithagebirge]], visited by Haydn during the summer of 1753.\n* [[Evolution of timpani in the 18th and 19th centuries#Haydn's timpani writing|Haydn's writing for timpani]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Biographical sources===\n* {{cite book |last=Dies |first=Albert Christoph |authorlink=Albert Christoph Dies |year=1810 |title=Biographische Nachrichten von Joseph Haydn nach m\u00fcndlichen Erz\u00e4hlungen desselben entworfen und herausgegeben |trans-title=Biographical Accounts of Joseph Haydn, written and edited from his own spoken narratives |location=Vienna |publisher=Camesinaische Buchhandlung |ref=harv }} English translation in: {{cite book |last=Dies |first=Albert Christoph |chapter=Biographical Accounts of Joseph Haydn |year=1963 |editor-last=Gotwals |editor-first=Vernon |title=Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits |others=(translation by Vernon Gotwals) |location=Milwaukee |publisher=Univ. of Wisconsin Press |isbn=0-299-02791-0 |ref=CITEREFGotwals1963 }} One of the first biographies of Haydn, written on the basis of 30 interviews carried out during the composer's old age.\n* {{cite book |last=[[Ludwig Finscher|Finscher]] | first= Ludwig | year=2000|title=Joseph Haydn und seine Zeit|publisher=Laaber-Verlag |place=Laaber|isbn=3-921518-94-6 |ref=harv }} Highly detailed discussion of life and work; in German.\n* {{cite book|last=Geiringer|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Geiringer|last2=Geiringer|first2=Irene|title=Haydn: A Creative Life in Music|publisher=University of California|edition=3rd|year=1982|isbn=0-520-04316-2|ref={{harvid|Geiringer|1982}}|url=https://archive.org/details/haydncreativelif00geir_0}} The first edition was published in 1946 with Karl Geiringer as the sole author.\n* {{cite book|title=Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits|translator=Vernon Gotwals |editor=Vernon Gotwals | place=Milwaukee | year= 1963 | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-02791-0 | last=Griesinger| first=Georg August| authorlink=Georg August Griesinger| chapter=Biographical Notes Concerning Joseph Haydn |ref=harv}} A translation from the original German: {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Griesinger|1810}}|reference=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sGhDAAAAcAAJ ''Biographische Notizen \u00fcber Joseph Haydn''] (1810).

His father was [[Mathias Haydn]], a [[wheelwright]] who also served as \"Marktrichter\", an office akin to village mayor. Haydn's mother Maria, {{n\u00e9e}} Koller, had previously worked as a cook in the palace of [[Aloys Thomas Raimund, Count Harrach|Count Harrach]], the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Neither parent could read music;{{efn|Haydn reported this in his 1776 [[Autobiographical sketch (Haydn)|Autobiographical sketch]].}} however, Mathias was an enthusiastic [[folk music]]ian, who during the [[journeyman]] period of his career had taught himself to play the [[harp]]. According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his childhood family was extremely musical, and frequently sang together and with their neighbours.<ref>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|pp=80\u201381}}).}}</ref>\n\nHaydn's parents had noticed that their son was musically gifted and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain serious musical training. It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in [[Hainburg an der Donau|Hainburg]], that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician. Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg and he never again lived with his parents.\n\nLife in the Frankh household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry<ref>{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=9}}</ref> and humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing.<ref>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=82}}).}}</ref> He began his musical training there, and could soon play both [[harpsichord]] and [[violin]]. The people of Hainburg heard him sing [[Boy soprano|treble]] parts in the church [[choir]].\n\nThere is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739{{efn|{{Harvnb|Finscher|2000|p=12}}.

Haydn passed his audition with Reutter, and after several months of further training moved to Vienna (1740), where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister.\n\nHaydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter's family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother [[Michael Haydn|Michael]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones2009a|pp=12\u201313}}.

He led the count's small orchestra in [[Doln\u00ed Lukavice|Unterlukawitz]] and wrote his first symphonies for this ensemble. In 1760, with the security of a Kapellmeister position, Haydn married. His wife was the former Maria Anna Theresia Keller (1729\u20131800),<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]], [http://michaelorenz.blogspot.co.at/2014/09/joseph-haydns-real-wife_11.html \"Joseph Haydn's Real Wife\"] (Vienna 2014).

They produced no children, and both took lovers.{{efn|Mrs. Haydn's paramour (1770) was [[Ludwig Guttenbrunn]], an artist who produced the portrait of Haydn [[#Guttenbrunn|seen above]] {{Harv|Landon|Jones| 1988|p=109}}. Joseph Haydn had a long relationship, starting in 1779, with the singer [[Luigia Polzelli]], and was probably the father of her son Antonio {{Harv|Landon|Jones|1988|p=116}}.}}\n\nCount Morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment, but Haydn was quickly offered a similar job (1761) by Prince [[Paul II Anton Esterh\u00e1zy|Paul Anton]], head of the immensely wealthy [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zy family]]. Haydn's job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterh\u00e1zy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister [[Gregor Werner]] retaining authority only for church music. When Werner died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister.{{anchor|Guttenbrunn}}\n\nAs a \"house officer\" in the Esterh\u00e1zy establishment, Haydn wore [[livery]] and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the family's ancestral seat [[Schloss Esterh\u00e1zy]] in [[Eisenstadt|Kismarton]] ''(today Eisenstadt, Austria)'' and later on [[Esterh\u00e1za]], a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s. Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing [[chamber music]] for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions. Despite this backbreaking workload,{{efn|{{harv|Landon|Jones|1988|p=100}} write: \"Haydn's duties were crushing. We can notice the effect in his handwriting, which becomes hastier as the 1770s turn to the 1780s: the notation starts to become ever more careless in the scores and the abbreviations multiply.\"}} the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn.{{sfn|Webster|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|Landon|Jones|1988|p=37}} The Esterh\u00e1zy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762\u20131790 [[Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy|Nikolaus I]]) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra. During the nearly thirty years that Haydn worked at the Esterh\u00e1zy court, he produced a flood of compositions, and his musical style continued to develop.\n[[File:Nikolaus Esterhazy.jpg|thumb|left|Prince [[Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy]], Haydn's most important patron]]\n\nMuch of Haydn's activity at the time followed the musical taste of his patron Prince Nikolaus. In about 1765, the prince obtained and began to learn to play the [[baryton]], an uncommon musical instrument similar to the bass [[viol]], but with a set of plucked sympathetic strings. Haydn was commanded to provide music for the prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, the most notable of which are the 126 [[Baryton trios (Haydn)|baryton trios]]. Around 1775, the prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theater the prince had built at Esterh\u00e1za came to host a major season, with multiple productions each year. Haydn served as company director, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances. He wrote [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn#Composed during Haydn's service for the Eszterh\u00e1zy family|several of the operas performed]] and wrote substitution [[aria]]s to insert into the operas of other composers.\n\n1779 was a watershed year for Haydn, as his contract was renegotiated: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterh\u00e1zy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers. Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign. His new employment contract \"acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn's career, the achievement of international popularity. By 1790 Haydn was in the paradoxical position ... of being Europe's leading composer, but someone who spent his time as a duty-bound Kapellmeister in a remote palace in the Hungarian countryside.\"{{sfn|Jones|2009b|p=136}} The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op. [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|33]], [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)|50]], 54/55, and [[String Quartets, Op. 64 (Haydn)|64]]). Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the [[Paris symphonies]] (1785\u20131786) and the original orchestral version of ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ (Haydn)|The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'' (1786), a commission from [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain.\n[[File:Fert\u0151d - The Eszterh\u00e1zy Castle or Palace.jpg|thumb|250px|View of [[Eszterh\u00e1za]]]]\n\nThe remoteness of Esterh\u00e1za, which was farther from Vienna than Kismarton, led Haydn gradually to feel more isolated and lonely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=60}}</ref> He longed to visit Vienna because of his friendships there.<ref>For details see {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|loc=Chapter 6}}</ref> Of these, a particularly important one was with [[Maria Anna von Genzinger]] (1754\u20131793), the wife of Prince Nikolaus's personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic relationship with the composer in 1789. Haydn wrote to Mrs. Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterh\u00e1za and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in Vienna. Later on, Haydn wrote to her frequently from London. Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his [[Variations in F minor|F minor variations]] for piano, Hob. XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=316}}, citing Robbins Landon.</ref>\n\nAnother friend in Vienna was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whom [[Haydn and Mozart|Haydn had met]] sometime around 1784.

Mozart evidently returned the esteem, as seen in his dedication of a set of six quartets, now called the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|\"Haydn\" quartets]], to his friend.

Following a trend of the time,{{sfn|Jones|2009a}} Anton sought to economize by dismissing most of the court musicians. Haydn retained a nominal appointment with Anton, at a reduced salary of 400 florins, as well as a 1000-florin pension from Nikolaus.<ref>Geiringer (1982, 96)</ref> Since Anton had little need of Haydn's services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from [[Johann Peter Salomon]], a German violinist and  [[impresario]], to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra.\n\nThe choice was a sensible one because Haydn was already a very popular composer there. Since the death of [[Johann Christian Bach]] in 1782, Haydn's music had dominated the concert scene in London; \"hardly a concert did not feature a work by him\".<ref name=\"Jones2009b_325\">{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=325}}.</ref> Haydn's work was widely distributed by publishers in London, including Forster (who had their own contract with Haydn) and Longman & [[Robert Broderip|Broderip]] (who served as agent in England for Haydn's Vienna publisher [[Artaria]]).{{r|Jones2009b_325}} Efforts to bring Haydn to London had been undertaken since 1782, though Haydn's loyalty to Prince Nikolaus had prevented him from accepting.{{r|Jones2009b_325}}\n\nAfter fond farewells from Mozart and other friends,<ref>For narratives of Haydn's last days in Mozart's company, see [[Haydn and Mozart]]</ref> Haydn departed Vienna with Salomon on 15 December 1790, arriving in [[Calais]] in time to cross the English Channel on New Year's Day of 1791.

Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in Great Pulteney Street (London, near [[Piccadilly Circus]])<ref name=\"Jones2009b_137\">{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=137}}</ref> working in a borrowed studio at the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]] piano firm nearby.{{r|Jones2009b_137}}\n\nIt was the start of a very auspicious period for Haydn; both the 1791\u20131792 journey, along with a repeat visit in 1794\u20131795, were greatly successful. Audiences flocked to Haydn's concerts; he augmented his fame and made large profits, thus becoming financially secure.{{efn|According to [[David Wyn Jones|Jones]], the London visits yielded a net profit of 15,000 florins. Haydn continued to prosper after the visits and at his death left an estate valued at 55,713 florins. These were substantial sums; for comparison, the house he bought in Gumpendorf in 1793 (and then remodeled) cost only 1370 florins (all figures from Jones 2009:144\u2013146).}} [[Charles Burney]] reviewed the first concert thus: \"Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England.\"{{efn|From Burney's memoirs; quoted from {{Harvtxt|Landon|Jones|1988|p=234}}}} Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with [[Rebecca Schroeter]].\n[[File:Hanover-Square-Rooms.png|thumb|The [[Hanover Square Rooms]], principal venue of Haydn's performances in London|left|240x240px]]\n\nMusically, Haydn's visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the ''[[Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)|Surprise]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 100 (Haydn)|Military]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 103 (Haydn)|Drumroll]]'' and ''[[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|London]]'' symphonies; the ''Rider'' quartet; and the [[Piano Trio No. 39 (Haydn)|\"Gypsy Rondo\"]] piano trio. The great success of the overall enterprise does not mean that the journeys were free of trouble. Notably, his very first project, the commissioned opera ''[[L'anima del filosofo]]'' was duly written during the early stages of the trip, but the opera's impresario [[John Gallini]] was unable to obtain a license to permit opera performances in the theater he directed, the [[Her Majesty's Theatre|King's Theatre]]. Haydn was well paid for the opera (\u00a3300) but much time was wasted.{{efn|The premier performance did not take place until 1951, during the [[Florence May Festival]]. [[Maria Callas]] sang the role of Euridice. The opera and its history are discussed in {{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}.}} Thus only two new symphonies, [[Symphony No. 95 (Haydn)|no. 95]] and [[Symphony No. 96 (Haydn)|no. 96 ''Miracle'']], could be premiered in the 12 concerts of Salomon's spring concert series. Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the [[Professional Concerts]], who recruited Haydn's old pupil [[Ignaz Pleyel]] as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other's symphonies on their concert programs.\n\nThe end of Salomon's series in June gave Haydn a rare period of relative leisure. He spent some of the time in the country ([[Hertingfordbury]]), but also had time to travel, notably to Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University. The symphony performed for the occasion, [[Symphony No. 92 (Haydn)|no. 92]] has since come to be known as the ''Oxford Symphony'', although it had been written in 1789.<ref>\"Oxford Symphony'', article by Jane Holland in Jones (2009b:266)</ref>\n\n[[File:Franz Joseph Haydn 1732-1809 by John Hoppner 1791.jpg|thumb|195px|Haydn as portrayed by [[John Hoppner]] in England in 1791]]\nWhile traveling to London in 1790, Haydn had met the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in his native city of [[Bonn]]. On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and [[Beethoven and his contemporaries#Joseph Haydn|was Haydn's pupil]] up until the second London journey. Haydn took Beethoven with him to [[Eisenstadt]] for the summer, where Haydn had little to do, and taught Beethoven some [[counterpoint]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Geiringer|1982|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref> While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodeling it. He also arranged for the performance of some of his London symphonies in local concerts.\n\nBy the time he arrived on his second journey to England, (1794\u20131795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene. The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon's ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts. The concerts included the premieres of the 99th, 100th, and 101st symphonies. For 1795, Salomon had abandoned his own series, citing difficulty in obtaining \"vocal performers of the first rank from abroad\", and Haydn joined forces with the Opera Concerts, headed by the violinist [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]]. These were the venue of the last three symphonies, 102, 103, and 104. The final benefit concert for Haydn (\"Dr. Haydn's night\") at the end of the 1795 season was a great success and was perhaps the peak of his English career. Haydn's biographer [[Georg August Griesinger|Griesinger]] wrote that Haydn \"considered the days spent in England the happiest of his life. He was everywhere appreciated there; it opened a new world to him\".{{sfn|Webster|2002|p=37}}\n\n=== Years of celebrity in Vienna ===\nHaydn returned to Vienna in 1795. Prince Anton had died, and his successor [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Nikolaus II]] proposed that the Esterh\u00e1zy musical establishment be revived with Haydn serving again as Kapellmeister. Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis. He spent his summers with the Esterh\u00e1zys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn|masses]] for them.\n\n[[File:Haydn by Thaler Wien SAM 350 2.jpg|thumb|210px|Wax sculpture of Haydn by Franz Thaler, c. 1800|right]]\nBy this time Haydn had become a public figure in Vienna. He spent most of his time in his home, a large house in the suburb of Windm\u00fchle,{{efn|The house, at Haydngasse 19, has since 1899 been a Haydn museum ([http://www.planetware.com/vienna/haydn-museum-a-w-hayd.htm 16 Top-Rated Museums and Art Galleries in Vienna \u2013 16. Haydn House] by Bryan Dearsley; [http://www.wienmuseum.at/de/standorte/haydnhaus.html Haydnhaus], [[Vienna Museum]]).}} and wrote works for public performance. In collaboration with his librettist and mentor [[Gottfried van Swieten]], and with funding from van Swieten's [[Gesellschaft der Associierten]], he composed his two great oratorios, ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801). Both were enthusiastically received. Haydn frequently appeared before the public, often leading performances of ''The Creation'' and ''The Seasons'' for charity benefits, including [[Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t]] programs with massed musical forces. He also composed instrumental music: the popular ''[[Trumpet Concerto (Haydn)|Trumpet Concerto]]'', and the last nine in his long series of string quartets, including the ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 2 (\"Fifths\")|Fifths]]'', ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 3 (\"Emperor\")|Emperor]]'', and ''[[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 4 (\"Sunrise\")|Sunrise]]''. Directly inspired by hearing audiences sing [[God Save the King]] in London, in 1797 Haydn wrote a patriotic \"Emperor's Hymn\" [[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]], (\"God Save Emperor Francis\"). This achieved great success and became \"the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War\" (Jones){{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}. The melody was used for von Fallersleben's ''[[Deutschlandlied]]'' (1841), which was written as part of the German unification movement and whose third stanza is today the [[national anthem]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. (Modern Austria uses an anthem with music by Mozart.)\n\nDuring the later years of this successful period, Haydn faced incipient old age and fluctuating health, and he had to struggle to complete his final works. His last major work, from 1802, was the sixth mass for the Esterh\u00e1zys, the ''[[Harmoniemesse]]''.\n\n===Retirement, illness, and death===\nBy the end of 1803, Haydn's condition had declined to the point that he became physically unable to compose. He suffered from weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate and painfully swollen legs. Since diagnosis was uncertain in Haydn's time, it is unlikely that the precise illness can ever be identified, though [[David Wyn Jones|Jones]] suggests [[arteriosclerosis]].<ref>For symptoms see {{harvnb|Jones|2009a|p=146}}; for the arteriosclerosis hypothesis see {{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=216}}.</ref> The illness was especially hard for Haydn because the flow of fresh musical ideas continued unabated, although he could no longer work them out as compositions.{{efn|Of Haydn's plight, {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}} wrote, \"The last years of Haydn's life, with all his success, comfort, and celebrity, are among the saddest in music. More moving than the false pathos of a [[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart#Funeral|pauper's grave for Mozart]] ... is the figure of Haydn filled with musical ideas which were struggling to escape, as he himself said; he was too old and weak to go to the piano and submit to the discipline of working them out.\"}} His biographer Dies reported Haydn saying in 1806:\n\n<blockquote>\"I must have something to do\u2014usually musical ideas are pursuing me, to the point of torture, I cannot escape them, they stand like walls before me. If it's an [[allegro (music)|allegro]] that pursues me, my pulse keeps beating faster, I can get no sleep. If it's an [[Adagio (music)|adagio]], then I notice my pulse beating slowly. My imagination plays on me as if I were a clavier.\"{{efn|\"Clavier\" in the original German is ambiguous; literally \"keyboard\", it is used by extension to denote a keyboard instrument such as the piano or harpsichord. {{harvnb|Dies|1810|p=141}}.}} Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said \"I am really just a living clavier.\"</blockquote>\n\n[[File:HaydnsHouseInVienna.PNG|thumb|left|200px|The house in Vienna (now [[Vienna Museum#Haydn House|a museum]]) where Haydn spent the last years of his life]]\nThe winding down of Haydn's career was gradual. The Esterh\u00e1zy family kept him on as Kapellmeister to the very end (much as they had with his predecessor Werner long before), but they  appointed new staff to lead their musical establishment: Johann Michael Fuchs in 1802 as Vice-Kapellmeister<ref name=Jones2009a_209>{{harvnb|Jones|2009a|p=209}}.</ref> and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] as Konzertmeister in 1804.{{sfn|Jones|2009a|pp=214\u2013215}} Haydn's last summer in Eisenstadt was in 1803,{{r|Jones2009a_209}} and his last appearance before the public as a conductor was a charity performance of ''[[The Seven Last Words]]'' on 26 December 1803. As debility set in, he made largely futile efforts at composition, attempting to revise a rediscovered ''[[Missa brevis (Haydn)|Missa brevis]]'' from his teenage years and complete his [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn#Opus 103|final string quartet]]. The latter project was abandoned for good in 1805, and the quartet was published with just two movements.{{sfn|Jones|2009a|p=213}}\n\nHaydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honors during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him.<ref>{{harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=198}} gives the testimony of Haydn's early biographer [[Giuseppe Carpani]].</ref> During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his \"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser|Emperor's Hymn]]\". A final triumph occurred on 27 March 1808 when a performance of ''The Creation'' was organized in his honour. The very frail composer was brought into the hall on an armchair to the sound of trumpets and drums and was greeted by Beethoven, [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]] (who led the performance) and by other musicians and members of the aristocracy<!--Speculation?: , many of whom probably sensed that they were saying goodbye to the elderly composer-->. Haydn was both moved and exhausted by the experience and had to depart at intermission.<ref>{{harvnb|Geiringer|1982|pp=186\u2013187}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bergkirchemitkalvarienberg.jpg|thumb|[[Bergkirche (Eisenstadt)|Bergkirche]] in Eisenstadt, site of Haydn's tomb]]\nHaydn lived on for 14 more months. His final days were hardly serene, as in May 1809 the French army under [[Napoleon]] launched an attack on Vienna and on 10 May bombarded his neighborhood. According to Griesinger, \"Four [[case shot]]s fell, rattling the windows and doors of his house. He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, 'Don't be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!'. But the spirit was stronger than the flesh, for he had hardly uttered the brave words when his whole body began to tremble.\"<ref name=Griesinger1810_50>{{harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=50}}.</ref> More bombardments followed until the city fell to the French on 13 May.<ref name=Jones2009b_142>{{harvnb|Jones|2009b|p=142}}</ref> Haydn, was, however, deeply moved and appreciative when on 17 May a French cavalry officer named Sul\u00e9my came to pay his respects and sang, skillfully, an aria from ''The Creation''.<ref>\"Mit W\u00fcrd' und Hoheit angetan\", the aria narrating the creation of humankind; {{harvtxt|Griesinger|1810|p=51}}. According to the less-reliable Dies, the date was 25 May, the officer's name was Sulimi, and he sang an aria from ''The Seasons'' ({{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=193}}}}).</ref>\n\nOn 26 May Haydn played his \"Emperor's Hymn\" with unusual gusto three times; the same evening he collapsed and was taken to what proved to be to his deathbed.{{r|Griesinger1810_50}} He died peacefully at 12:40&nbsp;a.m. on 31 May 1809, aged 77.{{r|Jones2009b_142}} On 15 June, a memorial service was held in the [[Schottenkirche, Vienna|Schottenkirche]] at which Mozart's [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] was performed. Haydn's remains were interred in the local Hundsturm cemetery until 1820, when they were moved to Eisenstadt by Prince Nikolaus. His head took a different journey; [[Haydn's head|it was stolen]] by [[phrenology|phrenologists]] shortly after burial, and the skull was reunited with the other remains only in 1954.\n\n==Character and appearance==\n[[File:Joseph Haydn Signature.svg|thumb|300px|Haydn's signature on a work of music: ''di me giuseppe Haydn'' (\"by me Joseph Haydn\").

His modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged. These traits were not only prerequisites to his success as [[Kapellmeister]], entrepreneur and public figure, but also aided the favorable reception of his music.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=44}}. These same traits, and his connection to the aristocracy contributed to the decline in his reputation in the nineteenth century: {{Harvnb|Proksch|2015}}</ref> Haydn was especially respected by the Esterh\u00e1zy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer; see [[Papa Haydn]] and the tale of the [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|\"Farewell\" Symphony]]. Haydn had a robust sense of humor, evident in his love of practical jokes<ref>{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|pp=92\u201393}}).}}</ref> and often apparent in his music, and he had many friends. For much of his life he benefited from a \"happy and naturally cheerful temperament\",<ref>{{harvnb|Dies|1810|loc=(in the English translation from {{harvnb|Gotwals|1963|p=91}}).}}</ref> but in his later life, there is evidence for periods of depression, notably in the correspondence with [[Maria Anna von Genzinger|Mrs. Genzinger]] and in Dies's biography, based on visits made in Haydn's old age.\n\nHaydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his [[rosary]] when he had trouble composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griesinger|1963|p=54}}</ref> He normally began the manuscript of each composition with \"in nomine Domini\" (\"in the name of the Lord\") and ended with \"Laus Deo\" (\"praise be to God\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Larsen|1980|p=81}}</ref>\n\nHaydn's early years of poverty and awareness of the financial precariousness of musical life made him astute and even sharp in his business dealings. Some contemporaries (usually, it has to be said, wealthy ones) were surprised and even shocked at this. Webster writes: \"As regards money, Haydn\u2026always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterh\u00e1zy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over [to publishers in different countries]; he regularly engaged in 'sharp practice'\u201d which nowadays might be regarded as plain fraud.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[New Grove]]'', online edition, \"Haydn, Joseph\", section 6</ref> But those were days when copyright was in its infancy, and the pirating of musical works was common. Publishers had few qualms about attaching Haydn's name to popular works by lesser composers, an arrangement that effectively robbed the lesser musician of livelihood. Webster notes that Haydn's ruthlessness in business might be viewed more sympathetically in light of his struggles with poverty during his years as a freelancer\u2014and that outside of the world of business, in his dealings, for example, with relatives, musicians and servants, and in volunteering his services for charitable concerts, Haydn was a generous man \u2013 offering to teach the two infant sons of Mozart for free after their father's death.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> When Haydn died he was certainly comfortably off, but by middle class rather than aristocratic standards.\n\nHaydn was short in stature, perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth. He was not handsome, and like many in his day he was a survivor of [[smallpox]]; his face was pitted with the scars of this disease.{{efn|The date of Haydn's bout with smallpox is not preserved. It was prior to the time he was hired by Countess Thun (i.e. as a young adult; see above), since it is recorded that when she first encountered Haydn she observed his scars as part of the generally poor impression his appearance made on her. See Geiringer (1983:34).}} His biographer [[Albert Christoph Dies|Dies]] wrote: \"he couldn't understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman. 'They couldn't have been led to it by my beauty.{{'\"}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Dies|1810}}, (in the English translation from {{harvnb|Landon|Jones|1988|p=157}})</ref>\n\nHis nose, large and aquiline, was disfigured by the [[Nasal polyp|polyps]] he suffered during much of his adult life,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hadden|1902|p=158}}</ref> an agonizing and debilitating disease that at times prevented him from writing music.<ref>Cohen, Jack (1998), \"The agony of nasal polyps and the terror of their removal 200 years ago\", ''The Laryngoscope'' 108(9): 1311\u201313 (September 1998).</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{main article|List of compositions by Joseph Haydn}}\nJames Webster summarizes Haydn's role in the history of classical music as follows: \"He excelled in every musical genre.&nbsp;... He is familiarly known as the 'father of the symphony' and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet; no other composer approaches his combination of productivity, quality and historical importance in these genres.\"<ref>''New Grove'', online edition, article \"Joseph Haydn\"; accessed 3 February 2007</ref>\n\n=== Structure and character of his music ===\nA central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical [[Motif (music)|motifs]], often derived from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Sutcliffe|1989|p=343}} mentions this in a criticism of contemporary Haydn performance practice: \"[Haydn's] music sometime seems to 'live on its nerves'&nbsp;... It is above all in this respect that Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing 'physiognomy' of Haydn's music, subsiding instead into an ease of manner and a concern for broader effects that they have acquired in their playing of Mozart.\"}}\n\n[[File:Haydn Kaiserlied Reinschrift.jpg|thumb|250px|Original copy of \"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]\" in Haydn's hand|left]]\nHaydn's work was central to the development of what came to be called [[sonata form]]. His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition. Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called [[Sonata form#Monothematic expositions|monothematic exposition]], in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme. Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive [[thematic development]].{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|p=112}} writes: \"Having begun to 'develop', he could not stop; his recapitulations begin to take on irregular contours, sometimes sharply condensed, sometimes surprisingly expanded, losing their first tame symmetry to regain a balance of a far higher and more satisfying order.\"}}\n\nHaydn's formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the [[fugue]] into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic (see [[sonata rondo form]]). Haydn was also the principal exponent of the [[double variation]] form\u2014variations on two alternating themes, which are often major- and minor-mode versions of each other.\n\nPerhaps more than any other composer's, Haydn's music is known for its humor.{{efn|[[Steven Isserlis]] calls him \"the funniest of the great composers\" (preface to Richard Wigmore, ''The Faber Pocket Guide to Haydn'' (Faber, 2011)). {{Harvtxt|Brendel|2001}} focuses on the humor of both Haydn and Beethoven. {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997|p=111}} attributes to Haydn \"an aptitude for the facetious that no other composer enjoyed\".}} The most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his [[Symphony No. 94 (Haydn)|\"Surprise\" symphony]]; Haydn's many other musical jokes include numerous [[False ending#Music|false endings]] (e.g., in the quartets [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Op. 33 No. 2]] and [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)|Op. 50 No. 3]]), and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)#Opus 50, No. 1|Op. 50 No. 1]].<ref>The means by which Haydn fools the listener as to the location of the downbeat are discussed by\nDanuta Mirka (2009) ''Metric Manipulations in Haydn and Mozart: Chamber Music for Strings, 1787\u20131791'', Oxford University Press, pp. 197\u2013198.</ref>\n\nMuch of the music was written to please and delight a prince, and its emotional tone is correspondingly upbeat.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} This tone also reflects, perhaps, Haydn's fundamentally healthy and well-balanced personality. Occasional minor-key works, often deadly serious in character, form striking exceptions to the general rule. Haydn's fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy, especially in the finales. Some characteristic examples of Haydn's \"rollicking\" finale type are found in the [[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|\"London\" Symphony No. 104]], the String Quartet Op. 50 No. 1, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 27. Haydn's early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective. Later on, the emotional range of the slow movements increases, notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)|Op. 76 Nos. 3 and 5]], the [[Symphony No. 98 (Haydn)|Symphonies No. 98]] and [[Symphony No. 102 (Haydn)|102]], and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 23. The [[minuets]] tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character. Over time, Haydn turned some of his minuets into \"[[Scherzo|scherzi]]\" which are much faster, at one beat to the bar.\n\n===Evolution of Haydn's style===\nHaydn's early work dates from a period in which the compositional style of the High [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (seen in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]) had gone out of fashion. This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn, born 18 years before the death of Bach, was himself one of the musical explorers of this time.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Rosen|1997|p=57}}. \"[T]he period from 1750 to 1775 was penetrated by eccentricity, hit-or-miss experimentation, resulting in works which are still difficult to accept today because of their oddities\". Similar remarks are made by {{Harvtxt|Hughes|1970|pp=111\u201312}}.</ref> An older contemporary whose work Haydn acknowledged as an important influence was [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]].<ref name=\"Geiringer30\" />\n\nTracing Haydn's work over the six decades in which it was produced (roughly from 1749 to 1802), one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication, which developed as Haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues. Several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of Haydn's musical style.\n\nIn the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as \"[[Sturm und Drang]]\" (\"storm and stress\"). This term is taken from [[Sturm und Drang|a literary movement]] of about the same time, though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years.{{efn|See {{Harvtxt|Webster|2002|p=18}}: \"the term has been criticized: taken from the title of a play of 1776 by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|Maximilian Klinger]], it properly pertains to a literary movement of the middle and late 1770s rather than a musical one of about 1768\u20131772\".}} The musical language of this period is similar to what went before, but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive, especially in the works in minor keys. James Webster describes the works of this period as \"longer, more passionate, and more daring\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Webster|2002|p=18}}</ref> Some of the most famous compositions of this time are the [[Symphony No. 44 (Haydn)|\"Trauer\" (Mourning) Symphony No. 44]], [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|\"Farewell\" Symphony No. 45]], the Piano Sonata in C minor (Hob. XVI/20, L. 33), and the [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|six \"Sun\" Quartets Op. 20]], all from c. 1771\u201372. It was also around this time that Haydn became interested in writing [[fugue]]s in the Baroque style, and three of the Op. 20 quartets end with a fugue.\n\nFollowing the climax of the \"Sturm und Drang\", Haydn returned to a lighter, more overtly entertaining style. There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes [[trumpet]]s and [[timpani]]. These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn's professional duties, which moved him away from \"pure\" music and toward the production of [[Opera buffa|comic operas]]. Several of the operas were Haydn's own work (see [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn]]); these are seldom performed today. Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works,{{sfn|Webster|Feder|2001|loc=section 3.iii}} which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade.\n[[File:HaydnPlaying.jpg|thumb|350x350px|''Joseph Haydn Playing Quartets'']]\nIn 1779, an important change in Haydn's contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer. This may have encouraged Haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of \"pure\" music. The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|six Op. 33 String Quartets]], announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in \"a new and completely special way\".{{efn|Original German \"Neu, gantz besonderer Art\"; Sisman (1993, 219)}} [[Charles Rosen]] has argued that this assertion on Haydn's part was not just sales talk but meant quite seriously, and he points out a number of important advances in Haydn's compositional technique that appear in these quartets, advances that mark the advent of the [[Classical music era|Classical]] style in full flower. These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of \"Classical [[counterpoint]]\" in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity. These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Op. 33.{{efn|Rosen's case that Opus 33 represents a \"revolution in style\" (1971 and 1997, 116) can be found in chapter III.1 of {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}}. For dissenting views, see {{Harvtxt|Larsen|1980|p=102}} and {{Harvtxt|Webster|1991}}. For discussion of the development of the same trend in Haydn's style in the symphonies that preceded the Opus 33 quartets see {{harvtxt|Rosen|1988|pp=181\u2013186}}.}}\n\nIn the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his \"popular style\", a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure.{{efn|Rosen discusses the popular style in ch. VI.1 of {{harvtxt|Rosen|1997}}.}} An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of [[folk music|folk]] or folk-like material (see [[Haydn and folk music]]). Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales. In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure.{{sfn|Rosen|1997|pp=333\u2013337}} Haydn's popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work, including the twelve [[London symphonies|\"London\" symphonies]], the late quartets and piano trios, and the two late [[oratorio]]s.\n\nThe return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn's career. Although his musical style evolved little, his intentions as a composer changed. While he had been a servant, and later a busy entrepreneur, Haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion, with frequent deadlines. As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity. This is reflected in the subject matter of ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' (1798) and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music. Haydn's new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work: both oratorios took him over a year to complete. Haydn once remarked that he had worked on ''The Creation'' so long because he wanted it to last.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geiringer|1982|p=158}}</ref>\n\nThe change in Haydn's approach was important in the [[history of classical music traditions|history of classical music]], as other composers were soon following his lead. Notably, Beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high.{{efn|For discussion, see [[Antony Hopkins]] (1981) ''The Nine Symphonies of Beethoven'', Heinemann, London, pp. 7\u20138.}}\n\n===Identifying Haydn's works===\n\n[[Anthony van Hoboken]] prepared a comprehensive catalogue of Haydn's works. The [[Hoboken catalogue]] assigns a catalog number to each work, called its Hoboken number (abbreviated H. or Hob.). These Hoboken numbers are often used in identifying Haydn's compositions.\n\nHaydn's string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but they are usually identified instead by their [[opus number]]s, which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together. For example, the string quartet [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76 No. 3 (\"Emperor\")|Opus 76, No. 3]] is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as Opus 76.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Classical music|Opera}}\n\n===Works===\n* [[List of compositions by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of concertos by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of operas by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of piano trios by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of solo piano compositions by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn]]\n* [[List of symphonies by Joseph Haydn]]\n\n===Contemporaries===\n* [[Marianna Martines|Marianne von Martines]]{{spaced ndash}}as a child, one of Haydn's first students; as an adult, a friend and eminent musician.\n* [[List of Austrians in music]]\n\n===Other topics===\n* [[Joseph Haydn's ethnicity]]{{Spaced ndash}}was Haydn [[Croats|Croatian]]?\n* [[Haydn's birthplace]]\n* [[List of residences of Joseph Haydn|List of Haydn's residences]]\n* [[Mannersdorf am Leithagebirge]], visited by Haydn during the summer of 1753.\n* [[Evolution of timpani in the 18th and 19th centuries#Haydn's timpani writing|Haydn's writing for timpani]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Biographical sources===\n* {{cite book |last=Dies |first=Albert Christoph |authorlink=Albert Christoph Dies |year=1810 |title=Biographische Nachrichten von Joseph Haydn nach m\u00fcndlichen Erz\u00e4hlungen desselben entworfen und herausgegeben |trans-title=Biographical Accounts of Joseph Haydn, written and edited from his own spoken narratives |location=Vienna |publisher=Camesinaische Buchhandlung}} English translation in: {{cite book |last=Dies |first=Albert Christoph |chapter=Biographical Accounts of Joseph Haydn |year=1963 |editor-last=Gotwals |editor-first=Vernon |title=Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits |others=(translation by Vernon Gotwals) |location=Milwaukee |publisher=Univ. of Wisconsin Press |isbn=0-299-02791-0 |ref=CITEREFGotwals1963 }} One of the first biographies of Haydn, written on the basis of 30 interviews carried out during the composer's old age.\n* {{cite book |last=[[Ludwig Finscher|Finscher]] | first= Ludwig | year=2000|title=Joseph Haydn und seine Zeit|publisher=Laaber-Verlag |place=Laaber|isbn=3-921518-94-6}} Highly detailed discussion of life and work; in German.\n* {{cite book|last=Geiringer|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Geiringer|last2=Geiringer|first2=Irene|title=Haydn: A Creative Life in Music|publisher=University of California|edition=3rd|year=1982|isbn=0-520-04316-2|ref={{harvid|Geiringer|1982}}|url=https://archive.org/details/haydncreativelif00geir_0}} The first edition was published in 1946 with Karl Geiringer as the sole author.\n* {{cite book|title=Haydn: Two Contemporary Portraits|translator=Vernon Gotwals |editor=Vernon Gotwals | place=Milwaukee | year= 1963 | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-02791-0 | last=Griesinger| first=Georg August| authorlink=Georg August Griesinger| chapter=Biographical Notes Concerning Joseph Haydn}} A translation from the original German: {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Griesinger|1810}}|reference=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sGhDAAAAcAAJ ''Biographische Notizen \u00fcber Joseph Haydn''] (1810).

These audiobooks were described as the 'guide to...' series, covering several topics. As of May 2011, there are 12 \"Guides\" in total: Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law & Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2010]], and [[Comic Relief]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The+ricky+gervais+guide+to|title=The Ricky Gervais Guide to...|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> The conversations typically begin on topic, but constantly stray away from the topic at hand.\n\n===Television===\n====Early television appearances====\n[[File:RickyGervaisBAFTA07.jpg|thumb|upright|Gervais at the [[60th British Academy Film Awards]] in 2007]]\nGervais has contributed to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-winning ''[[The Sketch Show]]'' (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV on-screen debut came in September 1998 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s ''Comedy Lab'' series of pilots. His one-off show ''[[Golden Years (TV programme)|Golden Years]]'' focused on a [[David Bowie]]-obsessed character called Clive Meadows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa|title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nGervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced [[Ali G]]'s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' in early 1999, in which his character used as many [[Profanity|expletive]]s as was possible and produced an inordinate number of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was [[Mackenzie Crook]], later a co-star of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]''. It was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.\n\nThroughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'' and ''The [[Jim Tavar\u00e9|Jim Tavare]] Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924202642/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====''The Office''====\n{{Main|The Office (UK TV series)}}\n''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' started when [[Stephen Merchant]], while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, and influenced by other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

SpongeBob lives in a submerged [[pineapple]] with his pet [[snail]], [[Gary the Snail|Gary]]. His unlimited optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those around him as happier than they are.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.
