Lagarde", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=April 2020}}\n'''Maurice L.''' \"'''Mel'''\" '''Lagarde III''' is a [[New Orleans]] native, born May 23, 1957, and is the son of Maurice L. Lagarde II and Ollie \"Jean\", Lagarde. As a fifth-generation New Orleanian, he has deep familial and academic roots in Louisiana.\u00a0 Lagarde is currently president and chief executive officer of HCA MidAmerica Division, a part of [[HCA Healthcare]], one of the nation's leading providers of healthcare services comprising 185 hospitals and approximately 1,800 sites of care in 20 states and the United Kingdom. The HCA MidAmerica Division is a multi-market healthcare network that spans [[Kansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Missouri]]. The network includes 15 hospitals, outpatient centers, physician clinics, and eight ambulatory surgery centers serving an array of urban, suburban and rural communities. The Missouri and Kansas hospitals comprise HCA Midwest Health \u2014 where Lagarde is president \u2014 which is one of the Greater Kansas City area's largest private employers and the leading healthcare system in both states. Prior to his role as HCA MidAmerica Division president, Lagarde served as president of HCA Healthcare's Delta Division and chief operating officer of HCA's Gulf Coast Division in Texas from 1994 to 1995. He also served in various hospital leadership positions at several HCA Healthcare hospitals in Georgia, Virginia and Texas.\n\n==Early life and education== \nLagarde finished his secondary education at [[Brother Martin High School|Brother Martin New Orleans Boys High School]]. Upon graduation in 1975, he attended [[Tulane University]] where, in 1979, he received a bachelor's degree in economics, graduating Summa Cum Laude, and a master's degree in public health from [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|Tulane's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine]] in 1981. In 2001, Lagarde was named Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine Distinguished Alumnus of the Year. After serving as a [[Residency (medicine)|Resident]] in Administration at HCA Doctors Hospital, he began a 36-year career, working in a variety of leadership positions with HCA Healthcare.\n\n==Community involvement==\n\nIn 1995, with the support of the New Orleans [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans|Archdiocese]], Lagarde was a founding charter members of Legatus International in New Orleans, the world's premier membership organization for [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] business leaders, providing access to the best minds in the Catholic Church, business world and society addressing the important topics such as faith, family and business. Lagarde also served as board chair and president of the New Orleans Chapter of Legatus, the 22nd in the Legatus family.\n\nLagarde was a founding member of Woman's New Life Center in Metairie, Louisiana, a healthcare center dedicated to providing women facing an unplanned pregnancy a safe and welcoming environment. The center offers medical, emotional and practical support and advice, helping women face a better future for their unborn child.\u00a0 Additionally, Lagarde is actively involved in serving numerous civic organizations in New Orleans in various capacities, including as past chairman of the board of directors of the [[New Orleans Police Department|New Orleans Police Foundation]]; on the executive committee of the [[The Business Council|New Orleans Business Council]]; on the executive committee \u2013 GNO, Inc.; on the board of Tulane Medical Center; on the board of Bureau of Governmental Research (BGR); as a board member of New Orleans Aviation Board-Louis Armstrong Airport; as a board member of [[Public Affairs Council|Public Affairs Research (PAR) Council]]; and as a board member of [[Audubon Nature Institute|The Audubon Nature Institute]]. In 2002, Lagarde received the YLC Role Model Award.\u00a0 He has received the Family Service Award was named in 2004 to the Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame.\n\n==Hurricane Katrina support==\n\n[[Hurricane Katrina]], and the subsequent catastrophic floodwaters resulting from levee failures, hit New Orleans and multiple HCA Delta hospitals in August 2005. \u00a0\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Tulane University Hospital and Clinic's staff, patients and family members assumed they had weathered the storm. But on the evening of Monday August 29, 2005, the city of New Orleans experienced historic flooding and by sunrise on August 30, the entire Tulane medical complex was surrounded by swirling floodwaters. What unfolded in the ensuing hours and days was a heroic and collaborative team effort, inspired by Lagarde's leadership and HCA Healthcare's support and response, to help the patients, caregivers, physicians, administrators and the healthcare system recover from the heartbreaking flooding and devastation. Noted author Bill Carey wrote the acclaimed book, \"Leave No One Behind: Hurricane Katrina and the Rescue of Tulane Hospital,\" that detailed the inside story of the largest corporately funded rescue in American history. As a result of its unprecedented experience, HCA Healthcare launched a sweeping rescue plan for Tulane that today is regarded as a textbook example of disaster response.\n\nFollowing Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans mayor formed a 17-member commission, \"[[Bring New Orleans Back Commission|Bring New Orleans Back]]\", to advise the city government on how best to rebuild and begin the long period of renewal and reconstruction. Lagarde was appointed as co-chair and considered one of the commission's most important leaders.\u00a0Throughout the vital work of \"Bring New Orleans Back\", Lagarde was a frequent guest of President George W. Bush at the White House, discussing the progress, economic impact and rebuilding the devastated region. In September 2006, King Abdullah II of Jordan toured some of the city's most devastated neighborhoods with both co-chairs of \"Bring New Orleans Back\", showing his interest in their work and progress and expressing his country's solidarity with New Orleans.\n\nLagarde's leadership and perseverance in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and its impact on healthcare \u2014 specifically, saving countless patient and employee lives from Tulane and Charity Hospital \u2014 was featured in an eight-part series in the [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|''Atlantic Journal Constitution'']] in 2006.\u00a0 Since that time, Lagarde has been personally and professionally dedicated to spreading the message of hope and prosperity of post-Katrina New Orleans and ensuring the community continues to be an economically viable and livable city.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\nLagarde is the recipient of numerous awards for his dedication to healthcare, passion for New Orleans and commitment to Catholic organizations.
