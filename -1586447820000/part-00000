Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\n\n===Nutrients===\n====Nitrates====\nPossible sources of [[nitrate]]s that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\n\n#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure|human manure]]\n#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]<nowiki/>s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]\n#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using renewable electricity)\n#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.\n\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928\u20134932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]</ref> Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\n\nOther options include [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid [[Soil salinity|salinization]]) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a [[non-renewable resource]]. Improvements in water [[well drilling]] technology and [[submersible pump]]s, combined with the development of [[drip irrigation]] and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.\n\nAccording to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in \"normal\" years with average rainfall.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349}}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.

The initiative was announced in the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit]]. One of the main methods is [[Agroforestry]]. Another important method is [[Conservation farming]]. One of the targets is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion of carbon annually. The coalition wants, among other, to recover with trees a territory of 5.75 million square kilometres, achieve a health tree - grass balance on a territory of 6.5 million square kilometres and increase carbon capture in a territory of 5 million square kilometres.\n \t\nThe first phase is the \"Grand African Savannah Green Up\" project.

Few farmers thought that the issue of climate change was significant enough to diminish what was causing it. Some of the farmers were worried about how a suggested carbon dioxide reduction plan would affect the agricultural sector and were suspicious of numerous government related activities, seeing them as methods in which the government could punish producers.<ref>Fleming, A.

Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\n\n===Nutrients===\n====Nitrates====\nPossible sources of [[nitrate]]s that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\n\n#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure|human manure]]\n#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]<nowiki/>s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]\n#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using renewable electricity)\n#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.\n\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928\u20134932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]</ref> Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\n\nOther options include [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349 }}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.

Much of the growth is due to women farming outside the \"male dominated field of conventional agriculture\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Policy==\nSustainable agriculture is a topic in international policy concerning its potential to reduce environmental risks. In 2011, the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change, as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change, urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy.<ref name=\"cgiar\">{{cite web |url=http://ccafs.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/climate_food_commission-spm-nov2011.pdf |title=Achieving food security in the face of climate change: Summary for policy makers from the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change |publisher=CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) |date=November 2011}}</ref> The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields, necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience.<ref name=cgiar/> It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade, including in national research and development budgets, [[land rehabilitation]], economic incentives, and infrastructure improvement.<ref name=cgiar/>\n\nIn the United States, the federal USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service provides technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation along with production agriculture.<ref name=\"nrcs\">{{cite web |author1=Ron Nichols |title=The sustainable solutions at our feet |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=STELPRDB1251507 |publisher=National Resources Conservation Service, US Department of Agriculture |accessdate=29 October 2019 |date=2019}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most important projects to mitigate climate change with agriculture and adapting agriculture to climate change at the same time, was launched in 2019 by the \"Global EverGreening Alliance\". The initiative was announced in the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit]]. One of the main methods is [[Agroforestry]]. Another important method is [[Conservation farming]]. One of the targets is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion of carbon annually. The coalition wants, among other, to recover with trees a territory of 5.75 million square kilometres, achieve a health tree - grass balance on a territory of 6.5 million square kilometres and increase carbon capture in a territory of 5 million square kilometres.\n \t\nThe first phase is the \"Grand African Savannah Green Up\" project. Already millions families implemented these methods, and the average territory covered with trees in the farms in [[Sahel]] increased to 16%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffner |first1=Erik |title=Grand African Savannah Green Up': Major $85 Million Project Announced to Scale up Agroforestry in Africa |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/agroforestry-africa-climate-summit-2641102482.html |accessdate=27 October 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Alliance work on the issue of sustainable agriculture since 2012<ref>{{cite web |title=ABOUT US |url=https://www.evergreening.org/alliance-overview/ |website=The Gloibal Evegreening Alliance |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nAmong 63 farmers interviewed in [[Tasmania]] most accepted the notion climate change was happening, but just a small segment believed that it was human related. Few farmers thought that the issue of climate change was significant enough to diminish what was causing it. Some of the farmers were worried about how a suggested carbon dioxide reduction plan would affect the agricultural sector and were suspicious of numerous government related activities, seeing them as methods in which the government could punish producers.<ref>Fleming, A. Vanclay, F.(August 3rd, 2009);Farmer responses to climate change and sustainable agriculture. A review; https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00886547/document</ref> The author James Howard Kunstler claims almost all modern technology is bad and that there cannot be sustainability unless agriculture is done in ancient traditional ways.<ref>{{cite book | last=Kunstler | first=James Howard | title=Too Much Magic; Wishful Thinking, Technology, and the Fate of the Nation |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-8021-9438-1}}</ref> Efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end. Some foresee a true sustainable [[steady state economy]] that may be very different from today's: greatly reduced energy usage, minimal [[ecological footprint]], fewer [[consumer packaged goods]], [[local purchasing]]  with [[short food supply chains]], little [[processed foods]], more home and [[community garden]]s, etc.<ref>{{Cite book | editor-last=McKibben | editor-first=D. | title=The Post Carbon Reader: Managing the 21st Century Sustainability Crisis |publisher=Watershed Media | date=2010 | isbn=978-0-9709500-6-2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Michael Carolan, a major barrier to the adoption of sustainable agriculture is its appearance of a lack of benefits. Many benefits are not visible or immediately evident, and affecting changes such as lower rates of soil and [[nutrient]] loss, improved [[soil structure]] and higher levels of beneficial [[microorganism]]s takes time.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2186/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=958e803d-f9e5-4035-82f5-f53d11a21c82%40sessionmgr101&bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=21972513&db=a9h |title=Do You See What I See?

The Ninth Circuit noted that although the LCFS had been repealed and replaced in 2015, the \u201ccore structure\u201d of the regulations (with their emphasis on fuels\u2019 lifecycle emissions) and claims was the same as it had been when the court decided the first appeal. The Ninth Circuit therefore ruled that its prior decision on the 2011 and 2012 versions of the LCFS precluded the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the 2015 LCFS constituted impermissible extraterritorial regulation and that it facially discriminated against interstate commerce in ethanol and crude oil. \n\nRegarding extraterritoriality, the court rejected the argument that the LCFS was motivated by a concern for environmental harms in other states, stating: \u201cCalifornia did not enact the LCFS because it thinks that it is the state that knows how best to protect Iowa\u2019s farms, Maine\u2019s fisheries, or Michigan\u2019s lakes.\u201d The court said California's interest in lifecycle emissions arose from its concern about climate change's impacts on California and that the LCFS was therefore \u201ca classic exercise of police power.\u201d \n\nRegarding facial discrimination, the court said that California was attempting \u201cto address a vitally important environmental issue with vast potential consequences\u201d and that it could not offer \u201ca potential solution to the perverse incentives that would otherwise undermine any attempt to assess and regulate the carbon impact of different fuels \u2026 without the ability to differentiate the different production processes and power generation that are used to produce those fuels.\u201d \n\nThe Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cstructural federalism\u201d claim was precluded by the court's recent decision on Oregon's Clean Fuel Program, in which the Ninth Circuit concluded that any such claim would be contingent on a finding that the program regulated extraterritorially. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that \u201c[t]here is simply no reason to search beyond the Commerce Clause for the Constitution\u2019s limits on the ability of states to affect interstate commerce.\u201d In addition, the Ninth Circuit found that the plaintiffs had failed to take advantage of the opportunity given by its earlier decision on the 2011 and 2012 LCFS to show that the LCFS was actually intended \u201cto prop up local fuel interests\u201d and discriminate against interstate commerce. \n\nThe court also dismissed claims against the 2011 and 2012 versions of the LCFS as moot because the challenged laws were no longer in effect and plaintiffs\u2019 obligations under the earlier versions had been discharged.<ref>[[Arnold & Porter]] LLP.

State of Georgia''''', [[Case citation|S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18]] (1998){{ref|citation}} was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]].  Powell was charged with a complaint in which he had performed non-consensual oral sex upon his wife's 17-year-old niece in his house.  The jury [[acquit]]ted him of the non-consensual portion of the complaint, but [[convicted]] him of consensual sodomy.\n\nIn its appeal, the defense argued the statute was unconstitutional; the state argued that a conviction such as this was explicitly upheld by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', [[Case citation|478 U.S. 186]] (1986).\n\nIn ''Bowers'', the Attorney General of Georgia had conceded that the sodomy law could not be applied to married heterosexuals, given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.  Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had observed in his ''Bowers'' dissent that ''[[Eisenstadt v.

State of Georgia''''', [[Case citation|S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18]] (1998){{ref|citation}} was a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]].  Powell was charged with a complaint in which he had performed non-consensual oral sex upon his wife's 17-year-old niece in his house.  The jury [[acquit]]ted him of the non-consensual portion of the complaint, but [[convicted]] him of consensual sodomy.\n\nIn its appeal, the defense argued the statute was unconstitutional; the state argued that a conviction such as this was explicitly upheld by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', [[Case citation|478 U.S. 186]] (1986).\n\nIn ''Bowers'', the Attorney General of Georgia had conceded that the sodomy law could not be applied to married heterosexuals, given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.  Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] had observed in his ''Bowers'' dissent that ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]'' had extended ''Griswold'' to unmarried heterosexuals, so the sodomy law should not apply to unmarried heterosexuals either.\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court struck down the sodomy statute by a vote of 6-1. The Court found that the individual's right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution are stronger and broader than those in the U.S. Constitution's [[Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].

City of South Portland''''' is a [[lawsuit]] filed on February 6, 2015, in the [[United States District Court for the District of Maine]]. It involved a pipeline operator's challenge to [[South Portland, Maine]]'s local ordinance prohibiting loading crude oil onto tankers and the construction of new structures for that purpose on the grounds that it violates the [[dormant Commerce Clause]] and [[Foreign Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. \n\n==Decision==\n\nAfter a four-day bench trial, the court ruled on August 24, 2018 that the local ordinance does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause or the Foreign Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\nThe federal district court for the District of Maine ruled that the City of South Portland's ordinance prohibiting the loading of crude oil onto tankers and related activities and structures did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause or the Foreign Commerce Clause. The ordinance, known as the \u201cClean Skies Ordinance,\u201d was adopted after a pipeline operator (the plaintiff in this case) made plans to reverse the flow in a pipeline that extended from the harbor in South Portland to refineries in Quebec so that instead of transporting crude oil from the harbor to the refineries, the pipeline could transport crude oil from Canada to the harbor for shipment. Concerns regarding local pollution and other local impacts were raised in response to these plans, as well as concerns regarding climate change. The Clear Skies Ordinance's stated purposes are to \u201cencourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality\u201d; \u201cto protect citizens and visitors from harmful effects caused by air pollutants\u201d; \u201cto promote a wholesome home environment\u201d; and \u201cto conserve natural resources.\u201d \n\nThe district court found that the ordinance did not regulate extraterritorially even if it had effects on the functions of the pipeline company's infrastructure outside the city. The court was not persuaded by the pipeline operator's arguments that the ordinance had an \u201cextraterritorial purpose,\u201d including arguments that members of the public had cited the pipeline's potential impacts outside the city, including concerns about continued reliance on fossil fuels causing global climate change. The court said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of evidence regarding support of the ordinance focused on local impacts and that \u201c[c]ourts have upheld other statutes more clearly motivated by extraterritorial concerns, as long as the regulatory effect did not control out-of-state transactions.\u201d \n\nThe court also found that the ordinance did not discriminate against interstate or foreign commerce on its face or in practical effect and that the operator had not shown that the primary purpose of the ordinance was to discriminate against such commerce. In making this finding, the court noted that while several members of the City Council had \u201cexpressed their desire to see reduced reliance on fossil fuels in the economy in general through more renewables,\u201d they \u201calso disclaimed an ability to accomplish that goal with an ordinance \u2026 and focused their comments on the developmental impacts within South Portland.\u201d The court also found that the ordinance did not impose burdens on foreign or interstate commerce that were clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefit. Finally, the court found that the ordinance did not impermissibly interfere with the federal government's ability to speak with \u201cone voice\u201d when regulating commerce with foreign governments.<ref>[[Arnold & Porter]] LLP.
