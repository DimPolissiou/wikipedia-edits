Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} Each team designates a scoring player (the \"jammer\"); the other four members are \"blockers\". One blocker can be designated as a \"pivot\"\u2014a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}} The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}}\n\nDuring each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another \"trip\" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any opposing blocker.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|33}}<ref group=note name=\"2019change\">Until 2019, the jammer also scored a point by passing the opposing jammer. There were 5 potential points per trip.</ref> The rules describe an \"earned\" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that blocker and a point for each opponent blocker not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack, it is a four-point scoring trip, commonly called a \"grand slam\".<ref group=note name=\"2019change\" />\n\nEach team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.\n\n===Jams===\n[[File:TwoNorthWestJammers.jpg|thumb|left|Two jammers (from the [[Oly Rollers]] and [[Rainy City Roller Dolls|Rainy City]]) race from the jammer line]]\nPlay begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the \"jammer line\" and the \"pivot line\" 30 feet in front.

Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|8}} The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|}} If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.\n\n===Blocking===\n[[File:BlockerOnPivot.ogv|thumb|An Idahoan blocker impedes a Utahn pivot at Spudtown Knockdown IV in 2013 in [[Garden City, Idaho]].]]\nA skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds.

While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.\n\nIt would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|31}} A player \"fouls out\" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|32}}\n\n===Equipment===\nPlayers skate on four-wheeled (\"quad\") roller skates,<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid [[inline skates]] for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|39}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nOffense and defense are played simultaneously,<ref>{{Cite news |title=A Local Roller Derby Team Shows Its Toughness at a Saturday Bout but Doesn't Get a Win |author=Brauns, Katie |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090412%2FSPORTS05%2F904120421%2F1041&nav}}</ref> a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics.

The strategy for a jam is not to score a lot of points but to outscore the opposition. Often, the lead jammer scores as many points as possible on the first scoring trip, and then ends the jam before the opposing jammer can begin a scoring trip.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Play: Strategy|url=http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|publisher=Atlanta Roller Girls|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095235/http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> If the jammer gets the lead but falls behind the opposing jammer, the coach may conclude that the team will be outscored and direct the jammer to call off the jam.\n*'''Passing the star''': The jammer for a team may \"pass the star\" (may perform a \"star pass\") to the pivot\u2014that is, hand the helmet cover with the star to the pivot, which turns the pivot into the jammer.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|9}} Passing the star does not nullify any earned pass of an opponent that the former jammer made, but passing the star forward never constitutes an earned pass. A jammer might pass the star because of fatigue, injury, or because the pivot is in a better position to score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com/2011/07/by-position-pivotno-1.html|title=Five Point Grand Slam: By the Position \u2013 Pivot/No. 1|first=Tripp|last=Crouse|date=15 July 2011|website=Fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> Passing the star is also sometimes referred to as \"passing the panty\", as helmet covers are sometimes known as \"panties\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derbystein.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/passing-the-panty/|title=Passing the Panty|date=9 August 2015|website=Derbystein.wordpress.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n*'''Penalty-killing''': Captained by the pivot, blockers adapt their play to a penalty situation. For example, a short-handed team may try to make the pack skate faster to slow down scoring action until the team returns to full strength.<ref name=\"LearnPivot\" /><ref group=note>Before 2013, there were \"major\" and \"minor\" penalties, the former included any player's fourth penalty, and it was strategic for a key player to deliberately commit such a penalty when it would have least effect.</ref>\n\n[[Tactic (method)|Tactics]] (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:\n*'''Walling up''': Two or more blockers skate together to make it difficult for the opposing team (especially its jammer) to maneuver. They may skate side-by-side and use a \"wide stance\" to maximize the blockade, but must not link with or grasp each other, or otherwise form an impenetrable connection.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" /> The ability to suddenly form a wall denies the opposition time to respond. A wall can inhibit, slow down, and ultimately trap the opposing jammer. An effective wall may last for an entire jam. Variations on the tactic include the following:\n**Backwards bracing, in which one skater, forward of the wall, skates backward to sight the jammer and direct teammates forming the wall.\n**A skater may break off from the wall to actively challenge the opposing jammer, with a teammate replacing the skater in the wall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Speed|title=Strategy 101: The Wall|url=https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|publisher=Rose City Rollers|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171821/https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|archive-date=14 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n**If the opposing jammer tries to pass the wall on one side, players may abandon the other side to fortify the active side of the wall.\n[[File:Roller Derby (22).jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Richter City Roller Derby|Wellington]] skaters (in purple) form a wall, limiting their opponents' movement, while their jammer (leftmost skater in purple) takes a hip whip to accelerate past the pack]]\n*'''Jammer tactics''', in response to a wall or other obstacles by the defense, include the following:\n**Pushing through gaps in the wall or inducing the wall to separate by use of physical force.\n**Evading the obstacle to one side or the other.\n**[[Juke (football move)|Juking]], where the jammer seems to be skating to one side but quickly shifts to the other side.\n**Rolling around the end of the obstacle (spinning 360\u00b0) to end up forward of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pivotstar.com/evasive-jamming-pt1/|title=Roller Derby Training: Evasive Jamming \u2013 Part One|author=Lucy Croysdill|publisher=pivotstar.com|accessdate=2018-09-29}}</ref>\n**Using teammates to impede the defense from adjusting, such as by setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]].\n**Using a '''whip''', where one or more teammates grasp the jammer's hand(s) and swing the jammer forward, transferring speed and momentum to the jammer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}</ref>\n**Using the inside curve of the track to leap out of bounds but land in bounds.\n*'''Goating''': The pack is defined as ''the largest group of in-bounds blockers, skating in proximity, containing members from both teams.''<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} In the \"goat-herding\" tactic, one team surrounds a blocker of the opposing team and then slows so that that group becomes the pack. The rest of the opposing team, skating ahead, are thus put out of play and cannot legally block the goat-herders' jammer.\n*'''Running back''' or '''recycling''': When a skater bumps the opponent jammer off the track, the jammer can only re-enter the track behind the skater. The skater skates clockwise on the track toward the rear of the engagement zone to maximize the time the jammer must spend before returning to action.<ref name=western-style>{{cite news| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/western-style-roller-derby-windy-city-rollers/Content?oid=2592374| title = Game Changer| work = [[Chicago Reader]]| date = 21 October 2010| first = Ling |last = Ma| accessdate = 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n*'''Bridging''': By separating up to 10 feet, blockers can stretch both the pack and the engagement zone, allowing teammates to keep hindering the opposition jammer. For example, in the strategy of running back (see above), coordinated action by the four skaters other than the jammer could force the opponent jammer to detour a full 40 feet before returning to action.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Falcon|first1=M|title=Derby Techniques of Interest Part 1: Knocking a jammer out of bounds and forming a bridge|url=http://www.tbayrollergirls.com/derby-techniques-of-interest/|publisher=Thunder Bay Roller Derby League|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Officials==\nWFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees and many non-skating officials (NSOs).<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|35}} Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.\n\n===Referees===\nUp to four referees skate on the inside of the track.

The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez).

Jams last two minutes unless called off prematurely.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} Each team designates a scoring player (the \"jammer\"); the other four members are \"blockers\". One blocker can be designated as a \"pivot\"\u2014a blocker who is allowed to become a jammer in the course of play.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}} The next jam may involve different players of the 15 roster players, and different selections for jammer and pivot.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}}\n\nDuring each jam, players skate counterclockwise on a circuit track. Points are scored only by a team's jammer. After breaking through the pack and skating one lap to begin another \"trip\" through the pack, the jammer scores one point for passing any opposing blocker.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|33}}<ref group=note name=\"2019change\">Until 2019, the jammer also scored a point by passing the opposing jammer. There were 5 potential points per trip.</ref> The rules describe an \"earned\" pass; notably, the jammer must be in-bounds and upright. The jammer's first earned pass scores a point for passing that blocker and a point for each opponent blocker not on the track (for instance, serving a penalty, or when the opposition did not field five players for the jam). If the jammer passes the entire pack, it is a four-point scoring trip, commonly called a \"grand slam\".<ref group=note name=\"2019change\" />\n\nEach team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to help their jammer score while hindering the opposing team's jammer.\n\n===Jams===\n[[File:TwoNorthWestJammers.jpg|thumb|left|Two jammers (from the [[Oly Rollers]] and [[Rainy City Roller Dolls|Rainy City]]) race from the jammer line]]\nPlay begins by blockers lining up on the track anywhere between the \"jammer line\" and the \"pivot line\" 30 feet in front. The jammers start behind the jammer line.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|12}} Jams begin on a single short whistle blast, upon which both jammers and blockers may begin engaging immediately.\n\n[[File:Texas Roller Derby Lonestar Rollergirls.jpg|thumb|Lonestar Rollergirls in Austin, Texas, play on a banked track. The jammer (wearing the starred helmet cover) is trying to pass a pivot (wearing a striped cover) with various blockers assisting.]]\nThe pack is the largest single group of blockers containing members of both teams skating in proximity, arranged such that each player is within 10 feet of the next.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} Blockers must maintain the pack, but can skate freely within 20 feet behind and ahead of  it, an area known as the \"engagement zone\".<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|13}}\n\nThe first jammer to break through the pack earns the status of \"lead jammer\".<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|7}} A designated referee blows the whistle twice, and skates near, and points at, the lead jammer. Once earned, lead jammer status cannot be transferred to other skaters, but certain actions (notably, being sent to the penalty box) can cause it to be lost.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|8}} The lead jammer can stop the jam at any time by repeatedly placing both hands on their hips.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|}} If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds to get on the track and line up for the next jam.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|5}} If the period expires, it does not halt a jam that is underway.\n\n===Blocking===\n[[File:BlockerOnPivot.ogv|thumb|An Idahoan blocker impedes a Utahn pivot at Spudtown Knockdown IV in 2013 in [[Garden City, Idaho]].]]\nA skater may block an opponent to impede their movement or to force them out of bounds. The blocker must be upright, skating counterclockwise, in bounds, and within the engagement zone. Blocking with hands, elbows, head, and feet is prohibited, as is contact above the shoulders or below mid-thigh, and blocking from behind.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Roller derby, Amsterdam Derby Dames against the Ruhr Pott Roller Girls from Essen, Germany.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A German pivot attempts to knock a Dutch jammer out of bounds (the yellow line) at a 2011 bout held in [[Essen, Germany]].]]\nReferees penalize rules violations.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|36}} A player receiving a penalty is removed from play to sit in a [[penalty box]] for 30 seconds of jam time.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|29}} If the jam ends during this interval, the player remains in the penalty box during the subsequent jam until the interval ends.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|30}} The penalized player's team plays short-handed, as in [[ice hockey]].\n\nHowever, the \"power jam\", derived from hockey's [[Power play (sporting term)#Ice hockey|\"power play\"]], does not cover any short-handed situation but only the case where the jammer is penalized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://svrollergirls.wordpress.com/roller-derby-a-glossary/|title=Roller derby: A glossary|publisher=Silicon Valley Roller Girls|accessdate=2018-06-26}}</ref> In this case, that team cannot score.  While the lead jammer is penalized, no one can prematurely end the jam.\n\nIt would be pointless to play if neither team could score; thus, a jammer is released from the penalty box early if the opponents' jammer enters the box. The second jammer's penalty is then only as long as the amount of time the first jammer spent in the box.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|31}} A player \"fouls out\" of the game on the seventh penalty, and is required to return to the locker room.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|32}}\n\n===Equipment===\nPlayers skate on four-wheeled (\"quad\") roller skates,<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} and are required to wear protective equipment, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and mouth guards. All current sets of roller derby rules explicitly forbid [[inline skates]] for players. (USARS requires quad skates for all skaters. WFTDA and MRDA permit inline skates for referees, but virtually all referees wear quad skates.) Individual teams may mandate additional gear, such as padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a hard-case sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|39}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nOffense and defense are played simultaneously,<ref>{{Cite news |title=A Local Roller Derby Team Shows Its Toughness at a Saturday Bout but Doesn't Get a Win |author=Brauns, Katie |newspaper=Bend Bulletin |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090412%2FSPORTS05%2F904120421%2F1041&nav}}</ref> a volatile aspect that complicates strategy and tactics.

The strategy for a jam is not to score a lot of points but to outscore the opposition. Often, the lead jammer scores as many points as possible on the first scoring trip, and then ends the jam before the opposing jammer can begin a scoring trip.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Play: Strategy|url=http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|publisher=Atlanta Roller Girls|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928095235/http://www.atlantarollergirls.com/site_admin/about/the-game/strategy|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> If the jammer gets the lead but falls behind the opposing jammer, the coach may conclude that the team will be outscored and direct the jammer to call off the jam.\n*'''Passing the star''': The jammer for a team may \"pass the star\" (may perform a \"star pass\") to the pivot\u2014that is, hand the helmet cover with the star to the pivot, which turns the pivot into the jammer.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|9}} Passing the star does not nullify any earned pass of an opponent that the former jammer made, but passing the star forward never constitutes an earned pass. A jammer might pass the star because of fatigue, injury, or because the pivot is in a better position to score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com/2011/07/by-position-pivotno-1.html|title=Five Point Grand Slam: By the Position \u2013 Pivot/No. 1|first=Tripp|last=Crouse|date=15 July 2011|website=Fivepointgrandslam.blogspot.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> Passing the star is also sometimes referred to as \"passing the panty\", as helmet covers are sometimes known as \"panties\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://derbystein.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/passing-the-panty/|title=Passing the Panty|date=9 August 2015|website=Derbystein.wordpress.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n*'''Penalty-killing''': Captained by the pivot, blockers adapt their play to a penalty situation. For example, a short-handed team may try to make the pack skate faster to slow down scoring action until the team returns to full strength.<ref name=\"LearnPivot\" /><ref group=note>Before 2013, there were \"major\" and \"minor\" penalties, the former included any player's fourth penalty, and it was strategic for a key player to deliberately commit such a penalty when it would have least effect.</ref>\n\n[[Tactic (method)|Tactics]] (deliberate conceptual tasks in support of the strategy) may include the following:\n*'''Walling up''': Two or more blockers skate together to make it difficult for the opposing team (especially its jammer) to maneuver. They may skate side-by-side and use a \"wide stance\" to maximize the blockade, but must not link with or grasp each other, or otherwise form an impenetrable connection.<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" /> The ability to suddenly form a wall denies the opposition time to respond. A wall can inhibit, slow down, and ultimately trap the opposing jammer. An effective wall may last for an entire jam. Variations on the tactic include the following:\n**Backwards bracing, in which one skater, forward of the wall, skates backward to sight the jammer and direct teammates forming the wall.\n**A skater may break off from the wall to actively challenge the opposing jammer, with a teammate replacing the skater in the wall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bump|first=Speed|title=Strategy 101: The Wall|url=https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|publisher=Rose City Rollers|accessdate=22 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171821/https://www.rosecityrollers.com/strategy-101-the-wall/|archive-date=14 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n**If the opposing jammer tries to pass the wall on one side, players may abandon the other side to fortify the active side of the wall.\n[[File:Roller Derby (22).jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Richter City Roller Derby|Wellington]] skaters (in purple) form a wall, limiting their opponents' movement, while their jammer (leftmost skater in purple) takes a hip whip to accelerate past the pack]]\n*'''Jammer tactics''', in response to a wall or other obstacles by the defense, include the following:\n**Pushing through gaps in the wall or inducing the wall to separate by use of physical force.\n**Evading the obstacle to one side or the other.\n**[[Juke (football move)|Juking]], where the jammer seems to be skating to one side but quickly shifts to the other side.\n**Rolling around the end of the obstacle (spinning 360\u00b0) to end up forward of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pivotstar.com/evasive-jamming-pt1/|title=Roller Derby Training: Evasive Jamming \u2013 Part One|author=Lucy Croysdill|publisher=pivotstar.com|accessdate=2018-09-29}}</ref>\n**Using teammates to impede the defense from adjusting, such as by setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]].\n**Using a '''whip''', where one or more teammates grasp the jammer's hand(s) and swing the jammer forward, transferring speed and momentum to the jammer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joulwan|first=Melissa|title=Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track - p 95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGizDBbRfjYC&pg=PA95 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416538554|date=2007-04-06}}</ref>\n**Using the inside curve of the track to leap out of bounds but land in bounds.\n*'''Goating''': The pack is defined as ''the largest group of in-bounds blockers, skating in proximity, containing members from both teams.''<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|11}} In the \"goat-herding\" tactic, one team surrounds a blocker of the opposing team and then slows so that that group becomes the pack. The rest of the opposing team, skating ahead, are thus put out of play and cannot legally block the goat-herders' jammer.\n*'''Running back''' or '''recycling''': When a skater bumps the opponent jammer off the track, the jammer can only re-enter the track behind the skater. The skater skates clockwise on the track toward the rear of the engagement zone to maximize the time the jammer must spend before returning to action.<ref name=western-style>{{cite news| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/western-style-roller-derby-windy-city-rollers/Content?oid=2592374| title = Game Changer| work = [[Chicago Reader]]| date = 21 October 2010| first = Ling |last = Ma| accessdate = 31 October 2010}}</ref>\n*'''Bridging''': By separating up to 10 feet, blockers can stretch both the pack and the engagement zone, allowing teammates to keep hindering the opposition jammer. For example, in the strategy of running back (see above), coordinated action by the four skaters other than the jammer could force the opponent jammer to detour a full 40 feet before returning to action.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Falcon|first1=M|title=Derby Techniques of Interest Part 1: Knocking a jammer out of bounds and forming a bridge|url=http://www.tbayrollergirls.com/derby-techniques-of-interest/|publisher=Thunder Bay Roller Derby League|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Officials==\nWFTDA bouts are officiated by three to seven skating referees and many non-skating officials (NSOs).<ref name=\"WFTDARules\" />{{rp|35}} Volunteer leagues adapt when fewer than the optimal number of officials are present.\n\n===Referees===\nUp to four referees skate on the inside of the track.

The other teams included the Maniacs (led by Guru Drew), Bad Attitude (led by Ms. Georgia Hase), the Rockers (led by DJ Terringo and consisting of skaters who were also professional rock and roll musicians), and Hot Flash (led by Juan Valdez Lopez).

It quickly gained the reputation for being a source of employment in 1740 when a local jahagirdar, Naro Shankar Raje Bahadur, started building a fort in the area. As the fort took 25 years, a sizeable number of Muslim workers and artisans from places like Surat and northern India settled in the area.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAfter the British capture of the [[Malegaon fort]] in 1818, Muslims from Hyderabad migrated to the region. The 1857 revolt saw many Muslims from the north move here, and the pattern repeated over the years. Malegaon, with its growing Muslim presence, became something of a shelter and a source of employment for the community whenever it faced reversals.

The era of power looms in the city emerged after 1935. Malegaon was a traditional handloom-weaving centre in Maharashtra. Most of the preparatory work before weaving like starching the yarn, transferring it over the tubes, and preparing tanabana was done by the women. Even after power looms were introduced, women continued to help men in the weaving procedure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of power looms, the cloth industry in Malegaon flourished due to increased productivity. Many people bought power looms and very few were left with handlooms. It has an estimated 3 lakh power looms producing about 1 crore (10 million) meters of cloth every day. It attracts workers from around India, majority of migrants from U.P., Khandesh and Deccan, due to lower cost of living and Muslim dominance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn recent times, the power loom industry is going through difficult phase due to factors like fluctuating government policies, frequent electricity outage, lack of political will, middleman at every stage and reluctance to migrate to advanced machines.<ref>Smriti Irani has taken charge as Textile Minister when the industry is in its worst phase http://ummid.com/news/2016/July/13.07.2016/smriti-irani-takes-charge-as-textile-minister.html</ref> Though it is still a major source of employment, most of workers struggle to make a living. As a result, the city has observed a change in migration pattern wherein the worker prefer to move to metros compared to Malegaon for better and stable job opportunities.\n\nMalegaon of late{{when|date=July 2019}} has been diversifying and new industries are rapidly expanding. PVC pipe manufacturing is one such industry. Malegaon is soon becoming a regional centre for PVC pipes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Mollywood film industry ===\n\nMalegaon's notoriously wacky film spoof industry has introduced many classic Hollywood and Bollywood characters to the satellite town of Malegaon by giving them its quintessential dialogue, looks, circumstances, and food. After having conquered local imagination with such cult spoofs as ''Malegaon ki Sholay'', ''Malegaon ke Karan arjun'', ''Malegaon ka James Bond'' and ''[[Supermen of Malegaon]],'' the impoverished film-maker{{who|date=February 2018}} invaded national television with his second version of ''[[Malegaon Ka Chintu]]'', ''Chintu ban gaya Gentleman'', a mute comedy based loosely on [[Mr. Bean]].\n\nA crew named Sky View Pictures in Malegaon produce and make movies.

They earn a livelihood selling vegetables, working in the textile factories in Malegaon, or running eateries or tea stalls. In the credits their names reflect their professions, like Salim Electrician, Iqbal Chaiwala, badshah khan, or Zaheer Cyclewala. Since Mollywood films are not released all over India, they don't make much money. The urge to make the movies is almost always personal passion. ''Malegoan Ke Karan Arjun,'' for example, was made on a budget of Rs 50,000 and made around Rs 2.50 lakh.\n\nIn the early days of Mollywood, local actors from Malegaon were excited to work in film with no fees. Later it was a trend that actors were not paid for the work. Owner of \u201cADD Films\u201d production Atul Dusane was the first in Malegaon who started to pay actors, crew, and cast. Since then actors are being paid for the work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe male actors are locals, Some of the biggest stars, such as superstar Sarthak Nagpal, jainya, shafique chotu, badshah khan, ramzan shahrukh. but Malegaon's conservative society does not allow local women to act in films, so actresses are mostly from Jalgaon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nVillages near Malegaon and towards Satana, Nampur Talwade and vadel are indulged into agriculture and major producers of [[onion]]s.

The era of power looms in the city emerged after 1935. Malegaon was a traditional handloom-weaving centre in Maharashtra. Most of the preparatory work before weaving like starching the yarn, transferring it over the tubes, and preparing tanabana was done by the women. Even after power looms were introduced, women continued to help men in the weaving procedure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWith the introduction of power looms, the cloth industry in Malegaon flourished due to increased productivity. Many people bought power looms and very few were left with handlooms. It has an estimated 3 lakh power looms producing about 1 crore (10 million) meters of cloth every day. It attracts workers from around India, majority of migrants from U.P., Khandesh and Deccan, due to lower cost of living and Muslim dominance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn recent times, the power loom industry is going through difficult phase due to factors like fluctuating government policies, frequent electricity outage, lack of political will, middleman at every stage and reluctance to migrate to advanced machines.<ref>Smriti Irani has taken charge as Textile Minister when the industry is in its worst phase http://ummid.com/news/2016/July/13.07.2016/smriti-irani-takes-charge-as-textile-minister.html</ref> Though it is still a major source of employment, most of workers struggle to make a living. As a result, the city has observed a change in migration pattern wherein the worker prefer to move to metros compared to Malegaon for better and stable job opportunities.\n\nMalegaon of late{{when|date=July 2019}} has been diversifying and new industries are rapidly expanding. PVC pipe manufacturing is one such industry. Malegaon is soon becoming a regional centre for PVC pipes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Mollywood film industry ===\n\nMalegaon's notoriously wacky film spoof industry has introduced many classic Hollywood and Bollywood characters to the satellite town of Malegaon by giving them its quintessential dialogue, looks, circumstances, and food. After having conquered local imagination with such cult spoofs as ''Malegaon ki Sholay'', ''Malegaon ke Karan arjun'', ''Malegaon ka James Bond'' and ''[[Supermen of Malegaon]],'' the impoverished film-maker{{who|date=February 2018}} invaded national television with his second version of ''[[Malegaon Ka Chintu]]'', ''Chintu ban gaya Gentleman'', a mute comedy based loosely on [[Mr. Bean]].\n\nA crew named Sky View Pictures in Malegaon produce and make movies.

They earn a livelihood selling vegetables, working in the textile factories in Malegaon, or running eateries or tea stalls. In the credits their names reflect their professions, like Salim Electrician, Iqbal Chaiwala, badshah khan, or Zaheer Cyclewala. Since Mollywood films are not released all over India, they don't make much money. The urge to make the movies is almost always personal passion. ''Malegoan Ke Karan Arjun,'' for example, was made on a budget of Rs 50,000 and made around Rs 2.50 lakh.\n\nIn the early days of Mollywood, local actors from Malegaon were excited to work in film with no fees. Later it was a trend that actors were not paid for the work. Owner of \u201cADD Films\u201d production Atul Dusane was the first in Malegaon who started to pay actors, crew, and cast. Since then actors are being paid for the work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe male actors are locals, Some of the biggest stars, such as superstar Sarthak Nagpal, jainya, shafique chotu, badshah khan, ramzan shahrukh. but Malegaon's conservative society does not allow local women to act in films, so actresses are mostly from Jalgaon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nVillages near Malegaon and towards Satana, Nampur Talwade and vadel are indulged into agriculture and major producers of [[onion]]s.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124.

Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.
