They practised the [[ancient Iranian religion]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=314\u2013315}}\n\nA group of Scythian tribes, the [[Sarmatians]], known as the [[Alans]] (i.e. \"[[Aryans]]\", through a common internal consonant shift, i.e. \"Iranians\"{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315, note 1}}) from the first century onwards, migrated into [[Europe]]. Allied with the Germanic [[Goths]], the Alans penetrated west into [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and other territories under the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans tried to manage the threat by hiring them as mercenaries in the cavalry, or, particularly in France, by buying them off as landed gentry. Many toponyms in France, such as Alainville, Alaincourt, Alen\u00e7on, and others, testify that they were territorial possessions of Alan families. Alan equestrian culture formed the basis of Medieval [[chivalry]], and thus had a significant role in the development of western European culture.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315}}\n\nWhile most of the Scythians assimilated into other ethnic groups by the Middle Ages, the Alans of the [[Caucasus]] maintained a distinct identity and continued to dominate the area, so that the [[Byzantine Empire]] recognised them as an independent allied kingdom. Through their relations with the Byzantines and missionaries from [[Georgia]] in the south, the Alan aristocracy adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] during the tenth century. This, however, had little effect on the general Alan population, so that the thirteenth-century Flemish traveller [[William of Rubruck]] reported that \"they knew nothing (of Christianity) apart from the name of Christ\". The [[Ossetians]] are the sole modern population culturally and linguistically descending from the Alans, and they have preserved beliefs and rituals likely dating back to Scythian religion, even though through waves of partial [[syncretism|syncretisation]] with Christianity.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=316}}\n\nAfter the conquests of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the Caucasus during the mid-thirteenth century, contacts between the Alans and Eastern Orthodox religious authorities ceased completely, and their superficial Christianisation was stopped. There is evidence that between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, shrines which were apparently built in honour of Christian saints were converted to indigenous Pagan use.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}} The [[Russian Empire]]'s expansion in the Caucasus by the end of the eighteenth century brought with itself Russian Orthodox missionaries who sought to \"re-Christianise\" the Ossetians. Their efforts had had limited success by the time when they were completely obliterated by the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, which introduced the peoples of the Caucasus into the rapid processes of industrialisation, modernisation and urbanisation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Traditional and new religion===\nThe Ossetian people are today split between two states: the Republic of [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]] within [[Russia]], and the neighbouring state of [[South Ossetia]]. The religion has experienced an organised revival since the 1980s. In the Ossetian case, certain traditions of folk religion had survived with unbroken continuity, and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revival religion to overcome the crisis of identity of the Ossetian people, based on [[ethnic nationalism]] and opposition to both [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], perceived as foreign, and opposed as well to [[Islam]], professed by the neighboring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and by a small minority of Ossetians.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=202\u2013207|ps=: \"Since the turn of the 1980s, a growth of Neo-Paganism has been observed in the Middle Volga region, in North Ossetia-Alaniia, and in Abkhazia. Pagan traditions had never disappeared there completely and, in contrast to the Slavic and Baltic regions, there was no need to invent too much by reference to books, as almost all the resources were intact there. Thus, in these regions, interest in Paganism developed in two different environments: firstly, in the countryside with its unbroken continuity of traditional folk beliefs, and secondly, in the urbanized areas where local, highly secularized intellectuals began to construct a new synthetic religion in order to overcome a crisis of identity. In the latter case, this was a manifestation of local ethnic nationalism resisting Russian Orthodoxy as a \"religion of exploiters\". [...] Contemporary Neo-Paganism is constituted by two different branches\u2014one of a \"bookish\" approach which is artificially cultivated by urbanized intellectuals who have lost their links with folk tradition, and the other, more authentic, is of a rural movement based on a continuity rooted in the remote past. The first dominates among the Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Armenians and can be defined as an \"invention of tradition\", after Eric Hobsbawm (1983). A more complex pattern can be observed among the ethnic groups of the Middle Volga River region as well as among the Ossetians and Abkhazians, where both tendencies are interacting with one another.\"}}\n\nThere are attempts to turn traditional local gods into objects of national worship in North Ossetia\u2013Alania. For example, in former times, a grove was devoted to the local god Khetag. After the [[1991\u201392 South Ossetia War|clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991\u20131992]], a glade near the wood was turned into a place for pan-Ossetian worship, including religious and political rituals, with activities supervised by the Great Council of Ossetian Priests (''Styr-nykhas''), a non-governmental committee established in 1993.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}} The Khetag celebration was approved by the 1990s president of North Ossetia\u2013Alania as a national holiday. A special foundation was established in order to raise funds for the reconstruction of the site, and since 1994 a big yearly sacrifice is arranged at the Khetag shrine.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==Relevance for Slavs and other Indo-Europeans==\n[[File:089 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Rekom Temple in the [[Tsey]] area, [[Alagirsky District]], [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]].]]\nIn 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of [[Moscow State University]], led by the Russian thinker [[Alexander Dugin]], a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history. Among participants there was, among others, Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' religious organisation of Assianism. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' organisation was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because \"what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage\".<ref name=\"Dugin-Assianism\">{{cite web |title=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0414\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d: \u041e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0443 |trans-title=Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit |date=7 October 2009 |website=iratta.com |url=http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}}</ref> Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth \"addressed to the whole world\".<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n==Theology and cosmology==\n[[File:North Ossetia.

Their name \"Scythians\" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]], \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 ''Skuthoi'', meaning the \"archers\", a skill for which they were known and feared. They left a rich cultural legacy, particularly in the form of gold jewellery, frequently found in the \"[[kurgan]]\" burials associated with them. They practised the [[ancient Iranian religion]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=314\u2013315}}\n\nA group of Scythian tribes, the [[Sarmatians]], known as the [[Alans]] (i.e. \"[[Aryans]]\", through a common internal consonant shift, i.e. \"Iranians\"{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315, note 1}}) from the first century onwards, migrated into [[Europe]]. Allied with the Germanic [[Goths]], the Alans penetrated west into [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and other territories under the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans tried to manage the threat by hiring them as mercenaries in the cavalry, or, particularly in France, by buying them off as landed gentry. Many toponyms in France, such as Alainville, Alaincourt, Alen\u00e7on, and others, testify that they were territorial possessions of Alan families. Alan equestrian culture formed the basis of Medieval [[chivalry]], and thus had a significant role in the development of western European culture.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315}}\n\nWhile most of the Scythians assimilated into other ethnic groups by the Middle Ages, the Alans of the [[Caucasus]] maintained a distinct identity and continued to dominate the area, so that the [[Byzantine Empire]] recognised them as an independent allied kingdom. Through their relations with the Byzantines and missionaries from [[Georgia]] in the south, the Alan aristocracy adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] during the tenth century. This, however, had little effect on the general Alan population, so that the thirteenth-century Flemish traveller [[William of Rubruck]] reported that \"they knew nothing (of Christianity) apart from the name of Christ\". The [[Ossetians]] are the sole modern population culturally and linguistically descending from the Alans, and they have preserved beliefs and rituals likely dating back to Scythian religion, even though through waves of partial [[syncretism|syncretisation]] with Christianity.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=316}}\n\nAfter the conquests of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the Caucasus during the mid-thirteenth century, contacts between the Alans and Eastern Orthodox religious authorities ceased completely, and their superficial Christianisation was stopped. There is evidence that between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, shrines which were apparently built in honour of Christian saints were converted to indigenous Pagan use.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}} The [[Russian Empire]]'s expansion in the Caucasus by the end of the eighteenth century brought with itself Russian Orthodox missionaries who sought to \"re-Christianise\" the Ossetians. Their efforts had had limited success by the time when they were completely obliterated by the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, which introduced the peoples of the Caucasus into the rapid processes of industrialisation, modernisation and urbanisation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Traditional and new religion===\nThe Ossetian people are today split between two states: the Republic of [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]] within [[Russia]], and the neighbouring state of [[South Ossetia]]. The religion has experienced an organised revival since the 1980s. In the Ossetian case, certain traditions of folk religion had survived with unbroken continuity, and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revival religion to overcome the crisis of identity of the Ossetian people, based on [[ethnic nationalism]] and opposition to both [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], perceived as foreign, and opposed as well to [[Islam]], professed by the neighboring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and by a small minority of Ossetians.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=202\u2013207|ps=: \"Since the turn of the 1980s, a growth of Neo-Paganism has been observed in the Middle Volga region, in North Ossetia-Alaniia, and in Abkhazia. Pagan traditions had never disappeared there completely and, in contrast to the Slavic and Baltic regions, there was no need to invent too much by reference to books, as almost all the resources were intact there. Thus, in these regions, interest in Paganism developed in two different environments: firstly, in the countryside with its unbroken continuity of traditional folk beliefs, and secondly, in the urbanized areas where local, highly secularized intellectuals began to construct a new synthetic religion in order to overcome a crisis of identity. In the latter case, this was a manifestation of local ethnic nationalism resisting Russian Orthodoxy as a \"religion of exploiters\". [...] Contemporary Neo-Paganism is constituted by two different branches\u2014one of a \"bookish\" approach which is artificially cultivated by urbanized intellectuals who have lost their links with folk tradition, and the other, more authentic, is of a rural movement based on a continuity rooted in the remote past. The first dominates among the Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Armenians and can be defined as an \"invention of tradition\", after Eric Hobsbawm (1983). A more complex pattern can be observed among the ethnic groups of the Middle Volga River region as well as among the Ossetians and Abkhazians, where both tendencies are interacting with one another.\"}}\n\nThere are attempts to turn traditional local gods into objects of national worship in North Ossetia\u2013Alania. For example, in former times, a grove was devoted to the local god Khetag. After the [[1991\u201392 South Ossetia War|clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991\u20131992]], a glade near the wood was turned into a place for pan-Ossetian worship, including religious and political rituals, with activities supervised by the Great Council of Ossetian Priests (''Styr-nykhas''), a non-governmental committee established in 1993.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}} The Khetag celebration was approved by the 1990s president of North Ossetia\u2013Alania as a national holiday. A special foundation was established in order to raise funds for the reconstruction of the site, and since 1994 a big yearly sacrifice is arranged at the Khetag shrine.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==Relevance for Slavs and other Indo-Europeans==\n[[File:089 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Rekom Temple in the [[Tsey]] area, [[Alagirsky District]], [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]].]]\nIn 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of [[Moscow State University]], led by the Russian thinker [[Alexander Dugin]], a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history.

On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' organisation was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because \"what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage\".<ref name=\"Dugin-Assianism\">{{cite web |title=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0414\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d: \u041e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0443 |trans-title=Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit |date=7 October 2009 |website=iratta.com |url=http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}}</ref> Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth \"addressed to the whole world\".<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n==Theology and cosmology==\n[[File:North Ossetia.

In all contexts, ''Uas'' is the foundation of nobility and pure reason; ''daujita'' form both worlds and men according to this universal law, while ''uayguyta'' counter-act gods' action, and are the causes of illness and death. These forces manifest in humanity's power of consciousness and action; a man may take the side of gods or demons, and this choice manifests in this man's life and activity. If a man is able to subdue passions, not putting exclusively material motives in his actions, he becomes open to the ''Uas'', or its receptacle (\u0423\u0430\u0441\u0434\u0430\u043d \u2192 ''Uasdan'', good-spell receptacle), a wise or noble who perceives the will of God and higher spirits and receives their energy.

In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under [[receivership]] in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re-establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers, is still the matter of greatest importance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |title=PAL aims to be a five star airline in five years |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Sionil, Fil C. |date=December 7, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208105404/http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |archivedate=February 8, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== Corporate management ==\n[[File:Manilajf9595 34.JPG|thumb|The Philippine Airlines logo shown on the PNB Financial Headquarters from Roxas Boulevard]]\n[[File:Philippine_Airlines_Building.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the Philippine Airlines head office at the PNB Financial Headquarters along Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay City]]\n\nPhilippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings ({{Pse|PAL}}), a [[holding company]] responsible for the airline's operations.

There were 72 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.<ref name=\"CAPA\"/>\n\n== Branding ==\n=== Logo ===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations.  The first logo incorporated a blue oval with \"PAL\" superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star whose points intersect behind the \"A\" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead in the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed.  This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s, when it would be replaced by a second logo.\n\nThe second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, when it would be replaced by the current logo.\n\nThe current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that is shaped like a [[Sail]]boat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new [[Helvetica]] typeface was used.\n\n<gallery heights=\"65\" mode=\"packed\">\nPAL50.png|1950-1960\nPAL60.png|1960-1970\nPAL-70.png|1970-1986\n</gallery>\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[File:RP-C8785.jpg|thumb|213x213px|RP-C8785, an [[Airbus A330-343]] operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]] from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] as PR1812.]]\n\nPAL [[livery|liveries]] have undergone many incarnations.  The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name \"Philippine Air Lines\" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail.  By this time, the name \"Philippine Airlines\" was used in the livery.<ref>{{cite web|author=M.Oertle |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Philippine-Airlines/BAC-111-518FG-One-Eleven/0451320/M/ |title='&#39;PAL BAC 111-518FG One-Eleven'&#39; |publisher=Airliners.net |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery.  However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage.  Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white.\n\nThe current \"Eurowhite\" livery, first used with the [[Short 360]], was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding.  This livery, (designed by [[Landor Associates]]) has the name \"Philippines\" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface),  while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft.  The PAL logo is also painted on the [[wingtip device|winglets]] of aircraft that have them. The name \"Philippines\", instead of \"Philippine Airlines\", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] for official or state visits, is in fact the [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official air transport of the Philippine head of state]]. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''\"PR/PAL 001\"''' and the callsign '''\"PHILIPPINE ONE\"''' is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President of the Philippines.\n\nFor the airline's 70th anniversary, a special decal was placed on all of its aircraft. The sticker featured a stylized \"70\" and the words, \"Asia's first, shining through\".\n\nAs the airline celebrates its 75th anniversary, a special decal was put at the back of every aircraft. The sticker features a stylized \"75\".\n\nPAL also placed a 4-star [[Skytrax]] sticker on its aircraft to celebrate their new rating.\n\nOn February 2019, Philippine Airlines rolled out its fifth [[Airbus A350]] aircraft with a \"LoveBus\" decal that represents the 40th anniversary of partnership with Airbus and to celebrate the airline's signature heartfelt service. The kissmarked \"LoveBus\" logo was also placed on 1979 in one of PAL's [[Airbus A300]] that represents the first year of partnership with Airbus. Their \"LoveBus\" A350 rolled out from paint shop and was accepted on February 14, 2019 which was [[Valentines Day]] that time, PAL took delivered it 3 days later and was welcomed at [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/02/21/19/look-philippine-airlines-welcomes-5th-airbus-a350-900|title=LOOK: Philippine Airlines welcomes 5th Airbus A350-900|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>\n\n== Frequent flyer program ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Mabuhay Miles logo.png|thumb|left| Mabuhay Miles logo]]\n\nMabuhay Miles is the Philippine Airlines [[frequent flyer program]].

On March 31, 2007, the company's consolidated assets continued to diminish by 8% with amount equivalent to 92,837,849 PHP as against to 2006 figures. The declination of PAL's assets was primarily due to net decrease in property and equipment and advance payments to aircraft and engine manufacturers, current and other non current assets. As of March 31, 2007, other current and noncurrent assets fell by 29% to 2,960.4 million PHP and by 20% to 2,941.7 million PHP \"due to the effect of re-measurement to fair value of certain financial assets and derivative instruments\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philippineairlines.com/Images/PHI-17Q-December+2007_tcm61-6305.pdf|title=Oops!

Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Labor issues===\nPAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment.\n\nIt took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to  \"reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages.\" The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.<ref>Fonbuena, C.

This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting to lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.<ref>Manuela Jr., W.

In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under [[receivership]] in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re-establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers, is still the matter of greatest importance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |title=PAL aims to be a five star airline in five years |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Sionil, Fil C. |date=December 7, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208105404/http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |archivedate=February 8, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== Corporate management ==\n[[File:Manilajf9595 34.JPG|thumb|The Philippine Airlines logo shown on the PNB Financial Headquarters from Roxas Boulevard]]\n[[File:Philippine_Airlines_Building.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the Philippine Airlines head office at the PNB Financial Headquarters along Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay City]]\n\nPhilippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings ({{Pse|PAL}}), a [[holding company]] responsible for the airline's operations.

of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft from five families (excluding PAL Express fleet): [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A321neo]], [[Airbus A330]], its flagship [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]], and [[Boeing 777]]. There were 72 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.<ref name=\"CAPA\"/>\n\n== Branding ==\n=== Logo ===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations.  The first logo incorporated a blue oval with \"PAL\" superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star whose points intersect behind the \"A\" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead in the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed.  This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s, when it would be replaced by a second logo.\n\nThe second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, when it would be replaced by the current logo.\n\nThe current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that is shaped like a [[Sail]]boat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new [[Helvetica]] typeface was used.\n\n<gallery heights=\"65\" mode=\"packed\">\nPAL50.png|1950-1960\nPAL60.png|1960-1970\nPAL-70.png|1970-1986\n</gallery>\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[File:RP-C8785.jpg|thumb|213x213px|RP-C8785, an [[Airbus A330-343]] operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]] from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] as PR1812.]]\n\nPAL [[livery|liveries]] have undergone many incarnations.  The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name \"Philippine Air Lines\" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail.  By this time, the name \"Philippine Airlines\" was used in the livery.<ref>{{cite web|author=M.Oertle |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Philippine-Airlines/BAC-111-518FG-One-Eleven/0451320/M/ |title='&#39;PAL BAC 111-518FG One-Eleven'&#39; |publisher=Airliners.net |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery.  However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage.  Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white.\n\nThe current \"Eurowhite\" livery, first used with the [[Short 360]], was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding.  This livery, (designed by [[Landor Associates]]) has the name \"Philippines\" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface),  while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft.  The PAL logo is also painted on the [[wingtip device|winglets]] of aircraft that have them. The name \"Philippines\", instead of \"Philippine Airlines\", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] for official or state visits, is in fact the [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official air transport of the Philippine head of state]]. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''\"PR/PAL 001\"''' and the callsign '''\"PHILIPPINE ONE\"''' is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President of the Philippines.\n\nFor the airline's 70th anniversary, a special decal was placed on all of its aircraft. The sticker featured a stylized \"70\" and the words, \"Asia's first, shining through\".\n\nAs the airline celebrates its 75th anniversary, a special decal was put at the back of every aircraft.

Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Labor issues===\nPAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment.\n\nIt took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to  \"reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages.\" The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.<ref>Fonbuena, C.

This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting to lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.<ref>Manuela Jr., W.
