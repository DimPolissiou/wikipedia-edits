Rather than hiring another label, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce acceded to the demand and by 1997, Corabi departed the band and Neil returned. Many of the songs from the early writing session were used on the album and Corabi is credited on the liner notes for co-writing some of the songs.\n\nCorabi and the rest of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce made personal appearances at London's [[Hard Rock Cafe]] at a private party in February 1994 promoting their self-titled ''M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce'' album. The evening was also attended by many M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce competition winners who were invited into the VIP area to chat to Corabi, as well as the other 3 band members.\n\nCorabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.

Weeks after the performance, Corabi stated \"The album would have made it if this was under a different band name\".\n\n==Union==\nUnion was formed from recently released musician [[Bruce Kulick]] of Kiss, John Corabi, Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting. John and Bruce wrote what would become the first Union album (self titled) and proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour, to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the Union album. The second album \"Live in the Galaxy\" was a live recording with two acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third and final Union album, The Blue Room, was a more polished sound than the first studio CD. Union never officially called it quits (playing live shows every so often with guest drummers and bass players), but with Kulick playing along with [[Grand Funk Railroad]], Corabi playing with many bands, most notably [[Ratt]], and both members being tied up in solo projects, Union will probably never return to write new studio material.\n\n==ESP (Eric Singer Project)==\nESP also featured guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]], bassist [[Karl Cochran]], and drummer [[Eric Singer]]. [[Ace Frehley]] makes a special appearance on the Hendrix cover ''Foxy Lady''.\n\n==Twenty 4 Seven==\nTwenty 4 Seven, a collaboration with Corabi, drummer [[Bobby Blotzer]] ([[Ratt]], Contraband), and guitarist [[Rob Marcello]] (Ironhorse, Obsession, [[Danger Danger]]) recorded 10 hard rock tracks entitled ''Destination Everywhere'' (US, 2002).\n\n==Cardboard Vampyres==\nIn early 2004, Corabi joined [[Jerry Cantrell]]'s covers band Cardboard Vampyres. Also in the band were [[The Cult]] guitarist [[Billy Duffy]], The Cult bassist [[Chris Wyse]] and drummer Josh Howser.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeckell |first=Barry A. |url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/6063/jerry-cantrell-forms-new-band-cardboard-vampyres/ |title=Jerry Cantrell Forms New Band \u2013 Cardboard Vampyres |website=Glide Magazine |date=June 18, 2004}}</ref> The band played at various venues in the United States between 2004 and 2005.

He had multiple reasons for leaving the band. One was the fact that he was told it would be an effort much like the \"M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\" album. Secondly, he did not get along very well with [[Tracii Guns]]. He also said in an interview that \"when Nikki told me about the band, I was really into the idea of writing another CD with the heavy sound of the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album, but as we got more into recording, we had our drummer singing what was supposed to be the best song on the CD, when Nikki and Tracii were saying that our singer was the hot new thing, it just did not make sense to me.\"\n\n==Other projects==\nEarly in 2008, Corabi attended the Motley Cruise, a 4-day cruise in the Caribbean (Miami, Key West and Cozumel, Mexico) including performers such as [[Vince Neil]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Ratt]], [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]], [[Endeverafter]] and [[Lynam (band)|Lynam]]. On this cruise, Corabi joined [[Vince Neil]] on stage to perform \"Highway to Hell\" by [[AC/DC]]. This performance was a unique event as fans witnessed the two M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce vocalists share the same microphone. In August 2008, Corabi parted ways with Ratt in order to pursue his solo career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/95634 |title=RATT Working on New Material; Album Planned for Early 2009 |publisher=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{update|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Angora (band)|Angora]]'''\n* Six song demo tape\n\n'''[[The Scream (band)|The Scream]]'''\n*''[[Let It Scream]]'' (1991)\n\n'''[[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'''\n*''[[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce (album)|M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Quaternary (EP)|Quaternary]]'' EP (1994)\n*''[[Generation Swine]]'' (1997) writer, uncredited vocals\n*''[[Red, White & Cr\u00fce]] (2005)\n\n'''[[Eric Singer Project]]'''\n*''Lost and Spaced'' (1998)\n*''ESP'' (1999)\n*''Live in Japan'' (2007)\n*''ESP Live at the Marquee'' (2007)\n\n'''[[Union (band)|Union]]'''\n*''[[Union (Union album)|Union]]'' (1998)\n*''Live in the Galaxy'' (1999)\n*''[[The Blue Room (Album)|The Blue Room]]'' (2000)\n*''Do Your Own Thing Live Concert'' (2005)\n\n'''Twenty 4 Seven'''\n*''Destination Everywhere'' (2002)\n\n'''[[Brides of Destruction]]'''\n*''[[Here Come the Brides (album)|Here Comes the Brides]]'' (2004) <small>Uncredited guitar and writer</small>\n\n'''Voodooland'''\nAdvanced Ep (2003)\n*''Give Me Air'' (2004)\n\n'''Liberty N' Justice'''\n*''Doubting Thomas'' (2007)\n\n'''[[RATT]]'''\n*''[[Infestation (album)|Infestation]]'' (2010) <small>writer</small>\n\n'''John Corabi'''\n*''John Corabi Unplugged'' (November 2012)\n\n'''[[The Dead Daisies]]'''\n*''[[Revolucion (The Dead Daisies album)|Revoluci\u00f3n]]'' (2015)\n*''[[Make Some Noise (The Dead Daisies album)|Make Some Noise]]'' (2016)\n*''[[Burn It Down (The Dead Daisies album)]]'' (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added above External links/Sources by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.johncorabimusic.com/home.cfm/ John Corabi's official website]\n*[http://www.ratpakrecordsamerica.com/johncorabi/ John Corabi Official Merchandise]\n\n*[https://www.facebook.com/JohnCorabiMusic/ John Corabi Official Facebook Page]\n\n{{The Dead Daisies}}\n{{Ratt}}\n{{M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce}}\n{{Union (band)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corabi, John}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American rock singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce members]]\n[[Category:Ratt members]]\n[[Category:Eric Singer Project members]]\n[[Category:Union (band) members]]\n[[Category:The Scream (band) members]]\n[[Category:Singers from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:Brides of Destruction members]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Heavy metal singer and guitarist}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{POV|date=March 2013}}\n{{original research|date=March 2013}}\n{{BLP sources|date=March 2013}}\n}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n|name = John Corabi\n|background = solo_singer\n|image = The Dead Daisies - Hamburg Harley Days 2017 18.jpg\n|caption = John Corabi in 2017\n|birth_name = \n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1959|4|26}}\n| birth_place   = [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], U.S.\n|origin = \n|genre = [[Hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam metal]]\n| occupation = Musician, songwriter, singer\n|instrument = Vocals, guitar, bass\n|years_active = 1988\u2013present\n|label = [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]\n|associated_acts = [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[The Scream (band)|The Scream]], [[Ratt]], [[Brides of Destruction]], [[Angora (band)|Angora]], [[Eric Singer Project|ESP]], [[Union (band)|Union]], Angel City Outlaws, Twenty 4 Seven, Cardboard Vampyres, [[The Dead Daisies]]\n| website = {{URL|johncorabi.com/}}\n\n|\n}}\n'''John Corabi''' (born April 26, 1959) is an American hard rock singer and guitarist.

{"title_page": "Anti-sweatshop movement", "text_new": "'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite?

On Twitter, 31.82% of the tweets with #WhoMadeMyClothes were posted by users from the United Kingdom.

To promote the hashtag in 2015, Fashion Revolution released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\u201d|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views. Their 2018 campaign film uploaded on April 22nd, 2018 was awarded the Best Green Fashion Film award at the Fashion Film Festival Milano and has over 54,000 views to date.<ref>{{Citation|title=Who Made My Clothes?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnFfa0qHIM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes as the channel for the movement, Fashion Revolution has increased general public awareness of the improper work conditions faced by garment workers in Bangladesh, India, and other developing countries with cheap labor. This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations ==\n* [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] - international alliance of labor unions and non-governmental organizations\n* [[Coalition qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contre les ateliers de mis\u00e8re]] - a Qu\u00e9bec anti-sweatshop coalition based in Montr\u00e9al\n* [[Free the Children]] - a Canadian organization that helps raise awareness and put a stop to Child Labour \u2013 Also helps other children in need\n* [[Global Exchange]] - an international human rights organization founded in 1988 dedicated to promoting social, economic and environmental justice\n* [[Green America]] - membership organization based in the United States\n* [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] - founded to combat sweatshop labor and US government policy in El Salvador and Central America\n* [[International Labor Rights Forum]]\n* [[International Labour Organization]] - a specialized agency of the United Nations\n* [[Maquila Solidarity Network]] - a Canadian anti-sweatshop network\n* [[Rugmark]] - a carpet labeling program and rehabilitation centers for former child laborers in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n* [[SweatFree Communities]] - a nationwide network for local action against sweatshops\n* SweatsHope - an Australian/New Zealand organization to create a sweatshop free world and stop human trafficking\n* [[UNITE HERE]] - a labor union based in the United States and Canada dedicated to achieving higher standards for laborers \n* [[United Students Against Sweatshops]] - a student organization in the United States and Canada\n* [[Worker Rights Consortium]] - a labor rights organization focused on protecting the rights of workers who make apparel in the United States\n\n=== In Asia ===\n* [[Asia Monitor Resource Center]] - focuses on promoting democratic labor movements in Asia and the Pacific\n* [[China Labour Bulletin]] - reports on labor concerns in China\n* [[Chinese Working Women Network]] - supports and empowers Chinese migrant working women\n* [[Globalization Monitor]] - non-profit based in Hong Kong that promotes awareness on negative effects of globalization\n* [[Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee]] - empowers workers, acts as a policy watch-dog, and promotes independent trade union movements\n* [[No Sweat Shop Label and Homeworkers Code of Practice]] - corporate code of conduct to eliminate sweatshop conditions in Australia\n* [[Thai Labour Campaign]] - covers labor disputes, worker rights campaigns and labor law in Thailand\n* [[Transnationals Information Exchange]] - information on garment worker struggles in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n==Prominent campaigners==\n* [[Lady Astor]]\n* [[Alfred Deakin]]\n* [[Alfred George Gardiner]]\n* [[Vida Goldstein]]\n* [[Florence Kelley]]\n* [[Charles Kernaghan]]\n* [[Mary Reid Macarthur]]\n* [[Samuel Mauger]]\n* [[R.

To promote the hashtag in 2015, Fashion Revolution released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\u201d|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views. Their 2018 campaign film uploaded on April 22nd, 2018 was awarded the Best Green Fashion Film award at the Fashion Film Festival Milano and has over 54,000 views to date.<ref>{{Citation|title=Who Made My Clothes?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnFfa0qHIM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes as the channel for the movement, Fashion Revolution has increased general public awareness of the improper work conditions faced by garment workers in Bangladesh, India, and other developing countries with cheap labor. This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations ==\n* [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] - international alliance of labor unions and non-governmental organizations\n* [[Coalition qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contre les ateliers de mis\u00e8re]] - a Qu\u00e9bec anti-sweatshop coalition based in Montr\u00e9al\n* [[Free the Children]] - a Canadian organization that helps raise awareness and put a stop to Child Labour \u2013 Also helps other children in need\n* [[Global Exchange]] - an international human rights organization founded in 1988 dedicated to promoting social, economic and environmental justice\n* [[Green America]] - membership organization based in the United States\n* [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] - founded to combat sweatshop labor and US government policy in El Salvador and Central America\n* [[International Labor Rights Forum]]\n* [[International Labour Organization]] - a specialized agency of the United Nations\n* [[Maquila Solidarity Network]] - a Canadian anti-sweatshop network\n* [[Rugmark]] - a carpet labeling program and rehabilitation centers for former child laborers in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n* [[SweatFree Communities]] - a nationwide network for local action against sweatshops\n* SweatsHope - an Australian/New Zealand organization to create a sweatshop free world and stop human trafficking\n* [[UNITE HERE]] - a labor union based in the United States and Canada dedicated to achieving higher standards for laborers \n* [[United Students Against Sweatshops]] - a student organization in the United States and Canada\n* [[Worker Rights Consortium]] - a labor rights organization focused on protecting the rights of workers who make apparel in the United States\n\n=== In Asia ===\n* [[Asia Monitor Resource Center]] - focuses on promoting democratic labor movements in Asia and the Pacific\n* [[China Labour Bulletin]] - reports on labor concerns in China\n* [[Chinese Working Women Network]] - supports and empowers Chinese migrant working women\n* [[Globalization Monitor]] - non-profit based in Hong Kong that promotes awareness on negative effects of globalization\n* [[Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee]] - empowers workers, acts as a policy watch-dog, and promotes independent trade union movements\n* [[No Sweat Shop Label and Homeworkers Code of Practice]] - corporate code of conduct to eliminate sweatshop conditions in Australia\n* [[Thai Labour Campaign]] - covers labor disputes, worker rights campaigns and labor law in Thailand\n* [[Transnationals Information Exchange]] - information on garment worker struggles in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n==Prominent campaigners==\n* [[Lady Astor]]\n* [[Alfred Deakin]]\n* [[Alfred George Gardiner]]\n* [[Vida Goldstein]]\n* [[Florence Kelley]]\n* [[Charles Kernaghan]]\n* [[Mary Reid Macarthur]]\n* [[Samuel Mauger]]\n* [[R.

There are four International airports (Shanghai Pudong, Shanghai Hongqiao, Nanjing Lukou, Yancheng Nanyang) within 200 kilometers. There are also several other domestic airports nearby. The [[Xinchang Railway]] traverses the downtown. [[China National Highway 204]], No. 333 provincial highway, Anqiang provincial road, and [[G15 Shenyang\u2013Haikou Expressway]], alternatively known in the province as the Coastal Expressway ({{zh|c=\u6cbf\u6d77\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def|labels=no}}).\n\n== Culture ==\nThe dialect in Dongtai is quite different from [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. The local accent is closely related to nearby Taizhou, Haiyan, Xinghua, Dafeng area.\n\nThe cuisine in Dongtai is closely related to Huai-Yang. The taste is not strong, and that is different from most of other regions in China. In Dongtai, people also have chance to eat different seafood.\n\nTourist can also find fun in Dongtai. Xi-xi ancient town is the cradle of Dongtai and it is also a Holy land of Buddhism. The Yellow Sea (Huanghai) National Park is on the east coastal region of Dongtai and there are also a national everglade protection region and a five-A (the highest level) precious animal protection region nearby\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jiangsu.net/city/city.php?name=dongtai Dongtai City English guide] (Jiangsu.NET)\n\n{{County-level divisions of Jiangsu}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Yancheng]]\n[[Category:County-level divisions of Jiangsu]]\n", "name_user": "CaradhrasAiguo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClimate:fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongtai"}

Within [[Morpheme|morphemes]], the stress is typically placed on the second-to-last vowel. When suffixes are attached to bases, the stress shifts to the second-to-last vowel according to this rule. <ref name=\":0\" /> One exception is when a verb is in the form CVV and a monosyllabic pronoun is attached to it as a suffix, in which case the stress does not move. For example, the verb ''fai'' 'scratch' is stressed on the [a], but in the suffixed form ''fai-a'' 'scratch it' the stress remains with the first [a] and does not move to the [i].\n\n=== Reduplication ===\nIn Kwaio, full and partial [[reduplication]] commonly occurs. It happens when showing the passage of time; to emphasize the meaning of an adjective (''siisika'' 'very small'); to show continuous, prolonged, or repeated action in verbs (''bonobono'' 'completely closed'); or to indicate plurality in nouns (''rua niinimana'' 'two arms'). <ref>{{Cite book|title=Kwaio: A Grammatical Introduction.|last=Keesing|first=Roger M.|publisher=Australian National University.|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Glottal stop deletion ===\nThe [[Glottal stop|glottal stop]] is often omitted in the Kwaio language when there are successive syllables that use the glottal stop. This happens across the word boundary if one word ends in -V'V and the next starts 'V-, which will then be pronounced as VV'V (instead of V'V'V), i.e. one of the glottal stops is dropped. An example of this is ''te'e + 'ola'' \u2192 ''tee'ola''. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Morphology ==\nSimilar to other Melanesian languages, Kwaio uses two [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological classes]]: bases and particles. <ref name=\":1\" /> More complex forms can be made by modifying bases by adding affixes (prefixes, suffixes, or infixes) or by conjoining bases. Particles attach to bases and show the relationship between phrases and clauses. The bases follow the syllable pattern CVCV, CVV or VCV.\n\n=== Possessive Nouns ===\nSimilar to other languages on Malaita, the Kwaio language does not show possession of food and drinks, but it adds the possessive particle ''a-'', e.g. ''<nowiki/>'ifi a-gu'' 'my house'. To show alienable possession, Kwaio uses ''fue nua'' which translates to 'my namesake'. Nouns are not strictly [[Alienable and inalienable possession|alienable or inalienable]], instead the possession forms a semantic relationship between nouns. Possession must be looked at with a wider scope to establish where the possession belongs as nouns may be possessed differently using markers. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Individual and Mass Nouns ===\nIf an inanimate noun is countable, it can be quantified by either a number or ''ni'', which is a plural article. For example, in ''ni 'ai'' 'trees' the noun ''<nowiki/>'ai'' 'tree' is marked by the plural article. ''ni'' or numerals cannot be used when a noun is uncountable or a mass object. <ref name=\":0\" /> For example, ''one'' 'sand' refers to a mass substance, so *''ni one'' is ungrammatical. Yet, certain mass nouns can be quantified with an additional measure word, e.g. in ''oru foo'i one'' 'three grains of sand' the measure word ''foo'i'' 'grains' is used to quantify ''one'' 'sand'. <br />\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nThere are 15 [[Personal pronoun|personal pronouns]] in Kwaio, covering four number categories (singular, dual, trial, and plural) and four persons (first inclusive, first exclusive, second and third). The language also distinguishes focal and referencing pronoun.<ref name=\":0\" /> The pronouns are shown in the table below.

Active verbs can be broken up into two more categories, namely transitive and intransitive verbs. The verbs can generally be distinguished by the relationship with [[Noun phrase|noun phrases]] that are in the sentence or clause. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Syntax ==\nSentences in Kwaio either have verbal predicates or do not. If a sentence has a verbal predicate, a comprising declarative, or is an interrogative sentence, it follows an [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] word order. Phrases in Kwaio include noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, and temporal phrases. Sentences that do not have a verbal predicate include sentences that are [[Nominal sentence|equational]] and [[Locative case|locative]]. Types of sentences include declarative verbal sentences, stative verbal sentences, and verbless declarative sentences. Questions have no special morphological marking but are indicated with [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation contours]]. <ref name=\":0\" /> The passage of time can be represented with reduplication and repetition, as in ''eeleka leeleka leeleka ma la age no'o i mae-na'' 'He ran away into the forest and [after a long while] they gave the feast for his death', where the verb ''leka'' 'go' is reduplicated and repeated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Languages of the Solomon Islands}}\n\n[[Category:Malaita languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Solomon Islands]]\n[[Category:Kwaio]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox language\n|name=Kwaio\n|nativename=\n|states=[[Solomon Islands]]\n|region=[[Malaita Island]]\n|ethnicity=[[Kwaio people]]\n|speakers={{sigfig|13,200|2}}\n|date=1999\n|ref=e18\n|familycolor=Austronesian\n|fam2=[[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]]\n|fam3=[[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]]\n|fam4=[[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic]]\n|fam5=[[Malaita \u2013 San Cristobal languages|Malaita \u2013 San Cristobal]]\n|fam6=[[Malaita languages|Malaita]]\n|fam7=[[Northern Malaita languages|Northern Malaita]]\n|iso3=kwd\n|glotto=kwai1243\n|glottorefname=Kwaio\n}}\n\nThe '''Kwaio language''', or '''Koio''', is spoken in the centre of [[Malaita Island]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].
