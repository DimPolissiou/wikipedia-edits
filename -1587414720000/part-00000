{"title_page": "John Paul Blass", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=March 2013}}\n\n'''John P. Blass''' is a physician, biochemist and neurochemist who was born on February 21, 1937 to Gustaf Blass and Jolan Wirth Blass in Vienna, [[Austria]]. Both his parents were physicians; his father was a prominent Viennese [[radiologist]] and his mother, a student of Sigmund Freud, was a psychoanalyst originally from [[Budapest]]. The family then moved to Stamford, [[Connecticut]]. Both parents practiced psychiatry, Gustaf in a private sanitarium in Stamford and Jolan as a child psychiatrist in New York City and Connecticut.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nBlass' most prominent professional achievements are in the area of aging and [[Alzheimer's disease]], in particular relating to brain metabolism. He holds patents based on decades of scientific research, including a neutraceutical \"metabolic enhancer\" which has been under study in a large-scale, controlled, \"multicenter\" clinical trial. Preliminary results have led to its being made available commercially. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nHe has written and contributed to a number of books including assorted volumes on Alzheimer's disease and a textbook on pharmacology.\n\n\n==Education and institutional positions==\n\nDr. Blass' studies brought him to [[Harvard]] College (summa cum laude, class of 1958, Harvard Scholar, [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (senior sixteen), Sigma Xi, Biochemical Sciences major); the [[University of London]] where as a Marshall Scholar he earned his PhD in Biochemistry (1960) under thesis professor and pioneer of modern neurochemistry Henry McIlwain; and to Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons where Blass earned his medical degree ([[Alpha Omega Alpha]], class of 1965). During this time, he took a year off to do research as an American Cancer Society fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Heinrich Waelsch, another founding father of neurochemistry. John's internship and residency was in internal medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston (1965\u201367). Then he spent three years (1967-1970) in the National Heart Institute at the [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH)(now the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). From 1970-1978 he was an Assistant and Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Biochemistry at the [[UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute]]. Since then he has been Winifred Masterson Burke Professor of Neurology and Medicine at Weill Medical College of [[Cornell University]].  He established and directed the Dementia Research Service, a combined research and clinical unit at a Cornell affiliated institution, the Burke Medical Research Institute. He was also appointed in the field of Neurosciences. He served on the National Panel on Alzheimer's Disease from 1986 to 1996 and was Chairman from 1986 to 1991. As a member of the National Institute on Aging, he was Chairman of Geriatric Medicine Ad Hoc Review Committees from 1981 to1984 and Chairman of the Consensus Panel on Neurochemistry of Alzheimer's Disease in 1982. He served on the President's Department of Health and Human Services Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease  in 1982-1984. He was President of the American Federation for Aging Research in 1994-1996. In 2005, he became Emeritus Professor at Cornell, and fully retired as of 2007. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn September 2007, the New York Academy of Sciences held a conference in honor of Dr. Blass, 'Mitochondria and Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disorders', which was also a satellite meeting of the International Society of Neurochemistry.<ref>http://www.nyas.org/Events/Detail.aspx?cid=8a0f4c49-b1c2-46d1-bc05-68984e789335 http://www.nyas.org/Publications/EBriefings/Detail.aspx?cid=43761f39-1397-4cfb-b1ef-43f864ac5fbb</ref>\n\nAlso in 2007 the scientific journal Neurochemical Research published a special issue (Volume 32, Numbers 4-5, 775-781, {{doi|10.1007/s11064-006-9207-7}}) dedicated to Dr. Blass.<ref>{{cite journal|title=[Keywords: Homocysteine - Plasma - Amyloid beta - Alzheimer's disease |doi=10.1007/s11064-006-9207-7 |pmid=17191133 |volume=32 |issue=4\u20135 |journal=Neurochemical Research |pages=775\u2013781|year=2007 |last1=Luchsinger |first1=J.

My laboratory was particularly interested in diseases affecting the brain's ability to burn its major fuel, sugar. These diseases affect the power plants of the cell (mitochondria) and specifically a part of the mitochondria, namely the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle. My coworkers and I were among the first researchers to study the abnormalities in mitochondria in the Alzheimer brain. Our discoveries led me to develop a patented nutraceutical preparation that appeared to slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease, in a small but rigorous study. As emeritus professor, my current focus is further development and clinical testing of this and related preparations designed to help people with Alzheimer disease and other diseases that cause degeneration of the brain.\"\n\nDr. Blass's research has concentrated on brain metabolism and metabolic diseases of the brain, particularly diseases affecting the mitochondria and specifically the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle. Blass's interest in this topic began at NIH, where he described the first hereditary defect in a major enzyme of human oxidative/energy metabolism, [[pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency]]. Since moving to Cornell, his work concentrated on Alzheimer Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. He and his coworkers pioneered the finding that inherent abnormalities of mitochondrial components occur in Alzheimer brain and other Alzheimer tissues and the implications of that finding for the pathophysiology of the dementia. He has also published on clinical aspects of Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment.\n\nIn recent years Dr. Blass developed a [[nutraceutical]] \"metabolic enhancer\" which appeared to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in a relatively small placebo-controlled clinical trials and is under study in a larger multicenter trial. Cornell devolved the patent for this invention on him and related formulations, including a skin cream, are now being developed commercially. Dr. Blass's current research interests include the refinement and clinical testing of these preparations.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\nConversations with Dr. Blass\n\nCV including List of Publications: http://www.johnblass.org/JohnPBlass_CV.pdf\n\nBurke Medical Research Institute (http://www.burke.org/)\n\nWeill Medical College of Cornell University (http://www.med.cornell.edu/)\n\nNew York Academy of Sciences conference in honor of Dr. Blass, 'Mitochondria and Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disorders'\nhttp://www.nyas.org/Events/Detail.aspx?cid=8a0f4c49-b1c2-46d1-bc05-68984e789335\n\nNeurochemical Research special issue dedicated to Dr. Blass\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11064-006-9207-7\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.bookfinder.com/author/john-p-blass/\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20060926052054/http://www.burke.org/research/staff/blass.htm\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blass, John Paul}}\n[[Category:Austrian biochemists]]\n[[Category:Austrian neurologists]]\n[[Category:Cornell University faculty]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Neurochemists]]\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:Marshall Scholars]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of London]]\n[[Category:Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=March 2013}}\n\n'''John P. Blass''' is a physician, biochemist and neurochemist who was born on February 21, 1937 to Gustaf Blass and Jolan Wirth Blass in Vienna, [[Austria]]. Both his parents were physicians; his father was a prominent Viennese [[radiologist]] and his mother, a student of Sigmund Freud, was a psychoanalyst originally from [[Budapest]]. The family then moved to Stamford, [[Connecticut]]. Both parents practiced psychiatry, Gustaf in a private sanitarium in Stamford and Jolan as a child psychiatrist in New York City and Connecticut.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nBlass' most prominent professional achievements are in the area of aging and [[Alzheimer's disease]], in particular relating to brain metabolism. He holds patents based on decades of scientific research, including a neutraceutical \"metabolic enhancer\" which has been under study in a large-scale, controlled, \"multicenter\" clinical trial. Preliminary results have led to its being made available commercially. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nHe has written and contributed to a number of books including assorted volumes on Alzheimer's disease and a textbook on pharmacology.\n\n\n==Education and institutional positions==\n\nDr. Blass' studies brought him to [[Harvard]] College (summa cum laude, class of 1958, Harvard Scholar, [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (senior sixteen), Sigma Xi, Biochemical Sciences major); the [[University of London]] where as a Marshall Scholar he earned his PhD in Biochemistry (1960) under thesis professor and pioneer of modern neurochemistry Henry McIlwain; and to Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons where Blass earned his medical degree ([[Alpha Omega Alpha]], class of 1965). During this time, he took a year off to do research as an American Cancer Society fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Heinrich Waelsch, another founding father of neurochemistry. John's internship and residency was in internal medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston (1965\u201367). Then he spent three years (1967-1970) in the National Heart Institute at the [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH)(now the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). From 1970-1978 he was an Assistant and Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Biochemistry at the [[UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute]]. Since then he has been Winifred Masterson Burke Professor of Neurology and Medicine at Weill Medical College of [[Cornell University]].  He established and directed the Dementia Research Service, a combined research and clinical unit at a Cornell affiliated institution, the Burke Medical Research Institute. He was also appointed in the field of Neurosciences. He served on the National Panel on Alzheimer's Disease from 1986 to 1996 and was Chariman from 1986 to 1991. As a member of the National Institute on Aging, he was Charimn of Geriatric Medicine Ad Hoc Review Committees from 1981 to1984 and Chariman of the Consensus Panel on Neurochemistry of Alzheimer's Disease in 1982. He served on the President's Department of Health and Human Services Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease  in 1982-1984. He was President of the American Federation for Aging Research in 1994-1996. In 2005, he became Emeritus Professor at Cornell, and fully retired as of 2007. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn September 2007, the New York Academy of Sciences held a conference in honor of Dr. Blass, 'Mitochondria and Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disorders', which was also a satellite meeting of the International Society of Neurochemistry.<ref>http://www.nyas.org/Events/Detail.aspx?cid=8a0f4c49-b1c2-46d1-bc05-68984e789335 http://www.nyas.org/Publications/EBriefings/Detail.aspx?cid=43761f39-1397-4cfb-b1ef-43f864ac5fbb</ref>\n\nAlso in 2007 the scientific journal Neurochemical Research published a special issue (Volume 32, Numbers 4-5, 775-781, {{doi|10.1007/s11064-006-9207-7}}) dedicated to Dr. Blass.<ref>{{cite journal|title=[Keywords: Homocysteine - Plasma - Amyloid beta - Alzheimer's disease |doi=10.1007/s11064-006-9207-7 |pmid=17191133 |volume=32 |issue=4\u20135 |journal=Neurochemical Research |pages=775\u2013781|year=2007 |last1=Luchsinger |first1=J.

A sultry-voiced female named Charlie (voiced by [[Susan Davis (actor)|Susan Davis]]) contacts the bears on the truck's [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] to give them their assignments. This show was \"inspired\" by the hit TV series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (Bump wore a blonde hairstyle similar to [[Farrah Fawcett]]). Each of the bears' names are based on a 1970s [[disco]] dance, and the show's overall premise made reference to the CB radio craze of the mid-1970s (by this point waning in popularity). Physically and personality-wise, Hustle, Boogie, and Bump resemble Hair Bear, Bubi Bear, and Square Bear, respectively, from ''[[Help!...

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u20131995), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u20131998), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u20132003) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005\u20132007).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=27 December 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|title=The Year of the Rolling Stones|newspaper=New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701174542/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|archivedate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\" list and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated record sales]] is 200&nbsp;million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary. They still continue to release albums to brisk sales and critical acclaim; their most recent album ''[[Blue & Lonesome (Rolling Stones album)|Blue & Lonesome]]'' was released in December 2016 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US and won a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]].

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972). It was during this period they were first introduced on stage as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|\"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\"]].<ref name=\"Greatest Rock Band\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rolling-stones/9694545/Rolling-Stones-are-they-really-the-worlds-greatest-rock-n-roll-band.html|title=Rolling Stones: are they really the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band?|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711075332/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rolling-stones/9694545/Rolling-Stones-are-they-really-the-worlds-greatest-rock-n-roll-band.html|archivedate=11 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/stones-may-be-old-they-can-still-rock-wbna8985740|title=The Stones may be old, but they can still rock|work=Msnbc|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe band continued to release commercially successful albums through the 1970s and early 1980s, including ''[[Some Girls]]'' (1978) and ''[[Tattoo You]]'' (1981), the two best-sellers in their discography. During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u20131995), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u20131998), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u20132003) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005\u20132007).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=27 December 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|title=The Year of the Rolling Stones|newspaper=New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701174542/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|archivedate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\" list and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated record sales]] is 200&nbsp;million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary. They still continue to release albums to brisk sales and critical acclaim; their most recent album ''[[Blue & Lonesome (Rolling Stones album)|Blue & Lonesome]]'' was released in December 2016 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US and won a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]]. The group also continues to sell out venues, with their recent [[No Filter Tour]] running for two years and concluding in August 2019.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\n[[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]] became childhood friends and classmates in 1950 in [[Dartford]], [[Kent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstones.com/artist/mick-jagger/|title=Mick Jagger {{!}} The Rolling Stones|website=www.rollingstones.com|language=en|access-date=2 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903121800/http://www.rollingstones.com/artist/mick-jagger/|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>White, Charles.

It lies north of Poole town centre and borders the neighbouring suburbs of Waterloo, Creekmoor, [[Oakdale, Dorset|Oakdale]] and [[Canford Heath]].  The use of land varies between residential, retail and some light industry.  The area is also home to Parkstone Grammar School when it moved there from [[Lower Parkstone]] in 1962.  The site of the Tesco at Fleets Corner was, up until the 1980s, the home of Hamworthy Recreation Football Club before the land was sold and the club moved to Canford Magna on the northern extreme of the Borough of Poole.  Opposite to Tesco, across Waterloo Road, is the home of the headquarters of the global company, Hamworthy Combustion Engineering.  Fleets Industrial Estate lies to the south of the gyratory off Fleets Lane and is adjacent to Wessex Gate Retail Park, which has large retail outlets such as [[Dfs (retailer)|DFS]], [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]]. The bridge the area is named after was built by Rachel's Dad.\n\n==Fleetsbridge Roundabout==\n[[File:Fleet's Corner Flyover - geograph.org.uk - 1550097.jpg|thumb|right|Fleet's Corner flyover and roundabout]]\n===The roundabout===\nThe flyover itself forms part of Dorset Way which is a stretch of the A3049 that runs west to east from Poole to [[Boscombe]] in [[Bournemouth]]. Underneath one section of the bridge is a busy gyratory that has six routes leading on and off it. Waterloo Road is part of the A349 that goes to [[Wimborne Minster]], and this is also access to the [[Tesco]] and the northern suburbs of Poole. There is a slip-road for traffic travelling onto the A3049 and parallel to this is the slip-road for traffic exiting the A3049. Wimborne Road is part of the A35 which is part of the main route into Poole from Fleetsbridge. Fleets Lane is a quieter road that allows access to Wessex Gate and Fleets Industrial Estate and eventually leads to [[Sterte]] and Poole town centre. The other road is Upton Road that is also part of the A35 and takes traffic west-bound out of Poole, as well as suburbs such as Creekmoor and [[Broadstone, Dorset|Broadstone]].\n\n===Roads converging into Fleetsbridge Roundabout===\n*Waterloo Road (A349)\n*Wimborne Road ([[A35 road|A35]])\n*Upton Road (A35)\n*Fleets Lane\n*Slip road to and from Dorset Way (A3049)\n\n===Broadstone Way===\n[[File:Broadstone Way at Fleetsbridge - geograph.org.uk - 1326855.jpg|thumb|right|Broadstone Way]]\nA smaller section of the bridge on the western side crosses over Broadstone Way, which is separated from the roundabout. This road also forms part of the A349. Upton Road also travels via bridge over Broadstone Way. Broadstone Way was originally the route of the railway line that ran from Poole to Broadstone and beyond. It was closed in the 1960s in line with the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching]] cuts to Britain's railways.\n\n===Buildings adjacent to the roundabout===\n* [[Tesco]] Extra\n* Hamworthy Engineering\n* Toby's Carvery\n* [[Office Outlet]] and Wren Kitchens\n\nAlthough the Tesco itself is called Fleets Corner and the pub's address is Fleets Corner, they are both referred to locally as being \"Fleetsbridge\", for example \"''Tom Whitehead goes shopping at Fleetsbridge Tesco''\".\n\n{{coord|50.739|-1.987|type:city_region:GB-POL|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Areas of Poole]]\n[[Category:Transport in Dorset]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2016}}\n'''Fleetsbridge''' is a small area of [[Poole]], [[Dorset]], centred on a busy gyratory and flyover.

Fleets Industrial Estate lies to the south of the gyratory off Fleets Lane and is adjacent to Wessex Gate Retail Park, which has large retail outlets such as [[Dfs (retailer)|DFS]], [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]].\n\n==Fleetsbridge Roundabout==\n[[File:Fleet's Corner Flyover - geograph.org.uk - 1550097.jpg|thumb|right|Fleet's Corner flyover and roundabout]]\n===The roundabout===\nThe flyover itself forms part of Dorset Way which is a stretch of the A3049 that runs west to east from Poole to [[Boscombe]] in [[Bournemouth]]. Underneath one section of the bridge is a busy gyratory that has six routes leading on and off it. Waterloo Road is part of the A349 that goes to [[Wimborne Minster]], and this is also access to the [[Tesco]] and the northern suburbs of Poole. There is a slip-road for traffic travelling onto the A3049 and parallel to this is the slip-road for traffic exiting the A3049. Wimborne Road is part of the A35 which is part of the main route into Poole from Fleetsbridge. Fleets Lane is a quieter road that allows access to Wessex Gate and Fleets Industrial Estate and eventually leads to [[Sterte]] and Poole town centre. The other road is Upton Road that is also part of the A35 and takes traffic west-bound out of Poole, as well as suburbs such as Creekmoor and [[Broadstone, Dorset|Broadstone]].\n\n===Roads converging into Fleetsbridge Roundabout===\n*Waterloo Road (A349)\n*Wimborne Road ([[A35 road|A35]])\n*Upton Road (A35)\n*Fleets Lane\n*Slip road to and from Dorset Way (A3049)\n\n===Broadstone Way===\n[[File:Broadstone Way at Fleetsbridge - geograph.org.uk - 1326855.jpg|thumb|right|Broadstone Way]]\nA smaller section of the bridge on the western side crosses over Broadstone Way, which is separated from the roundabout. This road also forms part of the A349. Upton Road also travels via bridge over Broadstone Way. Broadstone Way was originally the route of the railway line that ran from Poole to Broadstone and beyond. It was closed in the 1960s in line with the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching]] cuts to Britain's railways.\n\n===Buildings adjacent to the roundabout===\n* [[Tesco]] Extra\n* Hamworthy Engineering\n* Toby's Carvery\n* [[Office Outlet]] and Wren Kitchens\n\nAlthough the Tesco itself is called Fleets Corner and the pub's address is Fleets Corner, they are both referred to locally as being \"Fleetsbridge\", for example \"''Tom Whitehead goes shopping at Fleetsbridge Tesco''\".\n\n{{coord|50.739|-1.987|type:city_region:GB-POL|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Areas of Poole]]\n[[Category:Transport in Dorset]]\n", "name_user": "SamSerrano123", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetsbridge"}
