An inventory of the church's possessions taken at the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]] includes vestments for children, suggesting that the church maintained the tradition of electing a [[boy bishop]] on [[Saint Nicholas Day]]. Deeds in the reign of Richard I refer to a new fish market near St Nicholas Cole Abbey. In a Charter of 1272, the church is referred to as \"St Nick's behind Fish Street\".  During the 16th century, several fishmongers were buried here and [[John Stow]] records that, during the reign of Elizabeth I, a lead and stone cistern, fed by the Thames, was set up against the north wall \"for the care and commodity of the Fishmongers in and about Old Fish Street\".\n\nLike all English churches, St Nicholas Cole Abbey became Protestant during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. Upon the accession of Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], it was the first church to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (on 23 August 1553). The incumbent rector, Thomas Sowdley, had obtained a licence to marry during the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and was deprived of his living as a result. In the same month as the coronation of Mary I, [[John Strype]] recorded \"Another priest called sir Tho. Snowdel, [i.e. Sowdley] whom they nicknamed 'Parson Chicken', was carted through Cheapside, for assoiling an old acquaintance of his in a ditch in Finsbury field; and was at that riding saluted with chamber-pots and rotten eggs\". Sowdley regained his living on the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\nA century later, the living of St Nicholas Cole Abbey was owned by Colonel [[Francis Hacker]], a [[Puritan]] who commanded the execution detail of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].\n\nThe church was destroyed in the Great Fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=The City Churches |last=Tabor |first=M. |location=London |publisher=Swarthmore Press |year=1917 |page=99 }}</ref> [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] promised the site to the [[Lutheran]] community but lobbying prevented this from being granted and the parish was combined with that of [[St Nicholas Olave]], a nearby church also destroyed but not rebuilt.

Included in the building accounts are the items \"Dinner for Dr Wren and other Company \u2013 \u00a32 14s 0d\" and \"Half a pint of canary for Dr Wren's coachmen \u2013 6d\". It was the first church of the fifty-one lost in the Great Fire to be rebuilt.\n\nIn 1737, the early [[Methodist]] leader [[George Whitefield]] preached a sermon on \"Profane swearing in church\" at St Nicholas Cole Abbey.\n\nThe post-Fire church was built with its fa\u00e7ade to the north on what was then Fish Street (and what is now Distaff Lane) and the east on Old Fish Street Hill. [[Victorian period|Victorian]] urban redevelopment changed the local street plan and the south wall of the church, instead of being hemmed in by buildings now overlooked the newly-built [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]]. This necessitated a reordering of the church, in 1874, with windows being opened up to the south and the main doorway moving from the northwest tower to the south.\n\nSmoke generated by underground trains so blackened the exterior that in the late 19th century, the church became known as \"St Nicholas Cole Hole Abbey\".\n\nIn May 1881, [[church attendance]] under the Reverend [[Henry Stebbing (editor)|Henry Stebbing]] was down to one man and one woman. Then, in 1883, Henry Shuttleworth was appointed rector, a position he held until 1900. Shuttleworth was a Christian Socialist who installed a bar, established a prodigious musical programme and made the church a centre for debate. This had an effect, as by 1891 St Nicholas Cole Abbey had the largest congregation of any City church, numbering up to 450 worshippers on a Sunday evening. A contemporary vicar commented: \"In St. Nicholas Cole Abbey there is good preaching and divine worship is also carried out in the most reverential manner.

In his third year Rayner specialised in Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac and Semitic [[Epigraphy]].  In his sixth year Rayner began working as a research student on a thesis about [[Maimonides]]' conception of Revelation.\n\nRayner was ordained in the Liberal Jewish ministry on 21 June 1953 and served the [[South London Liberal Synagogue]], in [[Streatham]] until 1957.

This means that objects with higher stiffness are more difficult to bend or deform than objects with lower stiffnesses. This concept can be extended to the limbs and joints of biological organisms in which stiffness describes the degree to which a limb or joint deflects (or bends) under a given load.

In this way, the stiffness of a limb is partially dictated by the limb's posture. This component of limb stiffness is due to the mechanics of the limb and is controlled voluntarily.\n\n=== Voluntary vs. involuntary stiffness modulation ===\n\nSome components of limb stiffness are under voluntary control while others are involuntary.<ref name=Trumbower /> The determining factor as to whether a component of stiffness is controlled voluntarily or involuntarily is the timescale of that particular component's method of action. For example, stiffness corrections that happen very quickly (80-100 milliseconds) are involuntary while slower stiffness corrections and adjustments are under voluntary control. Many of the voluntary stiffness adjustments are controlled by the [[motor cortex]] while involuntary adjustments can be controlled by [[reflex]] loops in the [[spinal cord]] or other parts of the brain.<ref name=Ludvig /><ref name=Nichols /><ref name=\"purves book\">{{cite book|editor=Dale Purves|title=Neuroscience.|year=2007|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0878936977|edition=4th |display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nStiffness adjustments due to reflexes are involuntary and are controlled by the spinal cord while posture selection is controlled voluntarily.<ref name=Trumbower /> However, not each component of stiffness is strictly voluntary or involuntary.<ref name=Ludvig /> For example, Antagonistic muscle cocontraction can be either voluntary or involuntary. Additionally, because much of the legs' movements are controlled by the spinal cord and because of the larger neural delay associated with sending signals to the leg muscles, leg stiffness is more involuntarily controlled than arm stiffness.\n\n=== Possible neural control models ===\n\nResearchers have begun implementing controllers in into robots to control for stiffness. One such model adjusts for stiffness during robotic locomotion by virtually cocontracting antagonistic muscles about the robot's joints to modulate stiffness while a [[central pattern generator]] (CPG) controls the robot's locomotion.<ref name= Xiong>{{cite journal|last=Xiong|first=Xiaofeng|author2=Worgotter, F. |author3=Manoonpong, P. |title=An adaptive neuromechanical model for muscle impedance modulations of legged robots}}</ref>\n\nOther models of the neural modulation of stiffness include a [[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]] model of stiffness adjustment. These models of neural control support the idea that humans use a feedforward mechanism of stiffness selection in anticipation of the required stiffness needed to accomplish a given task.<ref name= Hu>{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Xiao|author2=Murray, W.M. |author3=Perreault, E.J. |title=Biomechanical constraints on the feedforward regulation of endpoint stiffness|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|year=2012|volume=108|issue=8|pages=2083\u20132091|pmid=22832565|pmc=3545028|doi=10.1152/jn.00330.2012}}</ref>\n\nMost models of the neural control of stiffness promote the idea that humans choose an optimal limb stiffness based on their environment or the task at hand. Studies postulate the humans do this in order to stabilize unstable [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of the environment and also to maximize the energy efficiency of a given movement.<ref name=Trumbower /><ref name=Burdet /> The exact method by which humans accomplish this is unknown, but impedance control has been used to give insight into how humans may choose an appropriate stiffness in different environments and as they perform different tasks.<ref name=Hogan /> Impedance control has served as the basis for much of the work done in the area of determining how humans interact with their environment. The work of Neville Hogan has been particularly useful in this area as much of the work being done today in this area is based on his previous work.<ref name=Hogan />\n\n== Applications in robotics ==\n\n=== Neuroprosthetics and exoskeletons ===\n[[File:2005-11-14 ShadowLeg Finished medium.jpg|thumb|A robotic leg powered by [[Pneumatic artificial muscles|air muscle actuators]] ]]\n\n\tKnowledge of human stiffness variation and stiffness selection has influenced [[robot]]ic designs as researchers attempt to design robots that act more like biological systems. In order for robots to act more like biological systems, work is being done to attempt to implement stiffness modulation in robots so that they may interact more effectively with their environment.\n\n\tState of the art [[neuroprosthetics]] have attempted to implements stiffness control in their robotic devices. The goal of these devices is to replace the limbs of amputees and allow the new limbs to adjust their stiffness in order to effectively interact with the environment.<ref name= Fite>{{cite journal|last=Fite|first=Kevin|author2=Mitchell, J. |author3=Sup, F. |author4=Goldfarb, M. |title=Design and control of an electrically powered knee prosthesis|journal=Rehabilitation Robotics Conference|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n\tAdditionally, robotic [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeletons]] have attempted to implement similar adjustable stiffness in their devices.<ref name= VanDerKooij>{{cite book|last=Van Der Kooij|first=H.|author2=Veneman, J. |author3=Ekkelenkamp, R. |title=Design of a compliantly actuated exoskeleton for an impedance controlled gait trainer robot|journal=Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference of the IEEE|year=2006|pmid=17946801|doi=10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259397|volume=1|pages=189\u201393|isbn=978-1-4244-0032-4}}</ref> These robots implement stiffness control for multiple reasons.

Some devices use [[Controller (control theory)|controllers]] and rigid [[Servomechanism|servomotor]]s to simulate variable stiffness. Other devices utilize specific flexible [[actuator]]s to achieve a various levels of limb stiffness.\n\n=== Actuation Techniques ===\n\n\tThese robotic devices are able to achieve variable stiffness through various mechanisms such as simulating stiffness variation through control of stiff actuators or by utilizing variable stiffness actuators. Variable stiffness actuators mimic biological organisms by changing their inherent stiffness.<ref name=VanHam /> These variable stiffness acutators are able to control their inherent stiffness in multiple ways. Some vary their stiffness much like humans do, by varying the force contribution of antagonistic mechanical muscles. Other actuators are able to adjust their stiffness by taking advantage of the properties of [[Plasticity (physics)|deformable]] elements housed within the actuators.\n\n\tBy utilizing these variable stiffness actuation technologies, new robots have been able to more accurately replicate the motions of biological organisms and mimic their energetic efficiencies.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Powered exoskeleton]]\n*[[Neuroprosthetics]]\n*[[Robotics]]\n*[[Stiffness]]\n*[[Motor control]]\n*[[Neuroscience]]\n*[[Motor coordination]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Neurophysiology]]\n[[Category:Limbs (anatomy)]]\n", "name_user": "VeryGoodDog", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_control_of_limb_stiffness"}
