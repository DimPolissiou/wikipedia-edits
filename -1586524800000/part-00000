Berry Station was built to serve what was at the time the largest town on the alignment, and opened as part of this extension. The station, constructed by the firm of G. J. Featherstone & T. J. Barbel, included a [[passing loop]], stationmaster's cottage, platform, waiting shed and goods shed. The main platform building contained a ticket office, general waiting room, 'ladies' room' and toilet. The buildings were constructed from [[Clapboard (architecture)|weatherboard]] with [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated steel]] roofs. Though the original plans called for a second platform and waiting shed, these did not eventuate.\n\n1907 plans show the station with the following structures: on the east side of the railway tracks (south to north): Berry Central Butter Factory, engine boiler house, goods shed, and a Fettler's cottage near the level crossing; west side (south to north): cattle yards, Fettler's cottage, levers, platform with horse dock at southern end, platform building, Station Master's residence with a fern house attached to the south-western corner, and a further Fettler's cottage to the west of the level crossing.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe station precinct grew to include the Berry Central Butter Factory, cattle yards, and a number of residences for railway workers. A signal box was added in 1912. In 1912 the goods siding was extended to serve the Berry Central Butter Factory, it being also extended in 1913 to send milk to the [[Sydney]] markets.<ref name=nswshr-1084/> A brick toilet block was added in 1979. Of the former goods yard, today only a small up siding opposite the station and a small down siding to the west remain.<ref name=asa /> With most of its 1893 buildings intact as of 2009, Berry Station is considered state-significant heritage by the [[Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)|Office of Environment & Heritage]]. As the buildings pre-date the standardisation of railway buildings such as cottages, they are relatively rare examples of their type.<ref name=\"heritage\" />\n\nPlans annotated in the 1960s note the shortening of the goods stage attached to the south of the goods shed in 1960 and the construction of a ramp to the goods shed and demolition of the cattle yards (by this stage marked as \"trucking yards\") in 1968.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nPlans dated 22 April 1974 show a proposed gang shed and proposed migratory gang camp amenity building on the former site of the cattle yards and fettlers cottage south of the station (west side). These plans also show toilet upgrades to the platform building and the demolition of a separate gents toilet building, the former Station Master's residence being leased to the Boy Scouts, and the former Fettler's house to the west of the level crossing also being leased for private rental accommodation.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nTwo other stations in the district, Jaspers Brush to the south and Toolijooa to the north, opened at the same time, but were closed in 1974 as part of a network-wide rationalisation of low-patronage stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Toolijooa|title= NSWrail.net: Toolijooa Station|first=Rolfe|last=Bozier}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/704479/RevisedTrainAppendices.pdf|title=A changing network: the historical context of lines and closures|first=Jim|last=Longworth|date=November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe Berry Station Master's residence is now disused (2009) but its immediate past use was as a Scout Hall. It is presumably during this period of use as a Scout Hall that most of the internal walls to the front main gable roofed section of the residence were removed.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe South Coast Line south of Kiama is non-electrified single track. Since 2001, most northbound trains from Berry have terminated at Kiama, requiring passengers to change to [[electric multiple unit]] services to [[Wollongong railway station|Wollongong]] and [[Sydney]]. In 2005, then [[Minister for Transport (New South Wales)|Minister for Transport]] [[John Watkins (Australian politician)|John Watkins]] announced that electrification would be extended to the terminus at Bomaderry at an unspecified future date, but the proposal did not progress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-07-01/govt-announces-kiama-bomaderry-rail-electrification/2048898|date=1 July 2005|title=Govt announces Kiama-Bomaderry rail electrification|newspaper=ABC News}}</ref>\n\nBerry and Bomaderry were the last locations in the NSW metropolitan rail network to use the [[Token (railway signalling)|electric staff]] signalling system.

There is a station car park located to the north of the railway station platform. Perimeter fencing for the station is modern powdercoated white aluminium fencing. The Station Master's residence is located northeast of the station platform building, east of the car park.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe railway station is in a picturesque setting with the Illawarra escarpment visible beyond the station buildings, and the single platform and platform buildings are oriented facing south, with the exception of the Out-of-room, which has a door to the north opening into the station car park. The buildings on the platform generally string along the platform east-west. From east to west the buildings are ranged as follows: lamp room; Out-of-room; signal box; platform building; 1979 brick toilet block. The goods and per way [[sheds]] are located at the western end of the station, on the southern side of the railway lines.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Station Master's Residence (1893)\n\nThe 1893 Berry Station Master's residence is a relatively early example of the J2 type Station Master's residence design, having been constructed prior to the 1899 issue of the series of standard plans for these buildings. It is also one of a number of railway residences built at Berry, including a gatekeeper's house at 66 Prince Alfred St. (The other railway residences at Berry are now in private ownership).<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe \"J2\" design is a standard type residence dating from 1885-1920, usually of timber or brick with a high gabled roof with rafters extending to form a veranda across the front of the building, and two chimneys. The buildings featured a simple symmetrical fa\u00e7ade with central four-panel front door, front room windows to either side and a rear skillion service wing. While the overall form remained similar to J1 it was 4&nbsp;ft wider, and provided larger rooms. Plans dated 1903 show new rear extensions to the Station Master's residence.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe residence is located on an unfenced site with a number of large trees, both native and exotic, with the front facade facing west into the Berry Railway Station car park. A straight concrete path leads to the centre of the front [[veranda]] from the station car park. This is a freestanding single storey [[weatherboard]] residence on brick [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] with a gabled corrugated steel roof, a [[Skillion roof|skillion]] corrugated steel roofed veranda across the width of the front of the house. The veranda is carried on 4 timber posts (corner post at southeast corner damaged) and has a timber floor. The residence has a rear section with two skillion roofs and a [[gable]] roofed rear wing to the north-eastern corner of the house, all roofed in corrugated steel. Part of a rear skillion roofed veranda is extant. The front facade is symmetrical, with a central 4 panel front door (now covered over on the exterior) flanked by timber famed double hung windows, each [[Sash window|sash]] having a single vertical glazing bar. The residence originally had 2 brick [[chimneys]] at the apex of the gabled roof, however only the southern of these is extant (note roof is patched in the former location of the northern [[chimney]]). There is a simple brick chimney near the north-eastern corner of the building to service the kitchen, where a hearth is extant. Part of the rear sections have fibro asbestos walls. Windows are generally timber framed double hung with vertical glazing bars to sashes. The front and back doors are timber 4-panel doors with [[fanlight]]s. These doors are blocked up on the outside.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nInternally, walls have been largely removed, leaving only 2 rooms in the main section of the house. There are timber floors and tongue & grooved timber ceilings.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Platform Building (1893)\n\nThe platform building is a long rectangular weatherboard building with a concrete base and a corrugated steel skillion roof sloping towards the rail lines, with the awning supported on cantilevered timber roof beams braced with curved metal braces. All of the rooms open onto the platform with no interconnection between rooms. The building contains a waiting room, station masters office and staff instruments room. The building has aluminium framed double hung windows, with one extant timber framed double hung window frame (in the waiting room); security screen doors and security screens to windows. There are steel [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] to the platform building awning, which faces south, timber beams and a timber valance to the east and west ends of the awning. There are no chimneys to the roof, however there is an extant chimney breast to the waiting room. There is an air-conditioning unit on the roof.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe internal layout of the platform building appears to be relatively intact. There are timber tongue & grooved internal wall linings and ceilings, except in the waiting room. There are operable metal vents to the interior near the top of walls. The waiting room has modern floor tiling and fibre cement sheeting to walls and ceilings, and 2 modern aluminium framed windows, one within an original timber window frame. There are \"staff instruments\" still operating in the room at the eastern end of the platform building. This room has timber tongue & grooved ceiling and walls. The fog signalman's equipment is also located in this room.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Platform Garden Beds and Topiary Shrubs\nThe topiary shrubs and garden beds form part of the station platform's setting and character.<ref name=nswshr-1084-1624>Longworth, 2012, 10</ref> While railway gardens were once fairly common, surviving such elements are becoming rare today.<ref name=nswshr-1084-1625>Stuart Read, pers.comm., 30/7/2013</ref><ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Signal Box (1912)\nThe signal box is a small weatherboard building located directly next to the platform building and is raised on a concrete base, the base being attached to the platform building. The signal box has a corrugated Colorbond skillion roof. Originally this building had no wall on the platform side, however a wall with windows and central doorway has been added.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe original signal lever frame remains within the signal box.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Out of Shed (1893)\nThis is a small weatherboard skillion roofed structure, located east of the signal box, with entrances to both platform and car park behind. It has a solid timber tongue & grooved board sliding doors to the centre of the north and south elevations.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nInterior: The out of shed has a concrete floor and no wall linings.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Lamp room\nThe lamp room is a diminutive gable roofed building with a corrugated steel roof, and a central timber tongue & grooved board door on the north elevation facing the car park.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nInternally, the floor is concrete, and there are no ceilings or wall linings. There is timber shelving installed to the interior of the east wall.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Goods Shed (1893)\nThis is a [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] side shed 36'x l6' with a small timber platform along the rail side and a wider platform at the northern end with sliding timber doors to both road and rail sides. The building is in intact condition however the tracks have recently been removed in changes to the yard layout.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Produce Shed ({{circa}} 1940s):\nThis is a large corrugated steel shed with a gabled corrugated steel roof located west of the goods shed. Noted on c.1974 plans as being leased by Berry Rural Co-op Society.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Platform (1893)\nThe platform face is brick with brick copings and indicates the extension of the platform in 1915 to accommodate longer trains. The centre of the platform has been capped with concrete to raise the height.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Landscape/Natural Features\nThere are significant plantings on the platform, between the station platform buildings, including topiary shrubs. The Shoalhaven LEP 1985 (as amended) lists - as part of Schedule 7: Heritage Items: the Berry Railway Station Group - the following plantings: [[Ilex cornuta]] (Chinese Holly) and [[Gardenia thunbergia]] (Gardenia). In addition, the site of the Station Master's residence contains a number of large mature trees, both native and exotic.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Moveable items\nSignals (in signal box); staff instruments (in room at east end of platform building); fog signalman's equipment (in room at east end of platform building); timber trolley (in Out-of-room); timber indicator board (located between the signal box and the Out-of-room).<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nAs at 4 September 2013, the platform building, signal box, out of room, per way shed, goods shed and platform were in good condition, the lamp room was in moderate condition, the station master's residence was in poor to very poor condition, and the moveable items were in good to very good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nVarious structures such as the timber loading stage, perway shed and cattle yards are no longer extant at Berry, however the core group of 1893 platform buildings, goods shed and Station Master's residence are extant, along with an extensive range of early moveable items which remain in context and a c. 1940s produce shed. While interior fitout to the platform building has altered over time, much of the original fabric is extant. The interior of the Station Master's residence has been extensively altered (most internal walls removed), however it is externally relatively intact, though in poor condition. The signal box is of moderate to high integrity, retaining its signalling equipment and associated items in situ, though has undergone some modifications to its external appearance on the rail side.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n* 1901: awning added to the originally awningless platform building\n* 1903: between 1901 and 1903 a butter factory was constructed east of the rail lines, and new rear extensions constructed to the Station Master's residence\n* 1907: fernery (no longer extant) built to south-western corner of Station Master's residence\n* 1912: Goods siding constructed to serve the Berry Central Butter Factory; signal box constructed.\n* 1913: Goods siding to Butter Factory extended\n* {{circa}} 1915: Platform lengthened {{circa|1915}} for racecourse traffic\n* {{circa}} 1940: Produce shed constructed\n* 1960: shortening of goods stage and construction of ramp to goods shed\n* 1974: internal alterations to platform building\n* {{circa}} 1974: internal alterations to Station Master's residence (removal of most internal walls)\n* 1979: new brick toilet block\n* 1983: internal alterations to platform building\n* {{circa}} 1980s: most internal walls removed from main front gable roofed section of Station Master's residence\n* unknown date: Per way shed demolished<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nBerry Railway Station is of State historical significance as an important country railway station complex built from 1893 to the 1940s, with most of its original 1893 elements intact, including platform buildings, early equipment and the original station masters residence, and for its relationship to the development of the town of Berry.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe Berry Railway Station is of State aesthetic significance as a rare group of simple early weatherboard station buildings including goods shed and Station Master's residence, with later corrugated steel produce shed, located in a picturesque location within the historic Berry township, with the [[Illawarra escarpment]] visible beyond. The small weatherboard Out-of-room, signal box and lamp room are typical of small sheds built extensively for these purposes throughout the state. The Station Master's residence is a representative, now rare, early example of a railway residence, which predates the standard railway residence designs of 1899. The Berry Railway Station group is of technical and research significance for its early moveable items including staff instruments, signals, fog signalman's equipment, early timber trolley and timber indicator board.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nBerry railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nBerry Railway Station is of State historical significance as an important country railway station group built from 1893 to 1912, with most of its original elements intact, including early equipment and the original Station Master's residence, and for its relationship to the development of the town of Berry. The Berry Station Master's residence is of historical significance as one of a number of railway residences constructed at Berry which evidence late 19th century railway operational arrangements to accommodate staff on site, and as an early design residence, constructed prior to the issue of a series of standard plans for railway residences in 1899.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe Berry Station Master's residence design has historical association with Henry Deane, Engineer in Chief for Railways Construction 1891-1901.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBerry Railway Station is of State aesthetic significance as a rare group of simple early weatherboard station buildings with later corrugated steel goods and produce sheds, located in a picturesque location within the historic Berry township, with the Illawarra escarpment visible beyond.

Berry Station was built to serve what was at the time the largest town on the alignment, and opened as part of this extension. The station, constructed by the firm of G. J. Featherstone & T. J. Barbel, included a [[passing loop]], stationmaster's cottage, platform, waiting shed and goods shed. The main platform building contained a ticket office, general waiting room, 'ladies' room' and toilet. The buildings were constructed from [[Clapboard (architecture)|weatherboard]] with [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated steel]] roofs. Though the original plans called for a second platform and waiting shed, these did not eventuate.\n\n1907 plans show the station with the following structures: on the east side of the railway tracks (south to north): Berry Central Butter Factory, engine boiler house, goods shed, and a Fettler's cottage near the level crossing; west side (south to north): cattle yards, Fettler's cottage, levers, platform with horse dock at southern end, platform building, Station Master's residence with a fern house attached to the south-western corner, and a further Fettler's cottage to the west of the level crossing.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n{{Infobox station\n| name = Berry\n| style = NSW TrainLink intercity\n| type = [[NSW TrainLink]] [[Regional rail|intercity train]] station\n| image = Berry train station.jpg\n| alt = Berry railway station\n| caption = \n| address = Station Road, [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry]]\n| borough = [[New South Wales]]\n| country = [[Australia]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|-34.7805|150.6964|display=inline,title}}\n| owned = [[RailCorp]]\n| operator = [[NSW TrainLink]]\n| line = [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast]]\n| distance = 140.8 km from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]]<ref name=asa>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/asa/asa-standards/ts-toc-3.pdf|date=30 April 2015|title=Train Operating Conditions (TOC) Manual \u2013 Track Diagrams (version 3.0)|author=Asset Standards Authority|access-date=19 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174359/http://www.asa.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/asa/asa-standards/ts-toc-3.pdf|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| platforms = 1, 113 metres<ref name=asa />\n| train_operators = [[NSW TrainLink]]\n| structure = Elevated platform\n| parking = Yes\n| bicycle = Yes\n| disabled = Easy Access\n| zone = \n| website = [https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101388#/ Transport for NSW]\n| opened = 2 June 1893<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Berry|title= NSWrail.net: Berry Station|first=Rolfe|last=Bozier}}</ref>\n| passengers = 120 (daily)<ref>{{cite web |author=Bureau of Transport Statistics |url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/documents/2017/Train%20Statistics%202014.pdf |title=Train Statistics 2014 |publisher=Transport NSW |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n| pass_year = 2013\n| pass_rank = 240\n| pass_system = Sydney Trains, NSW TrainLink\n| services = {{s-rail|title=NSW TrainLink}}\n{{s-line|system=NSW TrainLink intercity|line=South Coast Bomaderry|previous=Gerringong|next=Bomaderry (Nowra)}}\n| services_collapsible = 1\n}}The station precinct grew to include the Berry Central Butter Factory, cattle yards, and a number of residences for railway workers. A signal box was added in 1912. In 1912 the goods siding was extended to serve the Berry Central Butter Factory, it being also extended in 1913 to send milk to the [[Sydney]] markets.<ref name=nswshr-1084/> A brick toilet block was added in 1979. Of the former goods yard, today only a small up siding opposite the station and a small down siding to the west remain.<ref name=asa /> With most of its 1893 buildings intact as of 2009, Berry Station is considered state-significant heritage by the [[Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)|Office of Environment & Heritage]]. As the buildings pre-date the standardisation of railway buildings such as cottages, they are relatively rare examples of their type.<ref name=\"heritage\" />\n\nPlans annotated in the 1960s note the shortening of the goods stage attached to the south of the goods shed in 1960 and the construction of a ramp to the goods shed and demolition of the cattle yards (by this stage marked as \"trucking yards\") in 1968.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nPlans dated 22 April 1974 show a proposed gang shed and proposed migratory gang camp amenity building on the former site of the cattle yards and fettlers cottage south of the station (west side). These plans also show toilet upgrades to the platform building and the demolition of a separate gents toilet building, the former Station Master's residence being leased to the Boy Scouts, and the former Fettler's house to the west of the level crossing also being leased for private rental accommodation.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nTwo other stations in the district, Jaspers Brush to the south and Toolijooa to the north, opened at the same time, but were closed in 1974 as part of a network-wide rationalisation of low-patronage stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Toolijooa|title= NSWrail.net: Toolijooa Station|first=Rolfe|last=Bozier}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/704479/RevisedTrainAppendices.pdf|title=A changing network: the historical context of lines and closures|first=Jim|last=Longworth|date=November 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe Berry Station Master's residence is now disused (2009) but its immediate past use was as a Scout Hall.

There is a station car park located to the north of the railway station platform. Perimeter fencing for the station is modern powdercoated white aluminium fencing. The Station Master's residence is located northeast of the station platform building, east of the car park.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe railway station is in a picturesque setting with the Illawarra escarpment visible beyond the station buildings, and the single platform and platform buildings are oriented facing south, with the exception of the Out-of-room, which has a door to the north opening into the station car park. The buildings on the platform generally string along the platform east-west. From east to west the buildings are ranged as follows: lamp room; Out-of-room; signal box; platform building; 1979 brick toilet block. The goods and per way [[sheds]] are located at the western end of the station, on the southern side of the railway lines.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Station Master's Residence (1893)\n\nThe 1893 Berry Station Master's residence is a relatively early example of the J2 type Station Master's residence design, having been constructed prior to the 1899 issue of the series of standard plans for these buildings. It is also one of a number of railway residences built at Berry, including a gatekeeper's house at 66 Prince Alfred St. (The other railway residences at Berry are now in private ownership).<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe \"J2\" design is a standard type residence dating from 1885-1920, usually of timber or brick with a high gabled roof with rafters extending to form a veranda across the front of the building, and two chimneys. The buildings featured a simple symmetrical fa\u00e7ade with central four-panel front door, front room windows to either side and a rear skillion service wing. While the overall form remained similar to J1 it was 4&nbsp;ft wider, and provided larger rooms. Plans dated 1903 show new rear extensions to the Station Master's residence.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe residence is located on an unfenced site with a number of large trees, both native and exotic, with the front facade facing west into the Berry Railway Station car park. A straight concrete path leads to the centre of the front [[veranda]] from the station car park. This is a freestanding single storey [[weatherboard]] residence on brick [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] with a gabled corrugated steel roof, a [[Skillion roof|skillion]] corrugated steel roofed veranda across the width of the front of the house. The veranda is carried on 4 timber posts (corner post at southeast corner damaged) and has a timber floor. The residence has a rear section with two skillion roofs and a [[gable]] roofed rear wing to the north-eastern corner of the house, all roofed in corrugated steel. Part of a rear skillion roofed veranda is extant. The front facade is symmetrical, with a central 4 panel front door (now covered over on the exterior) flanked by timber famed double hung windows, each [[Sash window|sash]] having a single vertical glazing bar. The residence originally had 2 brick [[chimneys]] at the apex of the gabled roof, however only the southern of these is extant (note roof is patched in the former location of the northern [[chimney]]). There is a simple brick chimney near the north-eastern corner of the building to service the kitchen, where a hearth is extant. Part of the rear sections have fibro asbestos walls. Windows are generally timber framed double hung with vertical glazing bars to sashes. The front and back doors are timber 4-panel doors with [[fanlight]]s. These doors are blocked up on the outside.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nInternally, walls have been largely removed, leaving only 2 rooms in the main section of the house. There are timber floors and tongue & grooved timber ceilings.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Platform Building (1893)\n\nThe platform building is a long rectangular weatherboard building with a concrete base and a corrugated steel skillion roof sloping towards the rail lines, with the awning supported on cantilevered timber roof beams braced with curved metal braces. All of the rooms open onto the platform with no interconnection between rooms. The building contains a waiting room, station masters office and staff instruments room. The building has aluminium framed double hung windows, with one extant timber framed double hung window frame (in the waiting room); security screen doors and security screens to windows. There are steel [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] to the platform building awning, which faces south, timber beams and a timber valance to the east and west ends of the awning. There are no chimneys to the roof, however there is an extant chimney breast to the waiting room. There is an air-conditioning unit on the roof.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe internal layout of the platform building appears to be relatively intact. There are timber tongue & grooved internal wall linings and ceilings, except in the waiting room. There are operable metal vents to the interior near the top of walls. The waiting room has modern floor tiling and fibre cement sheeting to walls and ceilings, and 2 modern aluminium framed windows, one within an original timber window frame. There are \"staff instruments\" still operating in the room at the eastern end of the platform building. This room has timber tongue & grooved ceiling and walls. The fog signalman's equipment is also located in this room.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Platform Garden Beds and Topiary Shrubs\nThe topiary shrubs and garden beds form part of the station platform's setting and character.<ref name=nswshr-1084-1624>Longworth, 2012, 10</ref> While railway gardens were once fairly common, surviving such elements are becoming rare today.<ref name=nswshr-1084-1625>Stuart Read, pers.comm., 30/7/2013</ref><ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Signal Box (1912)\nThe signal box is a small weatherboard building located directly next to the platform building and is raised on a concrete base, the base being attached to the platform building. The signal box has a corrugated Colorbond skillion roof. Originally this building had no wall on the platform side, however a wall with windows and central doorway has been added.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe original signal lever frame remains within the signal box.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Out of Shed (1893)\nThis is a small weatherboard skillion roofed structure, located east of the signal box, with entrances to both platform and car park behind. It has a solid timber tongue & grooved board sliding doors to the centre of the north and south elevations.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nInterior: The out of shed has a concrete floor and no wall linings.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Lamp room\nThe lamp room is a diminutive gable roofed building with a corrugated steel roof, and a central timber tongue & grooved board door on the north elevation facing the car park.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nInternally, the floor is concrete, and there are no ceilings or wall linings. There is timber shelving installed to the interior of the east wall.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Goods Shed (1893)\nThis is a [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] side shed 36'x l6' with a small timber platform along the rail side and a wider platform at the northern end with sliding timber doors to both road and rail sides. The building is in intact condition however the tracks have recently been removed in changes to the yard layout.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Produce Shed ({{circa}} 1940s):\nThis is a large corrugated steel shed with a gabled corrugated steel roof located west of the goods shed. Noted on c.1974 plans as being leased by Berry Rural Co-op Society.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Platform (1893)\nThe platform face is brick with brick copings and indicates the extension of the platform in 1915 to accommodate longer trains. The centre of the platform has been capped with concrete to raise the height.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Landscape/Natural Features\nThere are significant plantings on the platform, between the station platform buildings, including topiary shrubs. The Shoalhaven LEP 1985 (as amended) lists - as part of Schedule 7: Heritage Items: the Berry Railway Station Group - the following plantings: [[Ilex cornuta]] (Chinese Holly) and [[Gardenia thunbergia]] (Gardenia). In addition, the site of the Station Master's residence contains a number of large mature trees, both native and exotic.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n;Moveable items\nSignals (in signal box); staff instruments (in room at east end of platform building); fog signalman's equipment (in room at east end of platform building); timber trolley (in Out-of-room); timber indicator board (located between the signal box and the Out-of-room).<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nAs at 4 September 2013, the platform building, signal box, out of room, per way shed, goods shed and platform were in good condition, the lamp room was in moderate condition, the station master's residence was in poor to very poor condition, and the moveable items were in good to very good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nVarious structures such as the timber loading stage, perway shed and cattle yards are no longer extant at Berry, however the core group of 1893 platform buildings, goods shed and Station Master's residence are extant, along with an extensive range of early moveable items which remain in context and a c. 1940s produce shed. While interior fitout to the platform building has altered over time, much of the original fabric is extant. The interior of the Station Master's residence has been extensively altered (most internal walls removed), however it is externally relatively intact, though in poor condition. The signal box is of moderate to high integrity, retaining its signalling equipment and associated items in situ, though has undergone some modifications to its external appearance on the rail side.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n* 1901: awning added to the originally awningless platform building\n* 1903: between 1901 and 1903 a butter factory was constructed east of the rail lines, and new rear extensions constructed to the Station Master's residence\n* 1907: fernery (no longer extant) built to south-western corner of Station Master's residence\n* 1912: Goods siding constructed to serve the Berry Central Butter Factory; signal box constructed.\n* 1913: Goods siding to Butter Factory extended\n* {{circa}} 1915: Platform lengthened {{circa|1915}} for racecourse traffic\n* {{circa}} 1940: Produce shed constructed\n* 1960: shortening of goods stage and construction of ramp to goods shed\n* 1974: internal alterations to platform building\n* {{circa}} 1974: internal alterations to Station Master's residence (removal of most internal walls)\n* 1979: new brick toilet block\n* 1983: internal alterations to platform building\n* {{circa}} 1980s: most internal walls removed from main front gable roofed section of Station Master's residence\n* unknown date: Per way shed demolished<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nBerry Railway Station is of State historical significance as an important country railway station complex built from 1893 to the 1940s, with most of its original 1893 elements intact, including platform buildings, early equipment and the original station masters residence, and for its relationship to the development of the town of Berry.<ref name=nswshr-1084/>\n\nThe Berry Railway Station is of State aesthetic significance as a rare group of simple early weatherboard station buildings including goods shed and Station Master's residence, with later corrugated steel produce shed, located in a picturesque location within the historic Berry township, with the [[Illawarra escarpment]] visible beyond. The small weatherboard Out-of-room, signal box and lamp room are typical of small sheds built extensively for these purposes throughout the state. The Station Master's residence is a representative, now rare, early example of a railway residence, which predates the standard railway residence designs of 1899.

Lachish is located in the [[Shephelah]] region of [[Israel]] between [[Mount Hebron]] and the Mediterranean coast. It is first mentioned in the [[Amarna letters]] as ''Lakisha-Laki\u0161a'' ([[Amarna letter EA 287|EA 287]], 288, 328, 329, 335). According to the Bible, the Israelites captured and destroyed Lachish for joining the league against the [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeonites]] ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:31-33).

It is mentioned in the Amarna letters as Lakisha-Laki\u0161a (EA 287, 288, 328, 329, 335).\n\nDuring the 20th Dynasty of Egypt, the Egyptian Empire started to loose its control in the Southern Levant. While Lachish had prospered under Egyptian hegemony, it was completely destroyed by fire around 1150 BC. It was rebuilt by Canaanites who built two temples. However, this settlement was soon destroyed by another fire around 1130 BC (cf. nearby fortified [[Eglon, Canaan|Eglon]], Philistines). The site then remained abandoned for a long period of time. The reasons for these destructions may have been rebellions and invasions by the Sea Peoples.\n\n===Iron Age===\nRebuilding of the city began in the Early [[Iron Age]] during the 10th and 9th centuries BCE when it was part of Judah. The unfortified settlement may have been destroyed c. 925 BCE by Egyptian Pharaoh [[Sheshonk I]].<ref name=King/> In the first half of the 9th century BCE, under the kings [[Asa of Judah|Asa]] and [[Jehoshaphat]], Lachish became an important city in the [[kingdom of Judah]].

Sennacherib later devoted a whole room in his \"Palace without a rival\", the South-west palace in [[Nineveh]], for [[Lachish relief|artistic representations]] of the siege on large [[alabaster]] slabs, most of which are now on display in the [[British Museum]]. They hold depictions of Assyrian siege ramps, battering rams, sappers, and other siege machines and army units, along with Lachish's architecture and its final surrender.

However, the city fell to [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] in his campaign against Judah in 586&nbsp;BCE.\n\nModern excavation of the site has revealed that the Assyrians built a stone and dirt ramp up to the level of the Lachish city wall, thereby allowing the soldiers to charge up the ramp and storm the city. Excavations revealed approximately 1,500 skulls in one of the caves near the site, and hundreds of arrowheads on the ramp and at the top of the city wall, indicating the ferocity of the battle.

Under the Babylonian or [[Achaemenid Empire]], a large altar (known as the Solar Shrine) on the east section of the mound was built. The shrine was abandoned after the area fell in the hands of [[Alexander the Great]]. The tell has been unoccupied since then.<ref name=King/>\n\n==Biblical references==\nLachish ({{lang-he-n|\u05dc\u05b8\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1}}) is mentioned in several books in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The [[Book of Joshua]] refers to Lachish in Chapter 10 (verses 3, 5, 23, and 31-35), describing the Israelite conquest of Caanan. Japhia, the King of Lachish, is listed as one of the Five [[Amorite]] Kings that allied to repel the invasion. After a surprise attack from the Israelites, the kings took refuge in a cave, where they were captured and put to death. Joshua and the Israelites then took the city of Lachish after a two-day siege, exterminating the populace. In 12:11, the King of Lachish is mentioned as one of the thirty-one kings conquered by Joshua. The city is assigned to the [[Tribe of Judah]] in 15:39 as part of the western foothills.\n\nRehoboam son of Solomon's fortifications of Lachish are recorded in [[Books of Chronicles|II Chronicles]] (11:9). In [[Books of Kings|II Kings]] (14:19) and II Chronicles 25:27, [[Amaziah of Judah]] flees to Lachish after he was defeated by [[Jehoash of Israel]], where he is captured and executed.\n\nThe [[Book of Micah]] (1:13) warns the residents of Lachish that the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians will soon spread to Judah. II Kings 18:14 mentions the Siege of Lachish; Hezekiah sends a message there offering tribute to Sennacherib in exchange for the city. In verse 17, the Assyrians leave Lachish and head to Jerusalem to begin the unsuccessful [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem]].

It is mentioned in the Amarna letters as Lakisha-Laki\u0161a (EA 287, 288, 328, 329, 335).\n\nDuring the 20th Dynasty of Egypt, the Egyptian Empire started to loose its control in the Southern Levant. While Lachish had prospered under Egyptian hegemony, it was completely destroyed by fire around 1150 BC. It was rebuilt by Canaanites who built two temples. However, this settlement was soon destroyed by another fire around 1130 BC (cf. nearby fortified [[Eglon, Canaan|Eglon]], Philistines). The site then remained abandoned for a long period of time. The reasons for these destructions may have been rebellions and invasions by the Sea Peoples.\n\n===Iron Age===\nRebuilding of the city began in the Early [[Iron Age]] during the 10th and 9th centuries BCE when it was part of Judah. The unfortified settlement may have been destroyed c. 925 BCE by Egyptian Pharaoh [[Sheshonk I]].<ref name=King/> In the first half of the 9th century BCE, under the kings [[Asa of Judah|Asa]] and [[Jehoshaphat]], Lachish became an important city in the [[kingdom of Judah]]. It was heavily fortified with massive walls and ramparts and a royal palace was built on a platform in the center of the city.<ref name=King/> Lachish was the foremost among several fortified cities and strongholds guarding the valleys that lead up to Jerusalem and the interior of the country against enemies which usually approached from the coast.\n \n[[File:Lachish inscription.jpeg|left|thumb|The single inscription which identifies the location depicted in the reliefs reads: \"Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment, before (or at the entrance of) the city of Lachish (Lakhisha).

Sennacherib later devoted a whole room in his \"Palace without a rival\", the South-west palace in [[Nineveh]], for [[Lachish relief|artistic representations]] of the siege on large [[alabaster]] slabs, most of which are now on display in the [[British Museum]]. They hold depictions of Assyrian siege ramps, battering rams, sappers, and other siege machines and army units, along with Lachish's architecture and its final surrender. In combination with the archaeological finds, they give a good understanding of siege warfare of the period.<ref>William H.

However, the city fell to [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]] in his campaign against Judah in 586&nbsp;BCE.\n\nModern excavation of the site has revealed that the Assyrians built a stone and dirt ramp up to the level of the Lachish city wall, thereby allowing the soldiers to charge up the ramp and storm the city. Excavations revealed approximately 1,500 skulls in one of the caves near the site, and hundreds of arrowheads on the ramp and at the top of the city wall, indicating the ferocity of the battle. The city occupied an area of {{convert|8|ha}} and was finally destroyed in 587&nbsp;BCE.<ref name=rocca>{{cite book|last=Samuel|first=Rocca|title=The Fortifications of Ancient Israel and Judah 1200\u2013586 BC|year=2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=9781782005216|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lepkNC_gqs4C&pg=PA32}}</ref> Residents were exiled as part of the [[Babylonian captivity]].<ref name=King/>\n\nDuring Babylonian occupation, a large residence was built on the platform that had once supported the Israeli palace. At the end of the captivity, some exiled Jews returned to Lachish and built a new city with fortifications. Under the Babylonian or [[Achaemenid Empire]], a large altar (known as the Solar Shrine) on the east section of the mound was built. The shrine was abandoned after the area fell in the hands of [[Alexander the Great]]. The tell has been unoccupied since then.<ref name=King/>\n\n==Biblical references==\nLachish ({{lang-he-n|\u05dc\u05b8\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1}}) is mentioned in several books in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The [[Book of Joshua]] refers to Lachish in Chapter 10 (verses 3, 5, 23, and 31-35), describing the Israelite conquest of Caanan. Japhia, the King of Lachish, is listed as one of the Five [[Amorite]] Kings that allied to repel the invasion. After a surprise attack from the Israelites, the kings took refuge in a cave, where they were captured and put to death. Joshua and the Israelites then took the city of Lachish after a two-day siege, exterminating the populace. In 12:11, the King of Lachish is mentioned as one of the thirty-one kings conquered by Joshua. The city is assigned to the [[Tribe of Judah]] in 15:39 as part of the western foothills.\n\nRehoboam son of Solomon's fortifications of Lachish are recorded in [[Books of Chronicles|II Chronicles]] (11:9). In [[Books of Kings|II Kings]] (14:19) and II Chronicles 25:27, [[Amaziah of Judah]] flees to Lachish after he was defeated by [[Jehoash of Israel]], where he is captured and executed.\n\nThe [[Book of Micah]] (1:13) warns the residents of Lachish that the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians will soon spread to Judah. II Kings 18:14 mentions the Siege of Lachish; Hezekiah sends a message there offering tribute to Sennacherib in exchange for the city. In verse 17, the Assyrians leave Lachish and head to Jerusalem to begin the unsuccessful [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem]]. This is also mentioned in II Chronicles 32:9 and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 36:2. The Israelites learn of the departure of the Assyrians from Lachish in II Kings 19:8 and Isaiah 37:8.\n\nThe [[Book of Jeremiah]] (34:7) lists Lachish as one of the last three fortified cities in Judah to fall to the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. In the [[Book of Nehemiah]] (11:30) Lachish is mentioned as an area where the people of Judah settled during the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].\n\nThe Assyrian campaign against Lachish is documented in a series of wall reliefs, now on display in the British Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/galleries/middle_east/room_10_assyria_lion_hunts.aspx|title=Room 10: Assyria: Lion hunts|website=British Museum}}</ref>\n\n==Identification==\nInitially, Lachish was identified by [[Flinders Petrie]] with [[Tell el-Hesi]], an identification supported when a relevant cuneiform tablet was found there.<ref>G.

It began airing on December 5, 2005, hosted by stand-up comedian [[Ben Bailey]], and aired its last episode on September 28, 2012. The show was revived on December 4, 2017. It is part of the global ''[[Cash Cab (British game show)|Cash Cab]]'' franchise that originated in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile Bailey's show took place in New York City, some episodes of season six took place in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].  Contestants who ultimately hailed the Cash Cab were not made aware that they were part of the game until they hired the cab and Bailey informed them of the show and its rules.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, Discovery Channel began airing a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] edition of the program, ''Cash Cab: After Dark'', in which contestants were picked up near or after sunset as well as overnight and the cash value of the questions was double that of the regular version of the show. The questions were usually more difficult than the daytime version.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, it was announced that the series would be revived. It premiered on October 7, 2019 on [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bravo Is Reviving the Popular Emmy Award-Winning Gameshow \"Cash Cab\" from Lion Television|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/07/02/bravo-is-reviving-the-popular-emmy-award-winning-gameshow-cash-cab-from-lion-television-213110/20190702bravo01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=July 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bravo's Revival of Popular Gameshow \"Cash Cab\" Premieres Monday, October 7 at 11:30PM ET/PT|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/09/19/bravos-revival-of-popular-gameshow-cash-cab-premieres-monday-october-7-at-1130pm-et-pt-136414/20190919bravo01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=September 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bravotv.com/cash-cab/episode-guide|title=Episode Guide {{!}} Cash Cab|date=2019-09-19|website=Bravo TV Official Site|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\nAccording to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Discovery Channel initially ordered 40 episodes from Lion Television (with Executive Producers Tom Cohen, Allison Corn, and Tony Tackaberry with Ben Bailey being the most recent) and taping of the initial run was completed in November 2005 before the show premiered that December.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/news/lion-tv-strikes-it-rich-with-format-shows-1117933650|title=Lion TV strikes it rich with format shows|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 29, 2005}}</ref> A new set of 40 episodes were taped and aired in 2006 and 2007.

Another 40 episodes were taped for airing in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe sixth season premiered on February 14, 2011, at 6:00 p.m. E/P. During a hiatus, Ben Bailey did a standup special recounting his time as host of the show. He correctly stated in the special that the show has been cancelled for the last two years (taping for the then-current series wrapped in 2008), however, a renewal offer was made after the standup concert was taped during 2011 returning the show to the schedule.

While the only rules given on-camera after the introduction and before asking \"Do you want to play?\" pertain to his or her driving and the \"three strikes and you're out\" rule, the contestants are also informed that once their traveling begins, the cab will not take detours of any kind unless directed by a police officer, stop sign, traffic light or other legal means of diverting traffic. Bailey or Melewski offers them the chance to get out of the cab if they do not wish to play, and contestants who choose to play the game must stay in the cab until they reach their destination or get three strikes.\n\nFor the first season, the first five questions were worth $25 each, the next five questions were worth $50 each, and any question thereafter was worth $100. For the second season, the first four questions were worth $25 each, the next four were worth $50 each, and the ninth and succeeding questions were worth $100. In ''Cash Cab: After Dark'' - and beginning with the regular episodes of Season 3 - all of the money values were doubled to $50, $100, and $200. Beginning in the fourth season, some games were designated as Double Ride games, making the question values $100, $200, and $400.\n\nEach wrong answer earns the contestant(s) a strike. On the third strike, they forfeit all their winnings and Bailey or Melewski will immediately pull over and kick them out of the cab. Once players have exited the Cash Cab, a camera crew from the trailing production van is already on the street waiting to tape their departure.\n\n===Red Light Challenge===\nWhen a contestant has won at least $200 or $300 in a normal game or an After Dark game - or at least $400 or $600 on a Double Ride, and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, Bailey or Melewski will announce a Red Light Challenge. He or she reads a question that has multiple correct answers usually four to seven and the passenger(s) have 30 seconds to give those answers; they do not always have to give all of the answers. Since there is no penalty for an incorrect answer, giving all the correct answers in the allotted time is worth $250 or $500 during Double Ride games regardless of how many incorrect answers a contestant might also blurt out along the way. The contestant does not receive the extra $250 (or $500) if the 30-second time limit runs out; it is also not counted as a strike, and the contestant doesn't lose any accumulated money. While only one Red Light Challenge is usually played per game, beginning in Season 4 there are multiple Red Light Challenges during certain games at least two per game with the second for accumulating at least $1,000 in revival season it was sponsored by Cash app\n\n===Shout-Outs===\nContestants have two forms of help known as \"Shout-Outs\" at their disposal during the game; each can be used only once, and neither may be used on a Red Light Challenge or a Video Bonus. In the Mobile Shout-Out, the contestant makes a phone call to someone they choose by means of a cell phone either provided by Bailey or Melewski or one belonging to a contestant if they have one. The call can take up to a maximum of 15 seconds before the contestant has to give an answer, with the result being either additional money or a strike. The contestant may also elect to use a Street Shout-Out, in which Bailey or Melewski immediately pulls the cab to a curb so that anyone on the sidewalk can be asked for help, without any official time limit. A second Street Shout-Out is included on a Double Ride meaning they can ask another person but no second Mobile Shout-out meaning they can't call another person. In the revived Cash Cab, the Mobile Shout-Out was replaced by the Social Media Shout-Out, in which Ben activates Facebook Live so that those on the site may help the contestant.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/tv/cash-cab-back-discovery-channel/|title=Cash Cab Is Coming Back to TV (with Celebrity Guests!)

Bailey/Melewski plays a video clip and asks the contestant(s) a single question based on its content. If the question is answered correctly, the contestant(s) win double what they have earned so far, but if they are wrong, they lose all of their money \"at the very last moment\", as Bailey says, and \"leave with nothing but a cab ride\".\n\nUnlike some other versions of the game, U.S. contestants who decline to attempt the Video Bonus are not shown the question they would have been asked.\n\n===Double Ride===\nBeginning in Season 4, this rarely occurring part of the show happens when randomly selected passengers are able to win double the amount of money of a normal game. The first four questions are worth $100, the second four are worth $200 and the rest until the end of the game are worth $400. The \"Red Light Challenge\" is worth $500.\n\n==Record payouts==\nThe current record of $6,200 won on one ride is held by Sam Meyer (riding solo, on a Double Ride, taking and winning the Double-or-Nothing Video Bonus question) on the episode that aired May 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121443709962505255?mod=opinion_journal_leisure_art|title= He Drives This Game-Show Vehicle|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | first=Joanne | last=Kaufman | date=June 26, 2008}}</ref> This topped the old record held by contestants Sean Devney and Steve Irolla, two New York City tour guides who won $4,100 after answering the \"Video Bonus\" question correctly. They reached their final destination with two strikes (both on $200 questions).\n\n==Special editions==\nOne episode of the program was a special celebrity edition, featuring actor [[Thomas Haden Church]] of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players [[Jed Ortmeyer]] and [[Ryan Hollweg]] of the [[New York Rangers]] and journalist [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], formerly of [[CBS]]' ''[[The Early Show]]''. All played for a charity of their choice, and Discovery Channel matched the contestants' winnings. Another episode was a special in which the passengers were asked questions relating to the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''. In this episode, the host of ''[[Cash Cab (Canadian game show)|Cash Cab: Canada]]'', [[Adam Growe]], was driving the cab instead of [[Ben Bailey]].\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Discovery aired a charity episode of ''Cash Cab'' for its 250th episode featuring two rides by boat crew members from ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. ''[[FV Time Bandit|Time Bandit]]'' co-captain Andy Hillstrand and Josh Harris, son of ''[[FV Cornelia Marie|Cornelia Marie]]'' captain [[Phil Harris (fisherman)|Phil Harris]], went against [[Sig Hansen]] (captain of the [[FV Northwestern|''Northwestern'']]) and his two brothers. All cash values were doubled from the Season 3 payouts, the passengers received a second Street Shout-Out, and all money earned was donated by the passengers to the charities of their choice.\n\nIn the ''Cash Cab: Las Vegas'' episodes, filmed in May 2010 and broadcast beginning in August of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2010/8/9/114010/3894/vegas-travel/Cash+Cab+Shouts+Out+To+Vegas+Tonightl?mod=art|title= Cash Cab Shouts Out To Vegas Tonight|publisher = Vegas Chatter | date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> celebrities play for charity and civilians play for themselves. Guests have included [[Mayor of Las Vegas]], [[Oscar Goodman]], comedian [[David Brenner]], the band [[Neon Trees]] and magicians [[Penn & Teller]]. The prizes are sometimes doubled in a \"[[Blackjack#Player decisions|Double Down]] Ride\", just like on the regular show. In the event they strike out or miss the Video Bonus question, their charities receive $500, though some celebrities decide to also chip in with the amount of money lost, out of their own pockets.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nOn December 4, 2017, Discovery aired a special Celebrity Edition, where as the unsuspecting passengers hailed the Cash Cab, they were joined by celebrities to help them, featuring ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' actor Scott Bakula, actor & comedian [[Gilbert Gottfried]], and ''[[Friends]]'' actor Matthew Perry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/11/28/cash-cab-ben-bailey-discovery-celebrities-revival/887237001/|title=The meter is running again: We climb into the 'Cash Cab' with Ben Bailey|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Taglines==\nThe show's tagline in the first two seasons was: \"There are 13,000 cabs in New York City, but there's only ''one'' that pays ''you''!\" Starting in season three, the tagline was modified: \"There are 13,000 cabs in the streets of the Big Apple, but there's only ''one'' that pays ''you''!\" On ''Cash Cab: After Dark'', the tagline is: \"Every night, 13,000 cabs hit the streets of the city that never sleeps, but there's only ''one'' that pays ''you''!\"\n\n==''Cash Cab: Chicago''==\nDuring Season 6 of ''Cash Cab'', a new spin-off series, ''Cash Cab: Chicago'', hosted by comedian Beth Melewski and using the same rules as its New York counterpart, aired.

The rear of the cab behind the seats contains ten recording decks and other production equipment.\n\nThe lighting and the music that go off when contestants enter the cab consist of a switchboard that is connected to an [[iPod]] and the car stereo. The Video Bonus monitor is a DVD player that is embedded to the back of the front passenger seat.\n\nSome contestants are randomly picked as they walk along the sidewalk, while others are selected in advance.

It began airing on December 5, 2005, hosted by stand-up comedian [[Ben Bailey]], and aired its last episode on September 28, 2012. The show was revived on December 4, 2017. It is part of the global ''[[Cash Cab (British game show)|Cash Cab]]'' franchise that originated in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile Bailey's show took place in New York City, some episodes of season six took place in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].  Contestants who ultimately hailed the Cash Cab were not made aware that they were part of the game until they hired the cab and Bailey informed them of the show and its rules.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, Discovery Channel began airing a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] edition of the program, ''Cash Cab: After Dark'', in which contestants were picked up near or after sunset as well as overnight and the cash value of the questions was double that of the regular version of the show. The questions were usually more difficult than the daytime version.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, it was announced that the series would be revived.

During a hiatus, Ben Bailey did a standup special recounting his time as host of the show.

While the only rules given on-camera after the introduction and before asking \"Do you want to play?\" pertain to his or her driving and the \"three strikes and you're out\" rule, the contestants are also informed that once their traveling begins, the cab will not take detours of any kind unless directed by a police officer, stop sign, traffic light or other legal means of diverting traffic. Bailey or Melewski offers them the chance to get out of the cab if they do not wish to play, and contestants who choose to play the game must stay in the cab until they reach their destination or get three strikes.\n\nFor the first season, the first five questions were worth $25 each, the next five questions were worth $50 each, and any question thereafter was worth $100. For the second season, the first four questions were worth $25 each, the next four were worth $50 each, and the ninth and succeeding questions were worth $100. In ''Cash Cab: After Dark'' - and beginning with the regular episodes of Season 3 - all of the money values were doubled to $50, $100, and $200. Beginning in the fourth season, some games were designated as Double Ride games, making the question values $100, $200, and $400.\n\nEach wrong answer earns the contestant(s) a strike. On the third strike, they forfeit all their winnings and Bailey or Melewski will immediately pull over and kick them out of the cab. Once players have exited the Cash Cab, a camera crew from the trailing production van is already on the street waiting to tape their departure.\n\n===Red Light Challenge===\nWhen a contestant has won at least $200 or $300 in a normal game or an After Dark game - or at least $400 or $600 on a Double Ride, and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, Bailey or Melewski will announce a Red Light Challenge. He or she reads a question that has multiple correct answers usually four to seven and the passenger(s) have 30 seconds to give those answers; they do not always have to give all of the answers. Since there is no penalty for an incorrect answer, giving all the correct answers in the allotted time is worth $250 or $500 during Double Ride games regardless of how many incorrect answers a contestant might also blurt out along the way. The contestant does not receive the extra $250 (or $500) if the 30-second time limit runs out; it is also not counted as a strike, and the contestant doesn't lose any accumulated money. While only one Red Light Challenge is usually played per game, beginning in Season 4 there are multiple Red Light Challenges during certain games at least two per game with the second for accumulating at least $1,000 in revival season it was sponsored by Cash app\n\n===Shout-Outs===\nContestants have two forms of help known as \"Shout-Outs\" at their disposal during the game; each can be used only once, and neither may be used on a Red Light Challenge or a Video Bonus. In the Mobile Shout-Out, the contestant makes a phone call to someone they choose by means of a cell phone either provided by Bailey or Melewski or one belonging to a contestant if they have one. The call can take up to a maximum of 15 seconds before the contestant has to give an answer, with the result being either additional money or a strike. The contestant may also elect to use a Street Shout-Out, in which Bailey or Melewski immediately pulls the cab to a curb so that anyone on the sidewalk can be asked for help, without any official time limit. A second Street Shout-Out is included on a Double Ride meaning they can ask a another person but no second Mobile Shout-out meaning they can't call a another person. In the revived Cash Cab, the Mobile Shout-Out was replaced by the Social Media Shout-Out, in which Ben activates Facebook Live so that those on the site may help the contestant.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/tv/cash-cab-back-discovery-channel/|title=Cash Cab Is Coming Back to TV (with Celebrity Guests!)

Bailey/Melewski plays a video clip and asks the contestant(s) a single question based on its content. If the question is answered correctly, the contestant(s) win double what they have earned so far, but if they are wrong, they lose all of their money \"at the very last moment\", as Bailey says, and \"leave with nothing but a cab ride\".\n\nUnlike some other versions of the game, U.S. contestants who decline to attempt the Video Bonus are not shown the question they would have been asked.\n\n===Double Ride===\nBeginning in Season 4, this rarely occurring part of the show happens when randomly selected passengers are able to win double the amount of money of a normal game. The first four questions are worth $100, the second four are worth $200 and the rest until the end of the game are worth $400. The \"Red Light Challenge\" is worth $500.\n\n==Record payouts==\nThe current record of $6,200 won on one ride is held by Sam Meyer (riding solo, on a Double Ride, taking and winning the Double-or-Nothing Video Bonus question) on the episode that aired May 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121443709962505255?mod=opinion_journal_leisure_art|title= He Drives This Game-Show Vehicle|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | first=Joanne | last=Kaufman | date=June 26, 2008}}</ref> This topped the old record held by contestants Sean Devney and Steve Irolla, two New York City tour guides who won $4,100 after answering the \"Video Bonus\" question correctly. They reached their final destination with two strikes (both on $200 questions).\n\n==Special editions==\nOne episode of the program was a special celebrity edition, featuring actor [[Thomas Haden Church]] of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players [[Jed Ortmeyer]] and [[Ryan Hollweg]] of the [[New York Rangers]] and journalist [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], formerly of [[CBS]]' ''[[The Early Show]]''. All played for a charity of their choice, and Discovery Channel matched the contestants' winnings. Another episode was a special in which the passengers were asked questions relating to the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''. In this episode, the host of ''[[Cash Cab (Canadian game show)|Cash Cab: Canada]]'', [[Adam Growe]], was driving the cab instead of [[Ben Bailey]].\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Discovery aired a charity episode of ''Cash Cab'' for its 250th episode featuring two rides by boat crew members from ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. ''[[FV Time Bandit|Time Bandit]]'' co-captain Andy Hillstrand and Josh Harris, son of ''[[FV Cornelia Marie|Cornelia Marie]]'' captain [[Phil Harris (fisherman)|Phil Harris]], went against [[Sig Hansen]] (captain of the [[FV Northwestern|''Northwestern'']]) and his two brothers. All cash values were doubled from the Season 3 payouts, the passengers received a second Street Shout-Out, and all money earned was donated by the passengers to the charities of their choice.\n\nIn the ''Cash Cab: Las Vegas'' episodes, filmed in May 2010 and broadcast beginning in August of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2010/8/9/114010/3894/vegas-travel/Cash+Cab+Shouts+Out+To+Vegas+Tonightl?mod=art|title= Cash Cab Shouts Out To Vegas Tonight|publisher = Vegas Chatter | date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> celebrities play for charity and civilians play for themselves.

The rear of the cab behind the seats contains ten recording decks and other production equipment.\n\nThe lighting and the music that go off when contestants enter the cab consist of a switchboard that is connected to an [[iPod]] and the car stereo. The Video Bonus monitor is a DVD player that is embedded to the back of the front passenger seat.\n\nSome contestants are randomly picked as they walk along the sidewalk, while others are selected in advance.
