{"title_page": "Cleon", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{inline|date=March 2019}}\n'''Cleon''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|l|i\u02d0|\u0252|n|,_|-|\u0259|n}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:\u039a\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd|\u039a\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd]]}} ''Kleon'', {{IPA-el|kl\u00e9\u0254\u02d0n|anc}}; died 422 BC) was an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[strategos|general]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. He was the first prominent representative of the commercial class in Athenian politics, although he was an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] himself. His contemporaries, the historian [[Thucydides]] and the comedic playwright [[Aristophanes]], both represent him as an unscrupulous, warmongering [[demagogue]], but both of them had strong motives to present Cleon unfavorably.\n\n==Public service==\n===Opposition to Pericles===\nCleon first came to notice as an opponent of [[Pericles]] in the late 430s BCE through his opposition to Pericles' strategy of refusing battle against the [[Peloponnesian League]] invaders in 431 BCE.  As a result, he found himself acting in concert with the Athenian aristocratic parties, who also had no liking for Pericles. During 430 BCE, after the unsuccessful expedition by Pericles to the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]], and when the city was devastated by the [[Plague of Athens|plague]], Cleon headed the opposition to Pericles' rule. At this time, Pericles was accused by Cleon of maladministration of public money, with the result of Pericles being found guilty and removed from office.<ref>[[George Grote]]. ''History of Greece'', abridged ed., 1907, p.&nbsp;406, note 1</ref> However, Pericles' setback was temporary and he was soon reinstated.\n\n===Rise in popularity===\nThe death of Pericles from the plague in 429 BCE left the field clear for new leadership in Athens. Hitherto Cleon had only been a vigorous opposition speaker, a trenchant critic and accuser of state officials, but he now came forward as the professed champion and leader of the [[democracy]] and rapidly came to dominate Athenian politics.  Although rough and unpolished, he was charismatic, with natural eloquence and a powerful voice, and he knew how to work upon the emotions of the Athenian populace. He strengthened his support amongst the poorer citizens by increasing the pay for jury work, which provided a livelihood for many of the poorer Athenians.\n\nThe fondness of the Athenians for litigation increased his power; and the practice of \"[[sycophant|sycophancy]]\" (raking up material for false charges) enabled him to remove those who were likely to endanger his ascendancy. In 426 BCE, Cleon brought an unsuccessful prosecution against [[Laches (person)|Laches]] based on his [[Strategos|generalship]] in the unsuccessful first Sicilian expedition.  This is one of the very few times that an Athenian general escaped civil punishment for a defeat.  Having no further use for his former aristocratic associates, he broke off all connection with them, and thus felt at liberty to attack the secret combinations for political purposes, the oligarchical clubs to which they mostly belonged. Whether he also introduced a property-tax for military purposes, and even held a high position connected with the treasury, is uncertain.\n\n===War against Sparta, subsequent death===\nCleon's ruling principles were an inveterate hatred of the nobility, and an equal hatred of Sparta. It was mainly through him that the opportunity of concluding an honourable peace (in 425 BCE) was lost, and in his determination to see [[Sparta]] defeated, often spoke of dazzling future benefits. He insisted upon Athenian security via strategic possession of territories rather than by Spartan goodwill.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Peloponnesian_War.html?id=NSDgGwAACAAJ|title=The Peloponnesian War|last=Kagan|first=Donald|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780142004371|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 427 BCE, Cleon urged his Athenian countrymen to put to death the whole adult male population of [[Mytilene]], which had put itself at the head of a revolt. His proposal, though at first accepted, was soon rescinded due to a protracted rebuttal by [[Diodotus (son of Eucrates)|Diodotus]]. Nonetheless approximately one thousand chief leaders and prominent men of Mytilene were executed. In 425 BCE, Cleon reached the summit of his fame by capturing and transporting to Athens the Spartans who had been blockaded at the [[Battle of Sphacteria]]. Much of the credit was probably due to the military skill of his colleague [[Demosthenes (general)|Demosthenes]] (not the orator); but it was due to Cleon's determination that the [[ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] sent out the additional force that was needed.\n\nIt was almost certainly due to Cleon that the tribute of the \"allies\" was doubled in 425 BCE. In 422 BCE he was sent to recapture [[Amphipolis]], but was outmaneuvered by the Spartan general [[Brasidas]]. However, both Brasidas and Cleon were killed at Amphipolis and their deaths removed the chief obstacle to peace. Thus, in 421 BCE the [[peace of Nicias]] was signed.\n\n==Aristophanes and Thucydides on Cleon==\nThe character of Cleon is represented by [[Aristophanes]]<ref>Cf. Aristophanes, chiefly ''[[The Knights]]'' (864\u2013867: \"You are like the fishers for eels; in still waters they catch nothing, but if they thoroughly stir up the slime, their fishing is good; in the same way it's only in troublous times that you line your pockets.\", etc.), ''[[The Wasps]]'' (esp. 664\u2013712), and most mentions of Cleon in the other plays.</ref> and [[Thucydides]]<ref>Cf. Thucydides, ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', book III (36: \"the most violent man at Athens\", and 37\u201340 on the Mytilene affair), IV (21: \"a popular leader of the time and very powerful with the multitude\", 22, 27\u201329 on the Pylos affair), and V (16: \"Cleon and Brasidas, who had been the two principal opponents of peace on either side\u2014the latter from the success and honour which war gave him, the former because he thought that, if tranquillity were restored, his crimes would be more open to detection and his slanders less credited\").</ref> in a very unfavourable light. Their portrayals may be justified considering he instilled a feeling of mistrust within Athens through a kind of Athenian \"[[McCarthyism]]\", caused by the excessive number of informants he employed to keep watch on the city. Yet, both have been suspected of being prejudiced witnesses: The playwright Aristophanes had a grudge against Cleon, who may have accused him before the Council of having ridiculed (in his lost play ''Babylonians'') the policy and institutions of his city in the presence of foreigners and at the time of a great national danger. Thucydides, believing in the shortcomings of democratic government,<ref>A.H.M. Jones, \u2018The Athenian democracy and its critics\u2019, ''Cambridge Historical Journey''. 11.1 (1953), 1\u201326.</ref> had also been prosecuted (unjustly, his ships arriving two days after a town was occupied by Spartan forces) for military incapacity and exiled by a decree proposed by Cleon. Indeed, of all the persons who appear in Thucydides' ''History'', Cleon is treated with the least impartiality.<ref>[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.''

IV, p. 495</ref>\n\nHis influence lay in his forceful and bullying style of oratory, anti-intellectual and anti-aristocratic in tone, and his [[populism]]. This might have brought him many enemies.

He was the first prominent representative of the commercial class in Athenian politics, although he was an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] himself. His contemporaries, the historian [[Thucydides]] and the comedic playwright [[Aristophanes]], both represent him as an unscrupulous, warmongering [[demagogue]], but both of them had strong motives to present Cleon unfavorably.\n\n==Public service==\n===Opposition to Pericles===\nCleon first came to notice as an opponent of [[Pericles]] in the late 430s BCE through his opposition to Pericles' strategy of refusing battle against the [[Peloponnesian League]] invaders in 431 BCE.  As a result, he found himself acting in concert with the Athenian aristocratic parties, who also had no liking for Pericles. During 430 BCE, after the unsuccessful expedition by Pericles to the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]], and when the city was devastated by the [[Plague of Athens|plague]], Cleon headed the opposition to Pericles' rule. At this time, Pericles was accused by Cleon of maladministration of public money, with the result of Pericles being found guilty and removed from office.<ref>[[George Grote]]. ''History of Greece'', abridged ed., 1907, p.&nbsp;406, note 1</ref> However, Pericles' setback was temporary and he was soon reinstated.\n\n===Rise in popularity===\nThe death of Pericles from the plague in 429 BCE left the field clear for new leadership in Athens. Hitherto Cleon had only been a vigorous opposition speaker, a trenchant critic and accuser of state officials, but he now came forward as the professed champion and leader of the [[democracy]] and rapidly came to dominate Athenian politics.  Although rough and unpolished, he was charismatic, with natural eloquence and a powerful voice, and he knew how to work upon the emotions of the Athenian populace. He strengthened his support amongst the poorer citizens by increasing the pay for jury work, which provided a livelihood for many of the poorer Athenians.\n\nThe fondness of the Athenians for litigation increased his power; and the practice of \"[[sycophant|sycophancy]]\" (raking up material for false charges) enabled him to remove those who were likely to endanger his ascendancy. In 426 BCE, Cleon brought an unsuccessful prosecution against [[Laches (person)|Laches]] based on his [[Strategos|generalship]] in the unsuccessful first Sicilian expedition.  This is one of the very few times that an Athenian general escaped civil punishment for a defeat.  Having no further use for his former aristocratic associates, he broke off all connection with them, and thus felt at liberty to attack the secret combinations for political purposes, the oligarchical clubs to which they mostly belonged. Whether he also introduced a property-tax for military purposes, and even held a high position connected with the treasury, is uncertain.\n\n===War against Sparta, subsequent death===\nCleon's ruling principles were an inveterate hatred of the nobility, and an equal hatred of Sparta. It was mainly through him that the opportunity of concluding an honourable peace (in 425 BCE) was lost, and in his determination to see [[Sparta]] defeated, often spoke of dazzling future benefits. He insisted upon Athenian security via strategic possession of territories rather than by Spartan goodwill.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Peloponnesian_War.html?id=NSDgGwAACAAJ|title=The Peloponnesian War|last=Kagan|first=Donald|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780142004371|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 427 BCE, Cleon urged his Athenian countrymen to put to death the whole adult male population of [[Mytilene]], which had put itself at the head of a revolt.

[[Jimmy Sangster]] adapted the screenplay from the play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]], which had been [[The Man in Half Moon Street|previously filmed in 1945]]. ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was produced by [[Michael Carreras]] and [[Anthony Nelson Keys]] for [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It was released in the US on 19 August 1959 and in the UK on 30 November 1959.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nParis, 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet (Diffring), MD and sculptor, harbours an unusual secret. Although he appears to be in his mid-30s, he is actually 104-years-old, and has kept his youth and vitality through [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] gland transplants every 10 years. But things are going wrong. Prof Ludwig Weiss ([[Arnold Marl\u00e9]]) of Vienna, co-discoverer of the anti-ageing process, is three weeks late in arriving at Georges' home to perform the latest transplant. As such, Georges must drink a steaming green liquid to stay young. When Georges' latest model, Margo Philippe ([[Delphi Lawrence]]), comes across Georges swilling the fluid, he strikes her down. \n\nGeorges has invited a number of people to a reception at which he will unveil his bust of Margo, including Janine Dubois (Court), his former lover, and Dr Pierre Girard (Lee), Janine's current companion. When the 89-year-old Ludwig later arrives, it is quite apparent he will be unable to operate on Georges because a stroke has incapacitated his right hand. Ludwig tells Georges they must find another surgeon.\n\nGeorges and Ludwig invite Janine and Pierre to dinner. In private, Ludwig convinces Pierre to perform the transplant. However, Janine is still in love with Georges, and when he mysteriously says he must soon leave Paris so he can 'lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond', Janine asks to accompany him. As the dinner party ends, [[National Police (France)|Sur\u00e9t\u00e9]] Inspector LeGris ([[Francis de Wolff|Francis De Wolff]]) arrives. He is investigating Margo's disappearance. Georges denies knowing her whereabouts and, when LeGris asks to see the bust of Margo, he tells him that he accidentally destroyed it. LeGris leaves and Georges admits to his startled guests that he lied but says the police would probably damage the bust if he turned it over to them.\n\nAfter Janine and Pierre have left, Ludwig tells Georges that Pierre will operate. But Ludwig has grown suspicious of Georges and says it is strange that Georges' models have gone missing right after Georges' transplants. Ludwig also tells him that after examining the newest parathyroid gland, he can tell Georges has harvested it from a living person, instead of it being 'revitalised' from a corpse. When Ludwig tells him that his actions are unjustified, Georges says sadly that he's done what he's done because he has been left 'utterly alone - again and again' and is tired of having to start a new life every decade. Georges horrifies Ludwig by saying he wants to end his loneliness by having Janine with him forever. The men argue violently, and Georges strangles Ludwig to death.\n\nPierre arrives the following morning to perform the operation, but Georges tells him that Ludwig was unexpectedly called back to Vienna. Pierre refuses to carry on and suggests that Georges find another surgeon. But Georges can find no one who is willing or able,\n\nLeGris tells Pierre of the disappearances of three young women at 10 year intervals - in London, San Francisco and Bern, Switzerland - and that each modelled for a sculptor who was an MD and who went missing at the same time. With Margo also missing, LeGris believes Georges is responsible for all the disappearances.\n\nGeorges takes Janine to a storeroom which holds his sculptures. He proudly shows her the first figurine he made as a boy. The figurine is dated 1798.  Janine laughingly says the date must be incorrect because if it weren't, Georges would be 104. Georges abruptly leaves, locking Janine in the storeroom.\n\nGeorges tells Pierre that he and Ludwig discovered the secret of 'perpetual life' decades earlier. But he can't reveal the secret to the world because if everyone could live forever, paradoxically, everyone would die as there would be no supply of parathyroid glands to keep them alive. Pierre again refuses to perform the transplant, calling it 'an offence against nature [and] and offence against God'. But he relents when Georges threatens Janine's life.\n\nJanine finds a now-mad Margo imprisoned in the storeroom. Meanwhile, Pierre fakes the operation - making the incision at Georges' waist but not transplanting the gland. Georges rushes to the storeroom, and as Pierre and LeGris follow, Georges tells Janine that the same operation will allow her to live forever, always young and beautiful and in love. She refuses.\n\nSuddenly, Georges begins ageing rapidly and realises that Pierre didn't actually perform the operation. As he exclaims he's dying, Margo, laughing dementedly, throws an oil lamp on him, setting him and the storeroom afire. Pierre and LeGris rescue Janine. Georges and Margo die in the flames. \n\n== Cast ==\n''Credited:''\n\n* [[Anton Diffring]] as Dr. Georges Bonnet\n* [[Hazel Court]] as Janine Dubois\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Dr. Pierre Gerard\n* [[Arnold Marl\u00e9]] as Prof. Ludwig Weiss\n* [[Delphi Lawrence]] as Margo Phillipe\n\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] as Insp.

[[Jimmy Sangster]] adapted the screenplay from the play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barr\u00e9 Lyndon]], which had been [[The Man in Half Moon Street|previously filmed in 1945]]. ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was produced by [[Michael Carreras]] and [[Anthony Nelson Keys]] for [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It was released in the US on 19 August 1959 and in the UK on 30 November 1959.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nParis, 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet (Diffring), MD and sculptor, harbours an unusual secret. Although he appears to be in his mid-30s, he is actually 104-years-old, and has kept his youth and vitality through [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] gland transplants every 10 years. But things are going wrong. Prof Ludwig Weiss ([[Arnold Marl\u00e9]]) of Vienna, co-discoverer of the anti-ageing process, is three weeks late in arriving at Georges' home to perform the latest transplant. As such, Georges must drink a steaming green liquid to stay young. When Georges' latest model, Margo Philippe ([[Delphi Lawrence]]), comes across Georges swilling the fluid, he strikes her down. \n\nGeorges has invited a number of people to a reception at which he will unveil his bust of Margo, including Janine Dubois (Court), his former lover, and Dr Pierre Girard (Lee), Janine's current companion. When the 89-year-old Ludwig later arrives, it is quite apparent he will be unable to operate on Georges because a stroke has incapacitated his right hand. Ludwig tells Georges they must find another surgeon.\n\nGeorges and Ludwig invite Janine and Pierre to dinner. In private, Ludwig convinces Pierre to perform the transplant. However, Janine is still in love with Georges, and when he mysteriously says he must soon leave Paris so he can 'lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond', Janine asks to accompany him. As the dinner party ends, [[National Police (France)|Sur\u00e9t\u00e9]] Inspector LeGris ([[Francis de Wolff|Francis De Wolff]]) arrives. He is investigating Margo's disappearance. Georges denies knowing her whereabouts and, when LeGris asks to see the bust of Margo, he tells him that he accidentally destroyed it. LeGris leaves and Georges admits to his startled guests that he lied but says the police would probably damage the bust if he turned it over to them.\n\nAfter Janine and Pierre have left, Ludwig tells Georges that Pierre will operate. But Ludwig has grown suspicious of Georges and says it is strange that Georges' models have gone missing right after Georges' transplants. Ludwig also tells him that after examining the newest parathyroid gland, he can tell Georges has harvested it from a living person, instead of it being 'revitalised' from a corpse. When Ludwig tells him that his actions are unjustified, Georges says sadly that he's done what he's done because he has been left 'utterly alone - again and again' and is tired of having to start a new life every decade. Georges horrifies Ludwig by saying he wants to end his loneliness by having Janine with him forever. The men argue violently, and Georges strangles Ludwig to death.\n\nPierre arrives the following morning to perform the operation, but Georges tells him that Ludwig was unexpectedly called back to Vienna. Pierre refuses to carry on and suggests that Georges find another surgeon. But Georges can find no one who is willing or able,\n\nLeGris tells Pierre of the disappearances of three young women at 10 year intervals - in London, San Francisco and Bern, Switzerland - and that each modelled for a sculptor who was an MD and who went missing at the same time. With Margo also missing, LeGris believes Georges is responsible for all the disappearances.\n\nGeorges takes Janine to a storeroom which holds his sculptures. He proudly shows her the first figurine he made as a boy. The figurine is dated 1798.  Janine laughingly says the date must be incorrect because if it weren't, Georges would be 104. Georges abruptly leaves, locking Janine in the storeroom.\n\nGeorges tells Pierre that he and Ludwig discovered the secret of 'perpetual life' decades earlier. But he can't reveal the secret to the world because if everyone could live forever, paradoxically, everyone would die as there would be no supply of parathyroid glands to keep them alive. Pierre again refuses to perform the transplant, calling it 'an offence against nature [and] and offence against God'. But he relents when Georges threatens Janine's life.\n\nJanine finds a now-mad Margo imprisoned in the storeroom. Meanwhile, Pierre fakes the operation - making the incision at Georges' waist but not transplanting the gland. Georges rushes to the storeroom, and as Pierre and LeGris follow, Georges tells Janine that the same operation will allow her to live forever, always young and beautiful and in love. She refuses.\n\nSuddenly, Georges begins ageing rapidly and realises that Pierre didn't actually perform the operation. As he exclaims he's dying, Margo, laughing dementedly, throws an oil lamp on him, setting him and the storeroom afire. Pierre and LeGris rescue Janine. Georges and Margo die in the flames. \n\n== Cast ==\n''Credited:''\n\n* [[Anton Diffring]] as Dr. Georges Bonnet\n* [[Hazel Court]] as Janine Dubois\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Dr. Pierre Gerard\n* [[Arnold Marl\u00e9]] as Prof. Ludwig Weiss\n* [[Delphi Lawrence]] as Margo Phillipe\n\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] as Insp.

''LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES''. Bonaventure Press. p.608.</ref> (January 14, 1892 \u2013 November 2, 1992) professionally known as '''Hal Roach''', was an American film and television producer, director, and actor who was active from the 1910s to the 1990s. He is remembered today for producing a number of successes including the [[Laurel and Hardy]] franchise, the film's of entertainer [[Charley Chase]] and ''[[Our Gang]]'' film comedy series.\n\n==Early life and career==\nHal Roach was born in [[Elmira, New York]], to Charles Henry Roach, whose father was born in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], and Mabel Gertrude Bally, her father John Bally being from [[Switzerland]].<ref>[[Randy Skretvedt|Skretvedt, Randy]] (2016). ''LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES''. Bonaventure Press. p.608</ref> A presentation by the great American [[List of humorists|humorist]] [[Mark Twain]] impressed Roach as a young [[Primary education|grade school]] student.\n\nAfter an adventurous youth that took him to [[Alaska]], Hal Roach arrived in [[Hollywood, California]], in 1912 and began working as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] in [[silent film]]s. Upon coming into an inheritance, he began producing [[short film|short film comedies]] in 1915 with his friend [[Harold Lloyd]], who portrayed a character known as Lonesome Luke.\n\nIn September 1916, Roach married actress [[Marguerite Nichols]]. They had two children, [[Hal Roach Jr.|Hal Jr.]] (June 15, 1918 \u2013 March 29, 1972), who followed his father as a producer and director, and Margaret M. Roach (March 15, 1921 \u2013 November 22, 1964), who worked as an actress in the 1930s and 1940s.

During the 1920s and 1930s, he employed Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923), [[Will Rogers]], [[Max Davidson]], the [[Our Gang]] children, [[Charley Chase]], [[Harry Langdon]], [[Thelma Todd]], [[ZaSu Pitts]], [[Lupe V\u00e9lez]], [[Patsy Kelly]] and, most famously, [[Laurel and Hardy]]. During the 1920s, Roach's biggest rival was producer [[Mack Sennett]]. In 1925, Roach hired away Sennett's supervising director, [[F. Richard Jones]].\n\nRoach released his films through [[Path\u00e9 Exchange]] until 1927, when he went to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. He converted his silent movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. In the days before [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], foreign language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in the Spanish, French, and sometimes Italian and German languages. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang children (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue [[phonetically]], often working from blackboards hidden off camera.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn 1931, with the release of the Laurel & Hardy film ''[[Pardon Us]]'', Roach began producing occasional full-length features alongside the short product. Short subjects became less profitable and were phased out by 1936, save for the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series. An ''Our Gang'' feature film ''[[General Spanky]]'' did not do as well as expected; Roach continued making the shorts for MGM.\n\nIn 1937, Roach conceived a joint business venture partnering with [[Vittorio Mussolini]], son of fascist Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], to form a production company called \"R.A.M\" (Roach and Mussolini). Roach claimed the scheme involved Italian bankers (not the government) providing US$6 million that would enable Roach's studio to produce a series of 12 films. Eight would be for Italian screening only whilst the remaining four would receive world distribution.  The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera ''[[Rigoletto]]''.<ref> Graham, Sheila ''Hollywood Today'' ''Hal Roach Defends Mussolini Deal'' p. 4  ''The Milwaukee Journal'' 5 October 1937</ref>\n\nThis proposed business alliance with Mussolini caused MGM to intervene and force Roach to pay his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, coupled with the underperformance of much of Roach's new feature product (save for Laurel & Hardy films and the odd non-L&H hit such as 1937's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]''), led to the end of Roach's relationship with MGM.<ref name=\"MGMsale\">Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). ''A History of Hal Roach Studios''. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press. Pg. 97\u2013102, 116, 225. {{ISBN|0-8093-2637-X}}.</ref> In May 1938, Roach ended his distribution contract with MGM, selling them the production rights to, and actors' contracts for ''Our Gang'' in the process, and signed with [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"MGMsale\" />\n\nFrom 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'', 1937, and ''[[The Housekeeper's Daughter]]'', 1939) or rugged action fare (like ''[[Captain Fury]]'', 1939, and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'', 1940). Roach's one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), in which actors [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] played the leading roles. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio's biggest drawing cards, were now the studio's ''least'' important product and were phased out altogether in 1940.\n\nIn 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length [[featurette]]s, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these \"[[Hal Roach's Streamliners|streamliners]]\", as he called them, would be useful in [[double-feature]] situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him and used Roach's mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach's streamliners through 1943. By this time, Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars and cast his films with familiar featured players ([[William Tracy]] and [[Joe Sawyer]], [[Johnny Downs]], [[Jean Porter (actress)|Jean Porter]], [[Frank Faylen]], [[William Bendix]], [[George E. Stone]], etc.).\n\n==World War II and television==\nHal Roach, Sr., commissioned in the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927<ref> p. 125  Ward, Richard Lewis ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'' SIU Press, 15 Aug 2006</ref> was called back to active military duty in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in June 1942, at age 50.  The studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military [[training film]]s. The studios were leased to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] made 400 training, morale and [[propaganda films]] at \"Fort Roach\". Members of the unit included [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements.<ref name=\"betancourt201203\">{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html | title=World War II: The Movie | work=Air & Space | date=March 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Betancourt, Mark}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star [[Bebe Daniels]] as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in [[Cinecolor]], although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with [[Hal Roach Jr.]], producing series such as ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', ''[[Steve Donovan, Western Marshal]]'', ''[[Racket Squad]]'', ''[[The Public Defender (TV series)|The Public Defender]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]'' and ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[The Life of Riley]]'' and ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.<ref>\"Hollywood Is Humming\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 29, 1951.</ref>\n\nRecognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies were successful in [[television syndication]], as were the ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies produced from 1927-1938, for which in 1949 Roach had bought back the rights from MGM and re-branded for television as \"The Little Rascals\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | title=Little Rascals History | accessdate=2017-02-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119052141/http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | archive-date=November 19, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He thus became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, [[Hal Roach Jr.]], and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961.\n\nFor two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96.\n\nIn 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an [[honorary Academy Award]]. Former ''Our Gang'' members [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[George McFarland|George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional [[Our Gang]] member, [[Ernie Morrison]], was amongst the crowd and started the standing ovation for Hal Roach. Cooper's gratitude towards Roach was especially notable. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in [[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]] when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper's services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week''.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please Don't Shoot My Dog|last=Cooper|first=Jackie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1982|isbn=0-425-05306-7|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9 9, 32, 40\u201342, 44, 54\u201361]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 January 1992, Roach was a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', just days after his 100th birthday, where he recounted experiences with such stars as [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Jean Harlow]]; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance. In February 1992, Roach travelled to [[Berlin]] to receive the honorary award of the ''Berlinale Kamera'' for Lifetime Achievement at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the [[64th Academy Awards]] ceremony, hosted by [[Billy Crystal]]. When Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip \"I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.\"\n\n==Death==\nHal Roach died in his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], from [[pneumonia]], on November 2, 1992, just two months before his 101st birthday. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946).

''LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES''. Bonaventure Press. p.608.</ref> (January 14, 1892 \u2013 November 2, 1992) professionally know as '''Hal Roach''', was an American film and television producer, director, and actor who was active from the 1910s to the 1990s. He is remembered today for producing a number of successes including the [[Laurel and Hardy]] franchise, the film's of entertainer [[Charley Chase]] and ''[[Our Gang]]'' film comedy series.\n\n==Early life and career==\nHal Roach was born in [[Elmira, New York]], to Charles Henry Roach, whose father was born in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], and Mabel Gertrude Bally, her father John Bally being from [[Switzerland]].<ref>[[Randy Skretvedt|Skretvedt, Randy]] (2016).

Upon coming into an inheritance, he began producing [[short film|short film comedies]] in 1915 with his friend [[Harold Lloyd]], who portrayed a character known as Lonesome Luke.\n\nIn September 1916, Roach married actress [[Marguerite Nichols]]. They had two children, [[Hal Roach Jr.|Hal Jr.]] (June 15, 1918 \u2013 March 29, 1972), who followed his father as a producer and director, and Margaret M.

During the 1920s and 1930s, he employed Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923), [[Will Rogers]], [[Max Davidson]], the [[Our Gang]] children, [[Charley Chase]], [[Harry Langdon]], [[Thelma Todd]], [[ZaSu Pitts]], [[Lupe V\u00e9lez]], [[Patsy Kelly]] and, most famously, [[Laurel and Hardy]]. During the 1920s, Roach's biggest rival was producer [[Mack Sennett]]. In 1925, Roach hired away Sennett's supervising director, [[F. Richard Jones]].\n\nRoach released his films through [[Path\u00e9 Exchange]] until 1927, when he went to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. He converted his silent movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. In the days before [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], foreign language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in the Spanish, French, and sometimes Italian and German languages. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang children (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue [[phonetically]], often working from blackboards hidden off camera.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn 1931, with the release of the Laurel & Hardy film ''[[Pardon Us]]'', Roach began producing occasional full-length features alongside the short product. Short subjects became less profitable and were phased out by 1936, save for the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series. An ''Our Gang'' feature film ''[[General Spanky]]'' did not do as well as expected; Roach continued making the shorts for MGM.\n\nIn 1937, Roach conceived a joint business venture partnering with [[Vittorio Mussolini]], son of fascist Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], to form a production company called \"R.A.M\" (Roach and Mussolini). Roach claimed the scheme involved Italian bankers (not the government) providing US$6 million that would enable Roach's studio to produce a series of 12 films. Eight would be for Italian screening only whilst the remaining four would receive world distribution.  The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera ''[[Rigoletto]]''.<ref> Graham, Sheila ''Hollywood Today'' ''Hal Roach Defends Mussolini Deal'' p. 4  ''The Milwaukee Journal'' 5 October 1937</ref>\n\nThis proposed business alliance with Mussolini caused MGM to intervene and force Roach to pay his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, coupled with the underperformance of much of Roach's new feature product (save for Laurel & Hardy films and the odd non-L&H hit such as 1937's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]''), led to the end of Roach's relationship with MGM.<ref name=\"MGMsale\">Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). ''A History of Hal Roach Studios''. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press. Pg. 97\u2013102, 116, 225. {{ISBN|0-8093-2637-X}}.</ref> In May 1938, Roach ended his distribution contract with MGM, selling them the production rights to, and actors' contracts for ''Our Gang'' in the process, and signed with [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"MGMsale\" />\n\nFrom 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'', 1937, and ''[[The Housekeeper's Daughter]]'', 1939) or rugged action fare (like ''[[Captain Fury]]'', 1939, and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'', 1940). Roach's one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), in which actors [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] played the leading roles. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio's biggest drawing cards, were now the studio's ''least'' important product and were phased out altogether in 1940.\n\nIn 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length [[featurette]]s, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these \"[[Hal Roach's Streamliners|streamliners]]\", as he called them, would be useful in [[double-feature]] situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him and used Roach's mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach's streamliners through 1943. By this time, Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars and cast his films with familiar featured players ([[William Tracy]] and [[Joe Sawyer]], [[Johnny Downs]], [[Jean Porter (actress)|Jean Porter]], [[Frank Faylen]], [[William Bendix]], [[George E. Stone]], etc.).\n\n==World War II and television==\nHal Roach, Sr., commissioned in the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927<ref> p. 125  Ward, Richard Lewis ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'' SIU Press, 15 Aug 2006</ref> was called back to active military duty in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in June 1942, at age 50.  The studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military [[training film]]s. The studios were leased to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] made 400 training, morale and [[propaganda films]] at \"Fort Roach\". Members of the unit included [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements.<ref name=\"betancourt201203\">{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html | title=World War II: The Movie | work=Air & Space | date=March 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Betancourt, Mark}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star [[Bebe Daniels]] as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in [[Cinecolor]], although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with [[Hal Roach Jr.]], producing series such as ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', ''[[Steve Donovan, Western Marshal]]'', ''[[Racket Squad]]'', ''[[The Public Defender (TV series)|The Public Defender]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]'' and ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[The Life of Riley]]'' and ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.<ref>\"Hollywood Is Humming\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 29, 1951.</ref>\n\nRecognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies were successful in [[television syndication]], as were the ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies produced from 1927-1938, for which in 1949 Roach had bought back the rights from MGM and re-branded for television as \"The Little Rascals\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | title=Little Rascals History | accessdate=2017-02-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119052141/http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | archive-date=November 19, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He thus became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, [[Hal Roach Jr.]], and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961.\n\nFor two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96.\n\nIn 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an [[honorary Academy Award]]. Former ''Our Gang'' members [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[George McFarland|George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional [[Our Gang]] member, [[Ernie Morrison]], was amongst the crowd and started the standing ovation for Hal Roach. Cooper's gratitude towards Roach was especially notable. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in [[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]] when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper's services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week''.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please Don't Shoot My Dog|last=Cooper|first=Jackie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1982|isbn=0-425-05306-7|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9 9, 32, 40\u201342, 44, 54\u201361]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 January 1992, Roach was a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', just days after his 100th birthday, where he recounted experiences with such stars as [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Jean Harlow]]; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance. In February 1992, Roach travelled to [[Berlin]] to receive the honorary award of the ''Berlinale Kamera'' for Lifetime Achievement at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the [[64th Academy Awards]] ceremony, hosted by [[Billy Crystal]]. When Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip \"I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.\"\n\n==Death==\nHal Roach died in his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], from [[pneumonia]], on November 2, 1992, just two months before his 101st birthday. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946).

Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33\u201334,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nSome writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836\u2013885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D.

Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area. The migrations occurred over several centuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baluchistan-iii |title=BALUCHISTAN iii. Baluchi Language and Literature |author=J.

After this, the Baloch continued their eastward migration towards what is now Balochistan province of Pakistan, although some remained behind and there are still Baloch in eastern part of the Iranian [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan-Baluchestan]] and [[Kerman province|Kerman]] provinces.

Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33\u201334,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nSome writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836\u2013885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D.

Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area.

They usually wear a gold brooch (''tasni'') that is made by local jewellers in different shapes and sizes and is used to fasten the two parts of the dress together over the chest. In ancient times, especially during the pre-Islamic era, it was common for Baloch women to perform [[Persian dance|dances]] and sing [[Balochi music|folk songs]] at different events. The tradition of a Baloch mother singing lullabies to her children has played an important role in the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation since ancient times. Apart from the dressing style of the Baloch, indigenous and local traditions and customs are also of great importance to the Baloch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0;wap2 |title=Baloch Society & culture |publisher=Baask.com |accessdate=7 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045319/http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0%3Bwap2 |archivedate=16 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nBaloch Culture Day is celebrated by the Balochi people annually on 2 March with festivities to celebrate their rich culture and history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/02/baloch-cultural-day-celebrated-with-colourful-functions-gatherings/ |title=Baloch Cultural Day celebrated with colourful functions, gatherings |date=2 March 2018 |website=Pakistan Today |publisher=Pakistan Today |access-date=21 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Baloch tribes==\n{{see also|List of Baloch tribes}}\n[[File:Men in Zaranj-cropped.jpg|thumb|Afghan Baloch men in [[Zaranj]], [[Nimruz Province]]]]\n\n===Tradition===\nTraditionally, [[Jalal Khan]] was the ruler and founder of the first Balochi confederacy in 12th century.

A rare example of the genre [[Korean Fantasy]], the [[stock characters]] and clich\u00e9s of normal western fantasy such as [[elves]], magic, dragons and Latin languages are instead replaced by Korean concepts such as [[dokkaebi]], [[ssirum]], and the [[Arajit]] language, which is based on [[Proto-Korean]].\n\n== Publishing ==\n\nThe novel was first serialized in [[Hitel]], an internet forum site, continuing the tradition that all novels by Lee Yeongdo are first serialized in the internet. After the conclusion of the serial, the book was later published through [[Golden Bough]], a publishing company of [[South Korea]]. Due to its length, the story was published in four hardcover volumes.\n\n*Book 1: ''Nagas Who Extract Their Hearts'' \n*Book 2: ''Lekons Who Pursue Their Desire''\n*Book 3: ''Dokkaebis Who Play Their Fire''\n*Book 4: ''Humans Who Seek Their King''\n\n==Main characters==\n\n; Keigon Draka ({{Korean|hangul=\ucf00\uc774\uac74 \ub4dc\ub77c\uce74|rr=Keigeon deuraka|labels=no}})\n: A mysterious human who hunts and eats nagas. He is chosen as the ''pathfinder'' of the Rescue Party that must rescue a naga and bring the naga to Haensha Archtemple. His name consists of two animals that were made extinct by the naga; his first name 'Kaigon,' means black lion, and his last name Draka, means Dragon.\n\n; Beehyung Srable ({{Korean|hangul=\ube44\ud615 \uc2a4\ub77c\ube14|rr=Bihyeong seurabeul|labels=no}})\n: A cheerful dokkaebi, butler to the lord of Jeumeunnuri (\uc988\ubbc4\ub204\ub9ac). He is chosen as the ''magician'' of the Rescue Party.\n\n; Tinahan ({{Korean|hangul=\ud2f0\ub098\ud55c|rr=Tinahan|labels=no}})\n: An arrogant lekon who dreams of climbing on the back of a Sky Fish. He is chosen as the ''defeater'' of the Rescue Party.\n\n; Ryoon Pei ({{Korean|hangul=\ub95c \ud398\uc774|rr=Ryun pei|labels=no}})\n: A young naga who is haunted by the murder of his father, which he witnessed when he was eleven years old. He is sent on a mission to leave Keyboren and reach Haensha Archtemple, where he must try to save all four races. Because of the death of his father, he fears extracting his heart and ran away from the heart extraction ritual. His name derives from [[hanja]] ''ryoon'' (\u8f2a), which means 'wheel'.\n\n; Samo Pei ({{Korean|hangul=\uc0ac\ubaa8 \ud398\uc774|rr=Samo pei|labels=no}})\n: A female naga renowned for her dancing and swordsmanship. She is also kind to naga males, which is uncommon behavior in naga society. As a result, the Pei family is popular among males, and Samo becomes an object of jealousy among other families. She is the elder sister of Ryoon Pei. When Ryoon is accused of murder, she sets out to assassinate her brother, according to naga tradition. She later becomes the King of the northern army and fights against the Naga's invasion.\n\n== Races ==\n\nThe fictional world of ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' is inhabited by four major intelligent races - Human, [[naga (The Bird Series)|naga]], [[lekon]] and [[dokkaebi (The Bird Series)|dokkaebi]]. Other than the humankind, the races that appear in ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' are in most respects [[Lee Yeongdo]]'s original creations, even though the race of naga and dokkaebi originates from Indian and Korean legends, respectively.\n\nEach race has an individual god, who have their own element that they command. They also gave their respective races a gift.\n\n; Human\n: The God who is Nowhere ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \uc5b4\ub514\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2e0). His element is wind; wind comes and goes, but is never at one place. His gift is ''Naneui'' (\ub098\ub2ac), a human woman who is perceived as beautiful to all four races.\n\n; Naga\n: The Goddess who Leaves No Trail ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \ubc1c\uc790\uad6d \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5ec\uc2e0). Her element is water; water does not leave a trail in its path. Her gift is her name, which the protectors (male naga priests) can use to directly communicate with the goddess.\n\n; [[Dokkaebi (The Bird Series)|Dokkaebi]]\n: The God who Kills Himself ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \uc790\uc2e0\uc744 \uc8fd\uc774\ub294 \uc2e0). His element is fire; fire uses up fuel in order to keep burning, eventually killing itself. His gift is the power to control fire.\n\n; Lekon\n: The Goddess who is Lower Than All ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc774\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc5ec\uc2e0). Her element is earth; the earth is beneath everyone. Her gift is Star-steel (\ubcc4\ucca0), which cannot be broken and never rusts.\n\n== Animals ==\n; [[Dragon]] ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \uc6a9 ''Yong'')\n: Unlike in other fantasy novels, dragons in this world are a plant-like species that propagate with [[spore]]s. When the environment is favorable for the dragon to grow, leaves and flower sprout from the spore while its root develops into a ''Yonggeun'' (Dragon root). Then the root grows into a dragon. Like plants, the growth of a dragon reflects the environment that it is raised in; if it grows with horses, the dragon may become a flying horse. If it grows in the sea, the dragon can develop webbed feet. If necessary, a dragon can become nearly humanoid. It was hunted to extinction by the naga, because dragon can set fire to the forest.\n\n; Black Lion ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ud751\uc0ac\uc790 ''Heuksaja'')\n: They possess fur that emits heat. They were hunted to extinction by the naga, who wished to use their heat-emitting hide as a means to attack the north.\n\n; Sky Fish ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ud558\ub298\uce58 ''Haneulchi'')\n:  Huge flying fish. They carry mysterious ruins on their backs. Beetles seem to fear Sky Fish for some unknown reason.\n\n; Beetle ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ub531\uc815\ubc8c\ub808 ''Ttakjeongbeolle'')\n: Instead of horses, Dokkaebi breed huge flying beetles as a means of transportation. Dokkaebi managed to teach beetles sign language, and beetles use their antennae to communicate with Dokkaebi. They are usually large enough to carry up to two people (one if the person happens to be a Lekon).\n\n; King Eagle ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \uc655\ub3c5\uc218\ub9ac ''Wangdoksuri'')\n: Giant eagles, bigger than alligators\n\n; Big Tiger ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ub300\ud638 ''Daeho'')\n\n== Sequels ==\n\nCurrently, Lee Yeongdo has written only one sequel to ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' which is ''[[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]''. \n\nIt is expected that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels, because of the quote in the series that mentions four birds. In the book there is a riddle about [[Four Bird Brothers|four bird brothers]]. One bird drank water, one drank poison, one drank blood and one drank tears. The riddle asks who of the four birds will die first. This riddle appears repeatedly throughout both ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' and ''[[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]'', and is entwined with many of the themes that run through two series.\n\nBecause of this riddle, many people expect that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels to this Bird series, ''The Bird That Drinks Poison'' and ''The Bird That Drinks Water''. However, Lee Yeongdo has not yet confirmed this rumour and whether he would actually continue to finish all four birds is still unknown.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bird That Drinks Tears}}\n[[Category:South Korean literature]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Works by Lee Yeongdo]]\n[[Category:Novels first published in serial form]]\n", "text_old": "{{unref|date=June 2014}}\n{{infobox Book | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = The Bird That Drinks Tears\n| title_orig    = \ub208\ubb3c\uc744 \ub9c8\uc2dc\ub294 \uc0c8\n| translator    = \n| image         = The Bird That Drinks Tears.jpg\n| image_caption = Cover design for the 4th volume of ''The Bird That Drinks Tears''\n| author        = [[Lee Yeongdo]]\n| illustrator   = \n| cover_artist  = \n| country       = [[South Korea]]\n| language      = [[Korean Language|Korean]]\n| series        = \n| genre         = [[Fantasy novel]]\n| publisher     = [[Golden Bough]]\n| release_date  = 2003\n| english_release_date =\n| media_type    = Print ([[Hardcover|Hardback]], 4 volumes\n| pages         = \n| isbn          = 89-8273-573-9\n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   = [[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]\n}}\n\n \n'''''The Bird That Drinks Tears''''' ({{Korean|hangul=\ub208\ubb3c\uc744 \ub9c8\uc2dc\ub294 \uc0c8|rr=Nunmureul masineun sae}}; abbreviated as {{Korean|hangul=\ub208\ub9c8\uc0c8|rr=Nunmasae|labels=no}}) is a series of [[Korean fantasy]] novels by [[Lee Yeongdo]].

Due to its length, the story was published in four hardcover volumes.\n\n*Book 1: ''Nagas Who Extract Their Hearts'' \n*Book 2: ''Lekons Who Pursue Their Desire''\n*Book 3: ''Dokkaebis Who Play Their Fire''\n*Book 4: ''Humans Who Seek Their King''\n\n==Main characters==\n\n; Keigon Draka ({{Korean|hangul=\ucf00\uc774\uac74 \ub4dc\ub77c\uce74|rr=Keigeon deuraka|labels=no}})\n: A mysterious human who hunts and eats nagas. He is chosen as the ''pathfinder'' of the Rescue Party that must rescue a naga and bring the naga to Haensha Archtemple. His name consists of two animals that were made extinct by the naga; his first name 'Kaigon,' means black lion, and his last name Draka, means Dragon.\n\n; Beehyung Srable ({{Korean|hangul=\ube44\ud615 \uc2a4\ub77c\ube14|rr=Bihyeong seurabeul|labels=no}})\n: A cheerful dokkaebi, the butler of castlemaster. He is chosen as the ''magician'' of the Rescue Party.\n\n; Tinahan ({{Korean|hangul=\ud2f0\ub098\ud55c|rr=Tinahan|labels=no}})\n: An arrogant lekon who dreams of climbing on the back of a Sky Fish. He is chosen as the ''defeater'' of the Rescue Party.\n\n; Ryoon Pei ({{Korean|hangul=\ub95c \ud398\uc774|rr=Ryun pei|labels=no}})\n: A young naga who is haunted by the murder of his father, which he witnessed when he was eleven years old. He is sent on a mission to leave Keyboren and reach Haensha Archtemple, where he must try to save all four races. Because of the death of his father, he fears extracting his heart and ran away from the heart extraction ritual. His name derives from [[hanja]] ''ryoon'' (\u8f2a), which means 'wheel'.\n\n; Samo Pei ({{Korean|hangul=\uc0ac\ubaa8 \ud398\uc774|rr=Samo pei|labels=no}})\n: A female naga renowned for her dancing and swordsmanship. She is also kind to naga males, which is uncommon behavior in naga society. As a result, the Pei family is popular among males, and Samo becomes an object of jealousy among other families. She is the elder sister of Ryoon Pei. When Ryoon is accused of murder, she sets out to assassinate her brother, according to naga tradition. She later becomes the King of the northern army and fights against the Naga's invasion.\n\n== Races ==\n\nThe fictional world of ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' is inhabited by four major intelligent races - Human, [[naga (The Bird Series)|naga]], [[lekon]] and [[dokkaebi (The Bird Series)|dokkaebi]]. Other than the humankind, the races that appear in ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' are in most respects [[Lee Yeongdo]]'s original creations, even though the race of naga and dokkaebi originates from Indian and Korean legends, respectively.\n\nEach race has an individual god, who have their own element that they command. They also gave their respective races a gift.\n\n; Human\n: The God who is Nowhere ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \uc5b4\ub514\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2e0). His element is wind; wind comes and goes, but is never at one place. His gift is ''Naneui'' (\ub098\ub2ac), a human woman who is perceived as beautiful to all four races.\n\n; Naga\n: The Goddess who Leaves No Trail ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \ubc1c\uc790\uad6d \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5ec\uc2e0). Her element is water; water does not leave a trail in its path. Her gift is her name, which the protectors (male naga priests) can use to directly communicate with the goddess.\n\n; [[Dokkaebi (The Bird Series)|Dokkaebi]]\n: The God who Kills Himself ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \uc790\uc2e0\uc744 \uc8fd\uc774\ub294 \uc2e0). His element is fire; fire uses up fuel in order to keep burning, eventually killing itself. His gift is the power to control fire.\n\n; Lekon\n: The Goddess who is Lower Than All ([[Korean_language|Korean]]: \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc774\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc5ec\uc2e0). Her element is earth; the earth is beneath everyone. Her gift is Star-steel (\ubcc4\ucca0), which cannot be broken and never rusts.\n\n== Animals ==\n; [[Dragon]] ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \uc6a9 ''Yong'')\n: Unlike in other fantasy novels, dragons in this world are a plant-like species that propagate with [[spore]]s. When the environment is favorable for the dragon to grow, leaves and flower sprout from the spore while its root develops into a ''Yonggeun'' (Dragon root). Then the root grows into a dragon. Like plants, the growth of a dragon reflects the environment that it is raised in; if it grows with horses, the dragon may become a flying horse. If it grows in the sea, the dragon can develop webbed feet. If necessary, a dragon can become nearly humanoid. It was hunted to extinction by the naga, because dragon can set fire to the forest.\n\n; Black Lion ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ud751\uc0ac\uc790 ''Heuksaja'')\n: They possess fur that emits heat. They were hunted to extinction by the naga, who wished to use their heat-emitting hide as a means to attack the north.\n\n; Sky Fish ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ud558\ub298\uce58 ''Haneulchi'')\n:  Huge flying fish. They carry mysterious ruins on their backs. Beetles seem to fear Sky Fish for some unknown reason.\n\n; Beetle ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ub531\uc815\ubc8c\ub808 ''Ttakjeongbeolle'')\n: Instead of horses, Dokkaebi breed huge flying beetles as a means of transportation. Dokkaebi managed to teach beetles sign language, and beetles use their antennae to communicate with Dokkaebi. They are usually large enough to carry up to two people (one if the person happens to be a Lekon).\n\n; King Eagle ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \uc655\ub3c5\uc218\ub9ac ''Wangdoksuri'')\n: Giant eagles, bigger than alligators\n\n; Big Tiger ([[Korean_language|Korean]]; \ub300\ud638 ''Daeho'')\n\n== Sequels ==\n\nCurrently, Lee Yeongdo has written only one sequel to ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' which is ''[[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]''. \n\nIt is expected that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels, because of the quote in the series that mentions four birds. In the book there is a riddle about [[Four Bird Brothers|four bird brothers]]. One bird drank water, one drank poison, one drank blood and one drank tears. The riddle asks who of the four birds will die first. This riddle appears repeatedly throughout both ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' and ''[[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]'', and is entwined with many of the themes that run through two series.\n\nBecause of this riddle, many people expect that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels to this Bird series, ''The Bird That Drinks Poison'' and ''The Bird That Drinks Water''. However, Lee Yeongdo has not yet confirmed this rumour and whether he would actually continue to finish all four birds is still unknown.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bird That Drinks Tears}}\n[[Category:South Korean literature]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Works by Lee Yeongdo]]\n[[Category:Novels first published in serial form]]\n", "name_user": "Linguoboy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMain characters", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bird_That_Drinks_Tears"}
