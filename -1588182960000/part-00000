The female's body is 14\u201316&nbsp;mm (1/2 in) in length and is black, often with an [[hourglass]]-shaped red mark on the lower abdomen. This \"hourglass\" mark can be yellow, and on rare occasions, white. The male of the species is around half this length and generally a tan color with lighter striping on the abdomen. The population was previously described as a subspecies of ''[[Latrodectus mactans]]'' and it is closely related to the northern species ''[[Latrodectus variolus]]''. The species, as with others of the genus, build irregular or \"messy\" webs: Unlike the spiral webs or the tunnel-shaped webs of other spiders, the strands of a ''Latrodectus'' web have no apparent organization.\n\nFemale black widows have potent venom containing a neurotoxin active against a range of mammals. (See [[latrodectism]].) Symptoms are pain, nausea, goosebumps, and localized sweating. In historical literature, fatalities were reported at anywhere between 0.5% and 12%<ref>Bettini, S. (1964). Epidemiology of latrodectism. Toxicon, 2(2), 93\u2013102</ref>, but studies within the past several decades have been unable to confirm any fatalities from this or any of the other U.S. species of ''Latrodectus'' (e.g. zero fatalities among 23,409 documented ''Latrodectus'' bites from 2000 through 2008).<ref>Monte AA, Bucher-Bartelson B, Heard KJ (2011) A US perspective of symptomatic ''Latrodectus'' spp. envenomation and treatment: a National Poison Data System review.

He meets up with the widow of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann, who has been killed by [[the Mafia]] while driving a [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the [[Italian Alps]]. Mrs Beckermann gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the hostile attention of his killers, which details a way to steal $4 million in gold in the city of [[Turin]] and escape to [[Switzerland]].\n\nCroker breaks back into his former prison to convince the powerful crime lord Mr. Bridger, who is intensely nationalistic, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns that [[Fiat]] is set to build a new factory in [[China]].\n\nWith Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer that controls Turin's [[Advanced Traffic Management System|traffic control system]], creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three [[Mini Cooper S]] getaway cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theitalianjob.com/cars_coopers.htm|title=Cars \u2013 Mini Coopers|work=The Italian Job.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter planning and training, Croker, his girlfriend Lorna, and the heist crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia are aware of the gang's intentions and smashes their getaway cars (two [[Jaguar E-Type]] and an [[Aston Martin DB4]] drophead) off a cliff. Just as Altabani is about to give the order to shoot the gang, Croker tells him that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by driving Italian merchants in selected British cities out of business. Not wanting to risk suffering on any fellow Italians, Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England and believing that it is too big a job for Croker to undertake. Instead, Croker proceeds with the plan, replacing the traffic control system's [[magnetic tape data storage]] reels. On the day of the robbery, Croker sends gang member Birkinshaw, disguised as a football fan, to jam the [[closed circuit television]] cameras that monitor traffic. The substitute data reel then causes widespread traffic chaos. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, and tow the armoured car into the entrance hall of the [[Museo Egizio]]. There, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis.\n\nAltabani recognises that \"If they planned this jam, they must have planned a way out.\" Pursued by the Turin police, the three Minis race through the shopping arcades of the city, speed down stairs, jump between rooftops, and finally escape the traffic jams by a pre-planned route across a [[weir]]. The getaway is timed perfectly, and they throw off the police by driving through a large sewer pipe. As Mr. Bridger receives the cheers and adulation of his fellow prison inmates, the gang drive the Minis into the back of a moving customised coach. They then unload the gold and dispose of the Minis by pushing them off the mountainside.\n\nThe rest of the gang, having sneaked out of the city in a minibus while disguised as football supporters, rendezvous with the coach in the Alps. On the looping mountain roads, driver \"Big\" William loses control of the coach. The back of the bus is left teetering over a cliff and the gold slides towards the rear doors. As Croker attempts to reach the gold, it slips further. The film finishes on a literal [[cliffhanger]] with Croker announcing:  \"Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Mark |title=Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea!\u2019 Brexit, crisis management and sensemaking |url=http://theconversation.com/hang-on-a-minute-lads-ive-got-a-great-idea-brexit-crisis-management-and-sensemaking-94433 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}} <!-- Please check that any new links are correct or satisfy [[WP:REDLINK]] -->\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Michael Caine]] as Charlie Croker\n*[[No\u00ebl Coward]] as Mr. Bridger\n*[[Benny Hill]] as Professor Simon Peach\n*[[Raf Vallone]] as Altabani\n*[[Tony Beckley]] as Camp Freddie\n*[[Rossano Brazzi]] as Roger Beckermann\n*[[Maggie Blye]] as Lorna\n*[[Irene Handl]] as Miss Peach\n*[[John Le Mesurier]] as the Prison Governor\n*[[Fred Emney]] as Birkinshaw\n*[[John Clive]] as Garage manager\n*[[Graham Payn]] as Keats\n*[[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]] as Arthur\n*[[Stanley Caine]] as Coco\n*[[Barry Cox (actor)|Barry Cox]] as Chris <!-- NOT the [[Barry Cox]] (born 1977) -->\n*[[Harry Baird (actor)|Harry Baird]] as Big William\n*[[George Innes]] as Bill Bailey\n*[[John Forgeham]] as Frank\n*[[Robert Powell]] as Yellow\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Derek Ware (actor)|Derek Ware]] as Rozzer\n*[[Frank Jarvis (actor)|Frank Jarvis]] as Roger\n*[[David Salamone]] as Dominic\n*[[Richard Essame]] as Tony\n*[[Mario Valgoi]] as Manzo\n*[[Renato Romano]]<sup>([[:it:Renato Romano|in Italian]])</sup> as Cosca\n*[[Franco Norvelli]] as Altabani's driver\n*[[Robert Rietti]] as Police chief\n*[[Timothy Bateson]] as Dentist\n*[[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Vicar\n*[[Arnold Diamond]] as Senior computer room official\n*[[Simon Dee]] as Shirtmaker\n*[[Alistair Hunter]] as Warder (cinema)\n*[[Lana Gatto]] as Mrs. Cosca\n*John Morris as Standin <!-- NOT the [[John Morris (actor)]] (born 1984) -->\n*[[Louis Mansi]] as Computer room official\n*[[Henry McGee]] as Tailor\n*[[Lelia Goldoni]] as Mrs Beckermann\n*[[Valerie Leon]] as Hotel Receptionist\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[No\u00ebl Coward]], who played Bridger, was godfather of the director, Peter Collinson.

The documentary describes how [[helicopter]]s would save the bus seen on the cliff at the end of the first film. The grateful gang would soon discover that it is the Mafia that has saved them, and the sequel would have been about stealing the gold bullion back from them.\n\nIn interviews in 2003 and 2008, Michael Caine revealed that the ending would have had Croker \"crawl up, switch on the engine and stay there for four hours until all the [[petrol]] runs out...

The property was later seen in films such as ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973), ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sweeney!]]'' (1977). \n\nThe training sessions shown for the Mini drivers were at the [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]] race track in [[Upper Norwood]], South London. The attempt to blow the doors off the bullion van, which led to its destruction and Croker's famous line, took place at Crystal Palace Sports Centre. The [[Crystal Palace transmitting station|Crystal Palace transmitter]] can be seen in the background. The meeting at the misty funeral was filmed in [[Cruagh]] Cemetery, in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. The [[office block]] that doubled as the Turin traffic control centre was Apex House, the [[Hanworth]], [[Middlesex]] head office of the television rental chain [[Radio Rentals|DER]].<ref name = \"makingof\" />\n\n[[File:1960 Morris Mini - The Italian Job - Coventry Transport Museum.jpg|thumb|right|A display of a Mini emerging from a sewer tunnel in [[Coventry Transport Museum]]]]\n\nThe chase sequences were filmed in Turin, except for the chase through the sewer tunnel, which was shot in the [[River Sowe|Sowe]] Valley Sewer Duplication system in the [[Stoke Aldermoor]] district of [[Coventry]] in the English Midlands, filmed from the back of a [[Mini Moke]].<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The person on the far side who closes the gate at the end of sewer tunnel is the director, Peter Collinson. Collinson also appeared in the scene on the highway when the ramps get jettisoned, clinging to the right-hand rear door of the coach as the Minis enter at speed.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nDuring the getaway the Minis are pursued by police on the rooftop of the [[Torino Palavela|Palavela]], and later on the rooftop test track of what was then a Fiat factory in the [[Lingotto]] building in Turin. The weir the Minis cross in the car chase is just down river from the Ponte Vittorio Emanuele I at the end of [[Po (river)|Via Po]] in central Turin.\n\nA portion of the car chase was filmed as a dance between the Minis and police cars with a full orchestra playing \"[[The Blue Danube]]\" inside [[Pier Luigi Nervi]]'s Palazzo Esposizioni usually used for the Turin Motor Show (now the hospital library).<ref name = \"makingof\" /> It was cut from the final version and appears as an extra on the [[DVD]].\n\nThe final escape from Turin was filmed on the road to [[Ceresole Reale]] via [[Lago Agnel]] and [[Nivolet Pass]] (the highway does not lead to France or Switzerland because it is a dead end). The bus was left hanging off this corner<ref>https://goo.gl/maps/sNCidc999BQ2</ref> in the climactic ending.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[File:The Italian Job - geograph.org.uk - 953936.jpg|thumb|right|Minis on display at Bardney Heritage Centre]]\nRoger Beckermann's orange [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the opening scene is actually two cars. The first was a Miura P400 that was sold as new afterwards. In 2015 it was unearthed and authenticated by Iain Tyrrell, one of the world's foremost classic car experts and Lamborghini aficionado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | title = iaintyrrell.co.uk/media | accessdate = 8 Jan 2018}}</ref> The second car, tumbled down the chasm by the Mafia bulldozer, was another Miura that had previously been in a serious accident and was not roadworthy. Lamborghini confirmed in May 2019 that the Italian Job Miura had been confirmed as chassis number 3586.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/classic-cars/italian-jobs-lost-lamborghini-miura-found/|title=The Italian Job's lost Lamborghini Miura has been found|date=2019-05-08|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the director's commentary on the DVD, despite the publicity the film would give to the Mini, the car's maker, [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]], only provided a token fleet of Minis and the production company had to buy the rest at trade price. [[Fiat]] offered the production as many super-charged Fiat cars as they needed, several sports cars for the Mafia confrontation scene, plus $40,000, but the producers turned down the offer because it would have meant replacing the Minis with Fiats.\n\nThe Minis seen on screen carry registration numbers HMP 729G (Red), GPF 146G (White) and LGW 809G (Blue). As at July 2012, a [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]] query indicates that two of these plates may still be registered; these, however, are not the cars used in the film as the film cars had \"future dated\" plates to make them current with the release date of the film, and as such would not be road legal. There were also numerous detail differences between the Minis used during filming and the launch of the \"G\" year suffix. According to the \"making of\" DVD extra, the Minis used in the chase scenes were all destroyed in accidents while filming the sewer sequence.\n\nAs Croker walks through the garage where the Minis are being prepared, viewers hear that \"Rozzer's having trouble with his differential\", and the back of the red Mini Cooper is jacked up where Rozzer is working. This is an inside joke since the Mini has front-wheel drive and does not have a rear differential. In the early 1960s, front-wheel-drive cars were new and asking a car mechanic to repair a Mini's rear differential was a popular [[snipe hunt]].\n\nGold cost $38.69 per [[troy ounce]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html | title = Hisotical Gold Charts and Data | publisher=Kitco | accessdate = 29 May 2006 }}</ref> so four million dollars in gold bars would have weighed about 3200&nbsp;kg (7000&nbsp;lb), requiring each of the three Minis to carry about 1070&nbsp;kg (2300&nbsp;lb) in addition to the driver and passenger. Since a 1968 Mini only weighs 630&nbsp;kg (1400&nbsp;lb),<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Chris|title=Complete Classic Mini 1959\u20132000|isbn=9781899870608|year=2003|publisher=Motor Racing Publications|location=Croydon}}</ref> each of these vehicles would have had to carry 1\u00bd times its own weight in gold.\n\nThe coach at the end of the film was a 1964 [[Bedford VAL]] with [[Harrington Legionnaire]] Body, distinctive for its twin front steering axles. After its use in the film, the coach returned to commercial service. It was scrapped about 1990 after being in service with several operators, mainly in the Scotland area. The coach had to be reinforced behind the driver's seat so that when the Coopers came into the back they didn't crush the driver. Even though plating had been secured, the driver's seat was still pushed forward several inches, enough for the driver to be touching the steering wheel with his stomach.\n\nWhen the Legionnaire was on its way to Turin, it has London-Turin on the destination display above the windscreen; on the way back it had been changed to Turin-London. It also proudly displayed 'Charlie Croker's Coach Tours' logos on the rear and both flanks. Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped. However, a replica can be found on the roadside at New Invention, Willenhall, West Midlands.\n\nCharlie Croker picks up his [[Aston Martin DB4]] convertible from a garage after release from prison. The scene was mostly improvised, which caused visible lighting irregularities since the crew did not know where the actors would be. The location of the underground carpark and lift is now part of Park Lane BMW, London.\n\nThe original DB4 belongs today to a private English collection. According to several sources, the \"Aston\" pushed off the cliff was a [[Vignale]] [[Lancia Flaminia]] mocked up as an Aston. The two [[Jaguar E-Type|E-type Jaguars]] that suffered from the Mafia's revenge were restored to original condition, the red one of which, 848 CRY, is owned by Phillip Porter, the founder of the Jaguar E-type club.\n\nThe black [[Fiat Dino]] coup\u00e9 of Mafia boss Altabani was bought by Peter Collinson but became so rusty that only its doors remain. The [[Italy|Italian]] police cars seen around [[Turin]] were [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]s. The Italian police armoured car which escorts the gold convoy is a conversion of a former Second World War American [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car. The original 37mm gun was removed and replaced with a water cannon.\n\nA [[Land Rover Series]] IIa Station Wagon, registration BKO 686C, was used to get to the convoy before attacking and was modified with window bars and a [[towbar]]. A [[Ford Thames 400E]] van was used for the football fans' decorated van; this was referred to as the [[Dormobile]], the name of a common [[camper-van]] conversion [[coachbuilder]]. The cross-Channel ferry featured in one scene is the [[MS Free Enterprise I|MS ''Free Enterprise I'']]. The ship spent many years as a day cruise ship in Greek waters before being scrapped in 2013. The \"Chinese\" plane delivering the gold to Turin is a rare [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]], of which only 14 were built and only four passed into private ownership. It had been abandoned in Milan by its owners and was moved to Turin for filming. It was destroyed by fire in 1970.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite web|url=http://cgibin.rcn.com/jeremy.k/cgi-bin/gzUsafSearch.pl?target=&content=Globemaster |title=USAF Serial Number Search Results|accessdate=26 November 2010|work=Aircraft Serial Number Search|first=Jeremy|last=Kuris|date=25 March 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Italian Job (soundtrack)}}\n{{Listen|filename=Matt Monro - On Days Like These excerpt.ogg|title=Matt Monro \u2013 On Days Like These excerpt|description=An excerpt from Matt Monro's ''On Days Like These''}}\nThe music for the soundtrack was written by [[Quincy Jones]].

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval rating of 83% and an average rating of 7.4/10, based on 27 reviews.

He complimented the film's technological sophistication, only criticising what he saw as an 'emotionally retarded' plot. Canby also expressed concern that Coward's appearance in the film, although intended to be kind, 'exploits him in vaguely unpleasant ways' by surrounding his character with images of the royal family, which had not knighted him at the time. A contemporary review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine felt that the film spent too much time focusing on the film's caper as opposed to building the characters; it also criticised the car chases as 'dull and deafening'.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901493,00.html | title = Cinema: Britannia Waives the Rules | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 16 October 2011 | date=19 September 1969}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was the 14th most popular at the UK box office in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World's Top Twenty Films |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=27 September 1970 |via=The Sunday Times Digital Archive }}</ref> Although it received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Best English-Language Foreign Film\", the film was not a success in the US. The film remains popular, however. James Travers of Films de France believes that the film's enduring appeal rests in the 'improbable union' of Michael Caine, No\u00ebl Coward and [[Benny Hill]], whom he considers \"three of the best known [British] performers... in the late 1960s\". He states that the film has a [[cult following|cult status]] and stands as a 'classic of its genre'.<ref name=\"france\"/>\n\nA [[novelisation]] of the film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin and Ken Wlaschin, was published by [[Sphere Books]] in 1969. The book contains numerous differences to the film: for example there is a rival group of German gangsters called the Hamburg Syndicate who try to obtain Beckerman's plans for the robbery, Croker and the three minis travel to Italy by yacht, and Professor Peach is rescued by the gang after he is arrested. The ending of the novel is also significantly different. The bus successfully crosses the border into Switzerland and two days later the gang and the gold arrive on a beach near Dover in a landing craft where they are met by Mr. Bridger and Luigi Altabani. Mr. Bridger tells Charlie Croker that they have come to an agreement to \"divide Europe\" and that the gold must be given back to the Italians.\n\nSince 2000, there have been two remakes of the film. The first was released in 2003 and also called ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'', set in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker. It features [[Donald Sutherland]] as John Bridger, played as more of a father figure to Croker. It employs the updated [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] for a chase towards the end. An official [[Bollywood]] remake of the 2003 film, called ''[[Players (2012 film)|Players]]'', was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=India to Remake 'The Italian Job'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-remake-italian-job-48404|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=11 July 2018|first=Nyay|last=Bhushan|date=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game]] based on the 1969 film, released for the [[PlayStation]] [[Video game console|game console]] in 2001 and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002 and published by [[Rockstar Games]].

He meets up with the widow of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann, who has been killed by [[the Mafia]] while driving a [[Lamborghini Miura]] in the [[Italian Alps]]. Mrs Beckermann gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the hostile attention of his killers, which details a way to steal $4 million in gold in the city of [[Turin]] and escape to [[Switzerland]].\n\nCroker breaks back into his former prison to convince the powerful crime lord Mr. Bridger, who is intensely nationalistic, to finance the plan. Bridger, who has bribed almost all of the prison guards to work for him, initially rejects the plan, but changes his mind after he learns that [[Fiat]] is set to build a new factory in [[China]].\n\nWith Bridger's backing, Croker recruits computer expert Professor Peach and a team of thieves and drivers. The plan calls for Peach to replace the programme in the computer that controls Turin's [[Advanced Traffic Management System|traffic control system]], creating a paralysing traffic jam that will allow the thieves to escape with the gold in three [[Mini Cooper S]] getaway cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theitalianjob.com/cars_coopers.htm|title=Cars \u2013 Mini Coopers|work=The Italian Job.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter planning and training, Croker, his girlfriend Lorna, and the heist crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani and his underlings are waiting in the Alps at the same pass where they killed Beckermann. Altabani warns Croker that the Mafia are aware of the gang's intentions and smashes their getaway cars (two [[Jaguar E-Type]] and an [[Aston Martin DB4]] drophead) off a cliff. Just as Altabani is about to give the order to shoot the gang, Croker tells him that Mr. Bridger will avenge their deaths by driving Italian merchants in selected British cities out of business. Not wanting to risk suffering on any fellow Italians, Altabani lets them go, ordering them to return to England and believing that it is too big a job for Croker to undertake. Instead, Croker proceeds with the plan, replacing the traffic control system's [[magnetic tape data storage]] reels. On the day of the robbery, Croker sends gang member Birkinshaw, disguised as a football fan, to jam the [[closed circuit television]] cameras that monitor traffic. The substitute data reel then causes widespread traffic chaos. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, and tow the armoured car into the entrance hall of the [[Museo Egizio]]. There, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis.\n\nAltabani recognises that \"If they planned this jam, they must have planned a way out.\" Pursued by the Turin police, the three Minis race through the shopping arcades of the city, speed down stairs, jump between rooftops, and finally escape the traffic jams by a pre-planned route across a [[weir]]. The getaway is timed perfectly, and they throw off the police by driving through a large sewer pipe. As Mr. Bridger receives the cheers and adulation of his fellow prison inmates, the gang drive the Minis into the back of a moving customised coach. They then unload the gold and dispose of the Minis by pushing them off the mountainside.\n\nThe rest of the gang, having sneaked out of the city in a minibus while disguised as football supporters, rendezvous with the coach in the Alps. On the looping mountain roads, driver \"Big\" William loses control of the coach. The back of the bus is left teetering over a cliff and the gold slides towards the rear doors. As Croker attempts to reach the gold, it slips further. The film finishes on a literal [[cliffhanger]] with Croker announcing:  \"Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Mark |title=Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea!\u2019 Brexit, crisis management and sensemaking |url=http://theconversation.com/hang-on-a-minute-lads-ive-got-a-great-idea-brexit-crisis-management-and-sensemaking-94433 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}} <!-- Please check that any new links are correct or satisfy [[WP:REDLINK]] -->\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Michael Caine]] as Charlie Croker\n*[[No\u00ebl Coward]] as Mr. Bridger\n*[[Benny Hill]] as Professor Simon Peach\n*[[Raf Vallone]] as Altabani\n*[[Tony Beckley]] as Camp Freddie\n*[[Rossano Brazzi]] as Roger Beckermann\n*[[Maggie Blye]] as Lorna\n*[[Irene Handl]] as Miss Peach\n*[[John Le Mesurier]] as the Prison Governor\n*[[Fred Emney]] as Birkinshaw\n*[[John Clive]] as Garage manager\n*[[Graham Payn]] as Keats\n*[[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]] as Arthur\n*[[Stanley Caine]] as Coco\n*[[Barry Cox (actor)|Barry Cox]] as Chris <!-- NOT the [[Barry Cox]] (born 1977) -->\n*[[Harry Baird (actor)|Harry Baird]] as Big William\n*[[George Innes]] as Bill Bailey\n*[[John Forgeham]] as Frank\n*[[Robert Powell]] as Yellow\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Derek Ware (actor)|Derek Ware]] as Rozzer\n*[[Frank Jarvis (actor)|Frank Jarvis]] as Roger\n*[[David Salamone]] as Dominic\n*[[Richard Essame]] as Tony\n*[[Mario Valgoi]] as Manzo\n*[[Renato Romano]]<sup>([[:it:Renato Romano|in Italian]])</sup> as Cosca\n*[[Franco Norvelli]] as Altabani's driver\n*[[Robert Rietti]] as Police chief\n*[[Timothy Bateson]] as Dentist\n*[[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Vicar\n*[[Arnold Diamond]] as Senior computer room official\n*[[Simon Dee]] as Shirtmaker\n*[[Alistair Hunter]] as Warder (cinema)\n*[[Lana Gatto]] as Mrs. Cosca\n*John Morris as Standin <!-- NOT the [[John Morris (actor)]] (born 1984) -->\n*[[Louis Mansi]] as Computer room official\n*[[Henry McGee]] as Tailor\n*[[Lelia Goldoni]] as Mrs Beckermann\n*[[Valerie Leon]] as Hotel Receptionist\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[No\u00ebl Coward]], who played Bridger, was godfather of the director, Peter Collinson.

The property was later seen in films such as ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'' (1973), ''[[A Touch of Class (film)|A Touch of Class]]'' (1973), and ''[[Sweeney!]]'' (1977). \n\nThe training sessions shown for the Mini drivers were at the [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]] race track in [[Upper Norwood]], South London. The attempt to blow the doors off the bullion van, which led to its destruction and Croker's famous line, took place at Crystal Palace Sports Centre.

Lamborghini confirmed in May 2019 that the Italian Job Miura had been confirmed as chassis number 3586.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/classic-cars/italian-jobs-lost-lamborghini-miura-found/|title=The Italian Job's lost Lamborghini Miura has been found|date=2019-05-08|website=Sunday Times Driving|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the director's commentary on the DVD, despite the publicity the film would give to the Mini, the car's maker, [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]], only provided a token fleet of Minis and the production company had to buy the rest at trade price. [[Fiat]] offered the production as many super-charged Fiat cars as they needed, several sports cars for the Mafia confrontation scene, plus $40,000, but the producers turned down the offer because it would have meant replacing the Minis with Fiats.\n\nThe Minis seen on screen carry registration numbers HMP 729G (Red), GPF 146G (White) and LGW 809G (Blue). As at July 2012, a [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency|DVLA]] query indicates that two of these plates may still be registered; these, however, are not the cars used in the film as the film cars had \"future dated\" plates to make them current with the release date of the film, and as such would not be road legal. There were also numerous detail differences between the Minis used during filming and the launch of the \"G\" year suffix. According to the \"making of\" DVD extra, the Minis used in the chase scenes were all destroyed in accidents while filming the sewer sequence.\n\nAs Croker walks through the garage where the Minis are being prepared, viewers hear that \"Rozzer's having trouble with his differential\", and the back of the red Mini Cooper is jacked up where Rozzer is working. This is an inside joke since the Mini has front-wheel drive and does not have a rear differential. In the early 1960s, front-wheel-drive cars were new and asking a car mechanic to repair a Mini's rear differential was a popular [[snipe hunt]].\n\nGold cost $38.69 per [[troy ounce]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kitco.com/charts/historicalgold.html | title = Hisotical Gold Charts and Data | publisher=Kitco | accessdate = 29 May 2006 }}</ref> so four million dollars in gold bars would have weighed about 3200&nbsp;kg (7000&nbsp;lb), requiring each of the three Minis to carry about 1070&nbsp;kg (2300&nbsp;lb) in addition to the driver and passenger. Since a 1968 Mini only weighs 630&nbsp;kg (1400&nbsp;lb),<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Chris|title=Complete Classic Mini 1959\u20132000|isbn=9781899870608|year=2003|publisher=Motor Racing Publications|location=Croydon}}</ref> each of these vehicles would have had to carry 1\u00bd times its own weight in gold.\n\nThe coach at the end of the film was a 1964 [[Bedford VAL]] with [[Harrington Legionnaire]] Body, distinctive for its twin front steering axles. After its use in the film, the coach returned to commercial service. It was scrapped about 1990 after being in service with several operators, mainly in the Scotland area. The coach had to be reinforced behind the driver's seat so that when the Coopers came into the back they didn't crush the driver. Even though plating had been secured, the driver's seat was still pushed forward several inches, enough for the driver to be touching the steering wheel with his stomach.\n\nWhen the Legionnaire was on its way to Turin, it has London-Turin on the destination display above the windscreen; on the way back it had been changed to Turin-London. It also proudly displayed 'Charlie Croker's Coach Tours' logos on the rear and both flanks. Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped. However, a replica can be found on the roadside at New Invention, Willenhall, West Midlands.\n\nCharlie Croker picks up his [[Aston Martin DB4]] convertible from a garage after release from prison. The scene was mostly improvised, which caused visible lighting irregularities since the crew did not know where the actors would be. The location of the underground carpark and lift is now part of Park Lane BMW, London.\n\nThe original DB4 belongs today to a private English collection. According to several sources, the \"Aston\" pushed off the cliff was a [[Vignale]] [[Lancia Flaminia]] mocked up as an Aston. The two [[Jaguar E-Type|E-type Jaguars]] that suffered from the Mafia's revenge were restored to original condition, the red one of which, 848 CRY, is owned by Phillip Porter, the founder of the Jaguar E-type club.\n\nThe black [[Fiat Dino]] coup\u00e9 of Mafia boss Altabani was bought by Peter Collinson but became so rusty that only its doors remain. The [[Italy|Italian]] police cars seen around [[Turin]] were [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]s. The Italian police armoured car which escorts the gold convoy is a conversion of a former Second World War American [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured car. The original 37mm gun was removed and replaced with a water cannon.\n\nA [[Land Rover Series]] IIa Station Wagon, registration BKO 686C, was used to get to the convoy before attacking and was modified with window bars and a [[towbar]]. A [[Ford Thames 400E]] van was used for the football fans' decorated van; this was referred to as the [[Dormobile]], the name of a common [[camper-van]] conversion [[coachbuilder]]. The cross-Channel ferry featured in one scene is the [[MS Free Enterprise I|MS ''Free Enterprise I'']]. The ship spent many years as a day cruise ship in Greek waters before being scrapped in 2013. The \"Chinese\" plane delivering the gold to Turin is a rare [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]], of which only 14 were built and only four passed into private ownership. It had been abandoned in Milan by its owners and was moved to Turin for filming. It was destroyed by fire in 1970.<ref name=\"serial\">{{cite web|url=http://cgibin.rcn.com/jeremy.k/cgi-bin/gzUsafSearch.pl?target=&content=Globemaster |title=USAF Serial Number Search Results|accessdate=26 November 2010|work=Aircraft Serial Number Search|first=Jeremy|last=Kuris|date=25 March 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Italian Job (soundtrack)}}\n{{Listen|filename=Matt Monro - On Days Like These excerpt.ogg|title=Matt Monro \u2013 On Days Like These excerpt|description=An excerpt from Matt Monro's ''On Days Like These''}}\nThe music for the soundtrack was written by [[Quincy Jones]].

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval rating of 83% and an average rating of 7.4/10, based on 27 reviews.

He complimented the film's technological sophistication, only criticising what he saw as an 'emotionally retarded' plot. Canby also expressed concern that Coward's appearance in the film, although intended to be kind, 'exploits him in vaguely unpleasant ways' by surrounding his character with images of the royal family, which had not knighted him at the time. A contemporary review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine felt that the film spent too much time focusing on the film's caper as opposed to building the characters; it also criticised the car chases as 'dull and deafening'.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901493,00.html | title = Cinema: Britannia Waives the Rules | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 16 October 2011 | date=19 September 1969}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was the 14th most popular at the UK box office in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World's Top Twenty Films |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=27 September 1970 |via=The Sunday Times Digital Archive }}</ref> Although it received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Best English-Language Foreign Film\", the film was not a success in the US. The film remains popular, however. James Travers of Films de France believes that the film's enduring appeal rests in the 'improbable union' of Michael Caine, No\u00ebl Coward and [[Benny Hill]], whom he considers \"three of the best known [British] performers... in the late 1960s\". He states that the film has a [[cult following|cult status]] and stands as a 'classic of its genre'.<ref name=\"france\"/>\n\nA [[novelisation]] of the film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin and Ken Wlaschin, was published by [[Sphere Books]] in 1969. The book contains numerous differences to the film: for example there is a rival group of German gangsters called the Hamburg Syndicate who try to obtain Beckerman's plans for the robbery, Croker and the three minis travel to Italy by yacht, and Professor Peach is rescued by the gang after he is arrested. The ending of the novel is also significantly different. The bus successfully crosses the border into Switzerland and two days later the gang and the gold arrive on a beach near Dover in a landing craft where they are met by Mr. Bridger and Luigi Altabani. Mr. Bridger tells Charlie Croker that they have come to an agreement to \"divide Europe\" and that the gold must be given back to the Italians.\n\nSince 2000, there have been two remakes of the film. The first was released in 2003 and also called ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'', set in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker. It features [[Donald Sutherland]] as John Bridger, played as more of a father figure to Croker. It employs the updated [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] for a chase towards the end. An official [[Bollywood]] remake of the 2003 film, called ''[[Players (2012 film)|Players]]'', was released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=India to Remake 'The Italian Job'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-remake-italian-job-48404|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=11 July 2018|first=Nyay|last=Bhushan|date=23 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[The Italian Job (2001 video game)|video game]] based on the 1969 film, released for the [[PlayStation]] [[Video game console|game console]] in 2001 and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002 and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. The film was also the subject of a play, ''Bill Shakespeare's \"The Italian Job\"'', written by Malachi Bogdanov, who used lines from Shakespeare plays to tell the story. It was performed in 2003 at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/otherresources/fringe/fringe03-20.htm|title=Fringe 2003 Reviews (20)|work=[[The British Theatre Guide]]|first=Peter|last=Lathan|date=2003|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nMichael Caine's performance and 'bloody doors' line has been parodied in several British comedies, and in a music video for [[Pick a Part That's New]] by [[Stereophonics]].

He grew up in an artistic and literary household: his father [[John Francon Williams]] was a writer, geographer, cartographer and inventor, and his brother [[Aeneas Francon Williams]] was also an artist and a writer. By 1901, the family had moved to the South of England and was living at Queens Grove Road in the affluent area of [[Chingford]] in [[Essex]].<ref>1901 England and Wales Census: https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&query=%2Bgivenname%3A%22Aeneas%20Francon%22~%20%2Bsurname%3AWilliams~%20%2Bbirth_year%3A1886-1886~</ref>\n\nWilliams trained at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[Moray House Training College]], and was awarded a [[Doctor of Arts|DA]] (Edin.).

Maize diversity in Mexico continues to be maintained and managed by smallholder farmers who participate in traditional seed sharing networks. Maize landraces in Mexico are conserved in place, or in-situ, by farmers who continue to grow them in their fields. Commercial maize seed is planted on less than one-fourth of Mexico\u2019s 8 million hectares of arable land<ref name=\":9\" />. The majority of farmers in Mexico use, save, and exchange the seed of traditional maize landraces along with \u201ccreolized\u201d (hybridized or cross-pollinated) commercial [[Cultivar|cultivars]], which are typically planted in small (<5 ha) rain-fed fields<ref name=\":9\" />. \n\nAn estimated 18 percent of maize cultivation in Mexico takes place in the highlands, and maize agro-climates in the highland regions are most at risk from climate change.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many scientists are concerned about the effects climate change poses on maize genetic diversity and the negative impacts that continued maize [[germplasm]] loss will have, not only on Mexican agriculture, but worldwide, as maize is the most widely grown crop in the world.<ref name=\":7\" /> Bellon et al. (2011) discuss the need to strengthen and broaden traditional seed networks in Mexico to support farmers and the genetic integrity of maize in light of climate change; thus, extending the geographic ranges of seed networks to link farmers in the highlands, for example, with farmers in mid-altitude environments.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Coffee ====\n[[File:Coffee Bag.jpg|thumb|Coffee produced in Mexico.]]\nVariable and extreme climatic events such as droughts, floods, and excessive heat will have \u2013 and is already having - important impacts on both the quality and overall production of [[Coffee bean|coffee]] in Mexico.<ref name=\":3\" /> In Mexico and Central America more broadly, some 8.5 million people rely on coffee production for their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2012, higher than average temperatures and high-altitude rains led to an outbreak of [[Hemileia vastatrix|coffee leaf rust]], affecting roughly 50 percent of the coffee crop in Central America.<ref name=\":2\" /> This resulted in $500 million in crop damages to the region and caused many people in the region to lose their livelihoods.<ref name=\":2\" /> Regional studies in Mexico have projected that coffee growing could be unviable by the end of the decade.<ref name=\":3\" /> Responses will need to occur both in the social and ecological realms and across multiple scales. Key strategies include crop diversification and the implementation of more resilient coffee production systems. Farmer education, access to information, health, and equity factors all play important roles in adaptation responses as well.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Yet, there are also large-scale and global factors at play, such as international trade markets, which are often volatile, that are beyond farmers\u2019 control. A handful of coffee companies, NGOs, and agencies have initiated training and education programs for Mexican farmers to better respond to climate change.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Global Impacts ===\nClimate change threatens not only food and economic security in Mexico, but is also tied to much larger, global processes. In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />. Researchers have also noted the importance of state leadership in addressing climate change by, for example, training and preparing farmers for climate adaptation<ref name=\":9\" />.

Maize diversity in Mexico continues to be maintained and managed by smallholder farmers who participate in traditional seed sharing networks. Maize landraces in Mexico are conserved in place, or in-situ, by farmers who continue to grow them in their fields. Commercial maize seed is planted on less than one-fourth of Mexico\u2019s 8 million hectares of arable land<ref name=\":9\" />. The majority of farmers in Mexico use, save, and exchange the seed of traditional maize landraces along with \u201ccreolized\u201d (hybridized or cross-pollinated) commercial [[Cultivar|cultivars]], which are typically planted in small (<5 ha) rain-fed fields<ref name=\":9\" />. \n\nAn estimated 18 percent of maize cultivation in Mexico takes place in the highlands, and maize agro-climates in the highland regions are most at risk from climate change.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many scientists are concerned about the effects climate change poses on maize genetic diversity and the negative impacts that continued maize [[germplasm]] loss will have, not only on Mexican agriculture, but worldwide, as maize is the most widely grown crop in the world.<ref name=\":7\" /> Bellon et al.

Key strategies include crop diversification and the implementation of more resilient coffee production systems. Farmer education, access to information, health, and equity factors all play important roles in adaptation responses as well.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Yet, there are also large-scale and global factors at play, such as international trade markets, which are often volatile, that are beyond farmers\u2019 control. A handful of coffee companies, NGOs, and agencies have initiated training and education programs for Mexican farmers to better respond to climate change.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Global Impacts ===\nClimate change threatens not only food and economic security in Mexico, but is also tied to much larger, global processes. In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />. Researchers have also noted the importance of state leadership in addressing climate change by, for example, training and preparing farmers for climate adaptation<ref name=\":9\" />.
