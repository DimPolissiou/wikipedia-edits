The following is the verse quoted in this context:-'''Where the grass is green and abundant,Where the grass appears beautiful In that blissful site let our sheep Thrive, and afford us good pasture,And such lands, and give us the strength in battles.20'''.  The above references provide evidences that there was a community of [[shepherds]] among the Aryans. The scholars referred above have, therefore, declared that the present day shepherds be treated as the descendants of the Aryan race.

They lived in Brindavan, rearing animals and eking their livelihood by selling dairy products.

During the reign of Rajaraja Narendra, it was said that they immigrated to southern regions from Repalle. It is because of the above inferences, the Gollas consider themselves to belong to the Yadava clan or Golla kings. The very term Golla kings asserts their kinship with [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]], besides asserting them to be of a higher stratum of the society.

The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers.

It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

Kumara Kampana was tasked with protecting the temple Endowments and recruiting many leaders to take on the responsibilities of Pandya Nadu.\n\nHis wife [[Gangadevi]], who was present during the invasion of Madurai, records the siege and conquest of Madurai in her Sanskrit treatise [[Madura Vijayam|Madhura Vijayam]].<ref name=\"Jackson2005\">{{cite book|author=William Joseph Jackson|title=Vijayanagara Voices: Exploring South Indian History and Hindu Literature|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3950-3|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=PxvDNBc4qwUC&pg=PA61 61]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tamilvu.org/slet/lA100/lA100pd1.jsp?bookid=224&pno=392 |title = Tvu}}</ref>\n\n==Sri Krishnadevaraya's Clan==\n\n[[File:vijayanagara.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sri Krishnadevaraya]]\n\n* The Below informations are Published by [[Archeological Survey of India]] in the book \"Annual Report of the Mysore Archeological Department\".\n\n===Nanjagud Taluk Inscription Translation===\nBe it well.

Victory to the Adorable (Padmanabha) who resembles the sky free\nfrom clouds.While the illustrious Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja seated on the stable throne, \u2018the prosperous king of kings, lord of kings, champion over those who wear moustaches in the great earth, kathdri-sahwa (dagger and kite), ruler over the southern sea,\nNarasimha-mahadhiraja\u2019s son ; a sun to the firmament that is the [[Yadava]] race of\nwhich he is a lineal descendant ; crest-jewel to righteousness, (delighter) of all the\nassemblage of bards, brother to the wives of others, support for purity, heroism and prowess; possessed of lotus-like feet on which bow the jewelled crowns of all the kings, kathari-trinitra (a Siva in the use of dagger) : was ruling the earth :\u2014 Under the orders of vira Krishnaraya, while he was pleased to go on a victorious\nexpedition to the south : \u2014the illustrious mahapradhana (chief minister) Saluva\nTimmarasa of Yajus-sakha, Khandava-gotra, and Apastambha-sutra made a gift to the best of the gods, Kirtinarayanadevaru of [[Talakadu|Talakad]] which is Rajarajapura, south Benares and Gajaranya-kshetra, of the village Kavahalli in Thayuru-sthala, with the right to enjoy the eight rights and powers in the village including all the rice-fields, dry lands, gardens, vegetable gardens (tudike), money income, treasure, deposits underground, water springs, rocks, imperishables, future accruals, existing rights and possibilities. The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers. He who seizes land gifted by himsolf or by others is borm as a worm in ordure for 60,000 years. Whoever destroys this gift will incur the sin of killing tawny cows on the banks of the [[Ganges]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.501532|title=Annual Report Of The Mysore Archaeological Department, For The Year 1930|first=M.H.|last=Krishna|date=1934|language=english}}</ref>\n\n'''Note'''\n\nThis is a record registering the grant of a village called Kavahalli or Kalihalli (same as the present village Kahalli) for services in the Kirtinarayana temple at Talakad on the Kaveri river in T.-Narsipur Taluk, Mysore District. It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

He was known for his [[Mid-Atlantic accent|transatlantic accent]], debonair demeanor, light-hearted approach to acting, and sense of comic timing. \n\nGrant was born in [[Horfield]], [[Bristol]]. He became attracted to theater at a young age and began performing with a troupe known as \"The Penders\" at age six. At the age of 16, he went as a stage performer with the Pender Troupe for a tour of the US. After a series of successful performances in New York City, he decided to stay there.{{sfn|McCann|1997|pp=44\u201346}} He established a name for himself in [[vaudeville]] in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s. \n\nGrant initially appeared in crime films or dramas such as ''[[Blonde Venus]]'' (1932) with [[Marlene Dietrich]] and ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'' (1933) with [[Mae West]], but later gained renown for his performances in romantic and [[Screwball comedy|screwball]] comedies such as ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937) with [[Irene Dunne]], ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) with [[Katharine Hepburn]], ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940) with Hepburn and [[James Stewart]], often with some of the biggest female stars of the day.

He also began to move into dramas such as ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), ''[[Penny Serenade]]'' (1941) and [[Clifford Odets]]' ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (film)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'' (1944); he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the latter two.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Grant developed a close working relationship with director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who cast the popular actor in several of his critically acclaimed films, including ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959). The suspense-dramas ''Suspicion'' and ''Notorious'' both involved Grant showing a darker, more ambiguous nature in his characters. Toward the end of his film career, Grant was praised by critics as a romantic leading man, and he received five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, including ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]'' (1958) with [[Ingrid Bergman]], ''[[That Touch of Mink]]'' (1962) with [[Doris Day]], and ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963) with [[Audrey Hepburn]]. He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal as a handsome, suave actor who did not take himself too seriously, able to play with his own dignity in comedies without sacrificing it entirely.\n\nGrant was married five times, three of them elopements with actresses [[Virginia Cherrill]] (1934\u20131935), [[Betsy Drake]] (1949\u20131962), and [[Dyan Cannon]] (1965\u20131968). He retired from film acting in 1966 and pursued numerous business interests, representing cosmetics firm [[Faberg\u00e9 (cosmetics)|Faberg\u00e9]] and sitting on the board of [[MGM]].

He was known for his [[Mid-Atlantic accent|transatlantic accent]], debonair demeanor, light-hearted approach to acting, and sense of comic timing. \n\nGrant was born in [[Horfield]], [[Bristol]]. He became attracted to theater at a young age and began performing with a troupe known as \"The Penders\" at age six. At the age of 16, he went as a stage performer with the Pender Troupe for a tour of the US. After a series of successful performances in New York City, he decided to stay there.{{sfn|McCann|1997|pp=44\u201346}} He established a name for himself in [[vaudeville]] in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s. \n\nGrant initially appeared in crime films or dramas such as ''[[Blonde Venus]]'' (1932) with [[Marlene Dietrich]] and ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'' (1933) with [[Mae West]], but later gained renown for his performances in romantic and [[Screwball comedy|screwball]] comedies such as ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937) with [[Irene Dunne]], ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) with [[Katharine Hepburn]], ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940) with Hepburn and [[James Stewart]], often with some of the biggest female stars of the day.

He also began to move into dramas such as ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939), ''[[Penny Serenade]]'' (1941) and [[Clifford Odets]]' ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (film)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'' (1944); he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the latter two.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Grant developed a close working relationship with director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], who cast the popular actor in several of his critically acclaimed films, including ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959). The suspense-dramas ''Suspicion'' and ''Notorious'' both involved Grant showing a darker, more ambiguous nature in his characters. Toward the end of his film career, Grant was praised by critics as a romantic leading man, and he received five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, including ''[[Indiscreet (1958 film)|Indiscreet]]'' (1958) with [[Ingrid Bergman]], ''[[That Touch of Mink]]'' (1962) with [[Doris Day]], and ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963) with [[Audrey Hepburn]]. He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal as a handsome, suave actor who did not take himself too seriously, able to play with his own dignity in comedies without sacrificing it entirely.\n\nGrant was married five times, three of them elopements with actresses [[Virginia Cherrill]] (1934\u20131935), [[Betsy Drake]] (1949\u20131962), and [[Dyan Cannon]] (1965\u20131968).

The Mustang was designed in April 1940 by a design team headed by James Kindelberger<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guilmartin |first1=John |title=P-51 Mustang Facts |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/P-51 |website=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref> of [[North American Aviation]] (NAA) in response to a requirement of the [[British Purchasing Commission]]. The Purchasing Commission approached North American Aviation to build [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 fighters]] under license for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). Rather than build an old design from another company, North American Aviation proposed the design and production of a more modern fighter. The prototype NA-73X [[airframe]] was rolled out on 9 September 1940, 102 days after the contract was signed, and first flew on 26 October.<ref>Borth 1945, pp. 92, 244.</ref><ref>Kinzey 1996, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Mustang was designed to use the [[Allison V-1710]] engine, which had limited high-altitude performance in its earlier variants.

As the first Mustangs were built to British requirements, these aircraft used factory numbers and were not P-51s; the order comprised 320 NA-73s, followed by 300 NA-83s, all of which were designated '''North American Mustang Mark I''' by the RAF.<ref>Gruenhagen 1980, p. 193.</ref> The first RAF Mustangs supplied under [[Lend-Lease]] were 93 P-51s, designated '''Mk Ia''', followed by 50 P-51As used as '''Mustang Mk II'''s.<ref>Gruenhagen 1980, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> Aircraft supplied to Britain under Lend-Lease were required for accounting purposes to be on the [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC's]] books before they could be supplied to Britain. However, the British Aircraft Purchasing Commission signed its first contract for the North American NA-73 on 24 April 1940, before Lend-Lease was in effect. Thus, the initial order for the P-51 Mustang (as it was later known) was placed by the British under the \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|Cash and Carry]]\" program, as required by the US Neutrality Acts of the 1930s.<ref>James Bjorkman, \"[https://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2014/09/p-51-mustang.html The P-51 Mustang],\" Filminspector.com, Retrieved 13 January 2019.</ref>\n\nAfter the arrival of the initial aircraft in the UK in October 1941, the first Mustang Mk Is entered service in January 1942, the first unit being [[No. 26 Squadron RAF|26 Squadron RAF]].<ref>Delve (1994), p. 191</ref> Due to poor high-altitude performance, the Mustangs were used by [[RAF Army Cooperation Command|Army Co-operation Command]], rather than Fighter Command, and were used for tactical reconnaissance and ground-attack duties. On 10 May 1942, Mustangs first flew over France, near [[Berck-sur-Mer]].<ref>Hatch (1993), p. 15</ref> On 27 July 1942, 16 RAF Mustangs undertook their first long-range reconnaissance mission over Germany. During the amphibious [[Dieppe Raid]] on the French coast (19 August 1942), four British and Canadian Mustang squadrons, including 26 Squadron, saw action covering the assault on the ground. By 1943\u20131944, British Mustangs were used extensively to seek out [[V-1 flying bomb]] sites. The last RAF Mustang Mk I and Mustang Mk II aircraft were struck off charge in 1945.\n\n[[File:Mustang III at Hucknall 1943.jpg|thumb|A Royal Air Force North American Mustang Mk III (''FX908'') on the ground at [[Hucknall#Rolls-Royce|Hucknall]]]]\nThe RAF also operated 308 P-51Bs and 636 P-51Cs,<ref>Gruenhagen 1980, pp. 199\u2013200.</ref> which were known in RAF service as '''Mustang Mk III'''s; the first units converted to the type in late 1943 and early 1944.

In June 1943, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] issued the [[Pointblank Directive]] to destroy the Luftwaffe's capacity before the planned invasion of Europe, putting the CBO into full implementation. German daytime fighter efforts were, at that time, focused on the Eastern Front and several other distant locations. Initial efforts by the 8th met limited and unorganized resistance, but with every mission, the Luftwaffe moved more aircraft to the west and quickly improved their battle direction. In fall 1943, the 8th Air Force's heavy bombers conducted a series of deep-penetration raids into Germany, beyond the range of escort fighters. The [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission]] in August lost 60 B-17s of a force of 376, the [[Second Raid on Schweinfurt|14 October attack]] lost 77 of a force of 291\u201426% of the attacking force. \n\nFor the US, the very concept of self-defending bombers was called into question, but instead of abandoning daylight raids and turning to night bombing, as the RAF suggested, they chose other paths; at first, a bomber with more guns (the [[Boeing YB-40]]) was believed to be able to escort the bomber formations, but when the concept proved to be unsuccessful, thoughts then turned to the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].<ref>Boylan 1955, p. 154.</ref> In early 1943, the USAAF also decided that the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and P-51B be considered for the role of a smaller escort fighter, and in July, a report stated that the P-51B was \"the most promising plane\" with an endurance of 4 hours 45 minutes with the standard internal fuel of 184 gallons plus 150 gallons carried externally.<ref>Boylan 1955, p. 155.</ref> In August, a P-51B was fitted with an extra internal 85-gallon tank, and although problems with longitudinal stability occurred and some compromises in performance with the tank full were made, and because the fuel from the fuselage tank would be used during the initial stages of a mission, the fuel tank would be fitted in all Mustangs destined for [[VIII Fighter Command]].<ref>Boylan 1955, pp. 155\u2013156.</ref>\n\n====P-51 introduction====\nThe P-51 Mustang was a solution to the need for an effective bomber escort. It used a common, reliable engine and had internal space for a larger-than-average fuel load.

This made it unsuitable for combat at the altitudes where USAAF bombers planned to fly. Following the RAF's initial disappointing experience with the Mustang I (P-51A), Ronald Harker, a test pilot for [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], suggested fitting a [[Rolls-Royce Merlin#Basic component overview .28Merlin 61.29|Merlin 61]], as fitted to the [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin-powered variants)#Mk IX .28type 361.29|Spitfire Mk IX]]. The Merlin 61 had a two-speed, two-stage, intercooled supercharger, designed by [[Stanley Hooker]] of Rolls-Royce,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hooker|first1=Stanley|title=Not much of an engineer|date=1984|publisher=Airlife Books|location=UK|isbn=978-1-85310-285-1|pages=56}}</ref> and this gave an increase in horsepower from the Allison's {{convert|1200|-|1620|hp|kW}}, or {{convert|1720|hp|kW}} in [[War emergency power|War Emergency Power]], delivering an increase of top speed from {{convert|390|to|440|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}}, as well as raising the service ceiling to almost {{convert|42000|ft|m}}. Initial flights of what was known to Rolls-Royce as the [[Rolls-Royce Mustang Mk.X|Mustang Mk X]] were completed at [[Hucknall Aerodrome#Rolls-Royce Flight Test Establishment|Rolls-Royce's airfield at Hucknall]] in October 1942.\n\n[[File:Musas 2.jpg|thumb|P-51D on the Inglewood assembly line]]\nAt the same time, the possibility of combining the P-51 airframe with the US license-built Packard version of the Merlin engine was being explored on the other side of the Atlantic. In July 1942 a contract was let for two prototypes, briefly designated XP-78 but soon to become the XP-51B.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gruenhagen |first1=Robert |title=Mustang: The Story of the P-51 Fighter (rev. ed.) |date=1976 |publisher=Arco Publishing |location=New York |page=68}}</ref> The first flight of the XP-51B took place in November 1942, but the USAAF was so interested in the possibility that an initial contract for 400 aircraft was placed three months beforehand in August.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gruenhagen |first1=Robert W. |title=Mustang: The Story of the P-51 Fighter (rev. ed.) |date=1976 |publisher=Arco Publishing |location=New York |page=74}}</ref> The conversion led to production of the P-51B beginning at North American's Inglewood, California, plant in June 1943,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newby Grant|first1=William|title=P-51 Mustang|publisher=Paul Hamlyn Pty Ltd|location=UK|isbn=0-7296-0183-8|pages=24}}</ref> and P-51s started to become available to the 8th and [[Ninth Air Force|9th Air Force]]s in the winter of 1943\u20131944. During the conversion to the two-stage, supercharged Merlin engine, which was slightly heavier than the single-stage Allison, so moved the aircraft's [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|center-of-gravity]] forward, North American's engineers took the opportunity to add a large additional fuselage fuel tank behind the pilot, greatly increasing the aircraft's range over that of the earlier P-51A.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nBy the time the [[Pointblank directive|''Pointblank'' offensive]] resumed in early 1944, matters had changed. Bomber escort defenses were initially layered, using the shorter-range P-38s and P-47s to escort the bombers during the initial stages of the raid before handing over to the P-51s when they were forced to turn for home. This provided continuous coverage during the raid. The Mustang was so clearly superior to earlier US designs that the 8th Air Force began to steadily switch its fighter groups to the Mustang, first swapping arriving P-47 groups to the 9th Air Force in exchange for those that were using P-51s, then gradually converting its Thunderbolt and Lightning groups. By the end of 1944, 14 of its 15 groups flew the Mustang.<ref>Dean 1997, p. 338.</ref>\n\nThe Luftwaffe's twin-engined [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] heavy fighters brought up to deal with the bombers proved to be easy prey for the Mustangs, and had to be quickly withdrawn from combat. The [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]A, already suffering from poor high-altitude performance, was outperformed by the Mustang at the B-17's altitude, and when laden with [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavy bomber-hunting weapons]] as a replacement for the more vulnerable twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rer'' heavy fighters, it suffered heavy losses. The [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] had comparable performance at high altitudes, but its lightweight airframe was even more greatly affected by increases in armament. The Mustang's much lighter armament, tuned for antifighter combat, allowed it to overcome these single-engined opponents.\n\n====Fighting the Luftwaffe====\n[[File:Pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group.jpg|thumb|left|Pilots of the all-Black American [[332d Fighter Group|332nd Fighter Group]] (the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]) at Ramitelli, Italy: From left, Lt. Dempsey W. Morgran, Lt. Carroll S. Woods, Lt. Robert H. Nelron, Jr., Capt. Andrew D. Turner, and Lt. Clarence P. Lester]]\n\nAt the start of 1944, Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], the new commander of the 8th Air Force, ordered many fighter pilots to stop flying in formation with the bombers and instead attack the ''Luftwaffe'' wherever it could be found. The aim was to achieve [[air supremacy]]. Mustang groups were sent far ahead of the bombers in a \"fighter sweep\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters.\n\nThe Luftwaffe answered with the ''Gefechtsverband'' (\"battle formation\"). This consisted of a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|''Sturmgruppe'']] of heavily armed and armored [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]]As escorted by two ''Begleitgruppen'' of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s, whose task was to keep the Mustangs away from the Fw 190As attacking the bombers. This strategy proved to be problematic, as the large German formation took a long time to assemble and was difficult to maneuver. It was often intercepted by the P-51 \"fighter sweeps\" before it could attack the bombers. However, German attacks against bombers could be effective when they did occur; the bomber-destroyer Fw 190As swept in from astern and often pressed their attacks to within {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1|order=flip}}.<ref name= \"Spick p. 111.\">Spick 1983, p. 111.</ref>\n\n[[File:P-51B 100FS 332FG Italy 1944.jpg|thumb|A USAAF armorer of the 100th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group, 15th U.S. Air Force checks ammunition belts of the .50 caliber (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns in the wings of a North American P-51B Mustang in Italy, ''circa'' September 1944]]\nWhile not always able to avoid contact with the escorts, the threat of mass attacks and later the \"company front\" (eight abreast) assaults by armored ''Sturmgruppe'' Fw 190As brought an urgency to attacking the Luftwaffe wherever it could be found, either in the air or on the ground. Beginning [[Big Week|in late February 1944]], 8th Air Force fighter units began systematic strafing attacks on German airfields with increasing frequency and intensity throughout the spring, with the objective of gaining air supremacy over the [[Normandy]] battlefield. In general these were conducted by units returning from escort missions but, beginning in March, many groups also were assigned airfield attacks instead of bomber support. The P-51, particularly with the advent of the K-14 [[Gyro gunsight]] and the development of \"Clobber Colleges\" for the training of fighter pilots in fall 1944, was a decisive element in Allied countermeasures against the ''Jagdverb\u00e4nde''.\n\nThe numerical superiority of the USAAF fighters, superb flying characteristics of the P-51, and pilot proficiency helped cripple the Luftwaffe's fighter force. As a result, the fighter threat to US, and later British, bombers was greatly diminished by July 1944. The RAF, long proponents of night bombing for protection, were able to reopen daylight bombing in 1944 as a result of the crippling of the Luftwaffe fighter arm.

As the efficacy of these missions increased, the number of fighters at the German airbases fell to the point where they were no longer considered worthwhile targets. On 21 May, targets were expanded to include railways, [[locomotive]]s, and [[rolling stock]] used by the Germans to transport materiel and troops, in missions dubbed \"Chattanooga\".<ref>Olmsted 1994, p. 144.</ref> The P-51 excelled at this mission, although losses were much higher on strafing missions than in air-to-air combat, partially because the Mustang's liquid-cooled engine (particularly its coolant system) was vulnerable to small-arms fire, unlike the air-cooled [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800|R-2800]] radials of its [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] stablemates based in England, regularly tasked with ground-strafing missions.\n\n[[File:P-51D Urban Drew.jpg|thumb|P-51D Mustang ''Detroit Miss'' of the 375th Fighter Squadron: [[Urban L. Drew]] flew this aircraft in the autumn 1944 and shot down six German aircraft, including two jet-powered [[Me 262]]s in a single mission.]]\nGiven the overwhelming Allied [[air superiority]], the Luftwaffe put its effort into the development of aircraft of such high performance that they could operate with impunity, but which also made bomber attack much more difficult, merely from the flight velocities they achieved. Foremost among these were the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]B point-defense rocket interceptors, which started their operations with [[JG 400]] near the end of July 1944, and the longer-endurance [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]A jet fighter, first flying with the [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|''Gruppe'']]-strength [[Kommando Nowotny]] unit by the end of September 1944. In action, the Me 163 proved to be [[Hypergolic propellant#History|more dangerous to the Luftwaffe]] than to the Allies, and was never a serious threat. The Me 262A was a serious threat, but attacks on their airfields neutralized them. The pioneering [[Junkers Jumo 004]] [[Axial compressor|axial-flow]] [[Turbojet|jet engine]]s of the Me 262As needed careful nursing by their pilots, and these aircraft were particularly vulnerable during takeoff and landing.<ref>Forsyth 1996, pp. 149, 194.</ref> Lt. [[Chuck Yeager]] of the [[357th Fighter Group]] was one of the first American pilots to shoot down an Me 262, which he caught during its landing approach. On 7 October 1944, Lt. [[Urban L.

[[Hubert Zemke]], who had transferred to the Mustang-equipped [[479th Fighter Group]], shot down what he thought was a Bf 109, only to have his gun camera film reveal that it may have been an Me 262.<ref>Scutts 1994, p. 58.</ref> On 25 February 1945, Mustangs of the [[55th Fighter Group]] surprised an entire [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Staffel|''Staffel'']] of Me 262As at takeoff and destroyed six jets.<ref>[[Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft]], p. 12.</ref>\n\nThe Mustang also proved useful against the [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]]s launched toward London. P-51B/Cs using 150-octane fuel were fast enough to catch the V-1 and operated in concert with shorter-range aircraft such as advanced marks of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Tempest]].\n\nBy 8 May 1945,<ref name=\"Glancey p. 188\">Glancey 2006, p. 188.</ref> the [[United States Air Forces in Europe#Lineage|8th]], [[USAFCENT#Ninth Air Force 1943 to June 1944|9th]], and [[15th Expeditionary Mobility Task Force|15th Air Force]]'s P-51 groups {{#tag:ref|All but three of these FGs flew P-38s, P-40s or P-47s before converting to the Mustang.|group=nb}} claimed some 4,950 aircraft shot down (about half of all USAAF claims in the European theater, the most claimed by any Allied fighter in air-to-air combat)<ref name=\"Glancey p. 188\" /> and 4,131 destroyed on the ground.

The top Mustang ace was the USAAF's [[George Preddy]], whose final tally stood at 26.83 victories (a number that includes shared one half- and one third victory credits), 23 of which were scored with the P-51.

These Mustangs were provided to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Fighter Groups and used to attack Japanese targets in occupied areas of China. The P-51 became the most capable fighter in China, while the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] used the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] ''Hayate'' against it.\n\nThe P-51 was a relative latecomer to the Pacific Theater, due largely to the need for the aircraft in Europe, although the P-38's twin-engined design was considered a safety advantage for long, over-water flights. The first P-51s were deployed in the Far East later in 1944, operating in close-support and escort missions, as well as tactical photo reconnaissance. As the war in Europe wound down, the P-51 became more common; eventually, with the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|capture of Iwo Jima]], it was able to be used as a bomber escort during [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] missions [[Air raids on Japan|against the Japanese homeland]].\n\nThe P-51 was often mistaken for the Japanese [[Kawasaki Ki-61]] ''Hien'' in both China and Pacific because of its similar appearance.\n\n===Pilot observations===\nChief Naval Test Pilot and C.O.

It was also the best American dogfighter. But the laminar-flow wing fitted to the Mustang could be a little tricky. It could not by any means out-turn a Spitfire. No way. It had a good rate-of-roll, better than the Spitfire, so I would say the plusses to the Spitfire and the Mustang just about equate. If I were in a dogfight, I'd prefer to be flying the Spitfire. The problem was I wouldn't like to be in a dogfight near Berlin, because I could never get home to Britain in a Spitfire!\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7PeDPQAACAAJ |isbn=978-1-903223-98-7 |page=233 |title=Air Combat Manoeuvres: The Technique and History of Air Fighting for Flight Simulation |last1=Thompson |first1=Steve |last2=Smith |first2=Peter C. |last3=Allan |first3=Ian |last4=Spinetta |first4=Lawrence J. |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Air Forces, Flight Test Engineering, assessed the Mustang B on 24 April 1944 thus: \"The rate of climb is good and the high speed in level flight is exceptionally good at all altitudes, from sea level to 40,000 feet.

As the more advanced ([[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|P-80]] and [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|P-84]]) jet fighters were introduced, the P-51 was also relegated to secondary duties.\n\nIn 1947, the newly formed [[USAF]] [[Strategic Air Command]] employed Mustangs alongside F-6 Mustangs and [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang|F-82 Twin Mustang]]s, due to their range capabilities. In 1948, the designation P-51 (P for pursuit) was changed to '''F-51''' (F for fighter) and the existing F designator for photographic reconnaissance aircraft was dropped because of a new designation scheme throughout the USAF. Aircraft still in service in the USAF or [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) when the system was changed included: '''F-51B''', '''F-51D''', '''F-51K''', '''RF-51D''' (formerly '''F-6D'''), '''RF-51K''' (formerly '''F-6K''') and '''TRF-51D''' (two-seat trainer conversions of F-6Ds). They remained in service from 1946 through 1951. By 1950, although Mustangs continued in service with the USAF after the war, the majority of the USAF's Mustangs had become surplus to requirements and placed in storage, while some were transferred to the [[Air Force Reserve]] and the ANG.\n\n[[File:F-51 in Puddle, Korean War.jpg|right|thumb|An F-51 Mustang, laden with bombs and rockets, taxis through a puddle at an airbase in Korea.]]\nFrom the start of the [[Korean War]], the Mustang once again proved useful. A \"substantial number\" of stored or in-service F-51Ds were shipped, via aircraft carriers, to the combat zone, and were used by the USAF, the South African Air Force, and the [[Republic of Korea Air Force]] (ROKAF). The F-51 was used for ground attack, fitted with rockets and bombs, and photo reconnaissance, rather than being as interceptors or \"pure\" fighters. After the first North Korean invasion, USAF units were forced to fly from bases in Japan and the F-51Ds, with their long range and endurance, could attack targets in Korea that short-ranged F-80 jets could not. Because of the vulnerable liquid cooling system, however, the F-51s sustained heavy losses to ground fire.<ref name=\"NMUSAF\" /> Due to its lighter structure and a shortage of spare parts, the newer, faster F-51H was not used in Korea.\n\nMustangs continued flying with USAF and ROKAF fighter-bomber units on close support and interdiction missions in Korea until 1953, when they were largely replaced as fighter-bombers by USAF F-84s and by [[United States Navy]] (USN) [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s. Other air forces and units using the Mustang included the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadron]], which flew Australian-built Mustangs as part of [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]]. The Mustangs were replaced by [[Gloster Meteor]] F8s in 1951. The [[South African Air Force]]'s [[No. 2 Squadron SAAF|2 Squadron]] used U.S.-built Mustangs as part of the [[18th Wing|U.S. 18th Fighter Bomber Wing]] and had suffered heavy losses by 1953, after which 2 Squadron converted to the F-86 Sabre.\n\nF-51s flew in the [[Air Force Reserve]] and ANG throughout the 1950s. The last American USAF Mustang was F-51D-30-NA AF serial no. 44-74936, which was finally withdrawn from service with the [[West Virginia Air National Guard]]'s [[167th Airlift Squadron|167th Fighter Interceptor Squadron]] in January 1957 and retired to what was then called the Air Force Central Museum,<ref>United Press, \"Last of Prop Fighters Will Go to Museum\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Saturday 26 January 1957, Volume LXIII, Number 127, page 22.</ref> although it was briefly reactivated to fly at the 50th anniversary of the Air Force Aerial Firepower Demonstration at the Air Proving Ground, [[Eglin AFB]], Florida, on 6 May 1957.<ref>\"'Mustang' Taken Out of Mothballs For Demonstration\".

Note: postwar \"uncuffed\" propeller unit.]]\nThe final withdrawal of the Mustang from USAF dumped hundreds of P-51s onto the civilian market. The rights to the Mustang design were purchased from North American by the [[Cavalier Aircraft]] Corporation, which attempted to market the surplus Mustang aircraft in the U.S. and overseas. In 1967 and again in 1972, the USAF procured batches of remanufactured Mustangs from Cavalier, most of them destined for air forces in South America and Asia that were participating in the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act|Military Assistance Program]] (MAP). These aircraft were remanufactured from existing original F-51D airframes fitted with new V-1650-7 engines, a new radio, tall F-51H-type vertical tails, and a stronger wing that could carry six {{convert|0.50|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} machine guns and a total of eight underwing hardpoints. Two {{convert|1,000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bombs and six {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} rockets could be carried. They all had an original F-51D-type canopy, but carried a second seat for an observer behind the pilot. One additional Mustang was a two-seat, dual-control TF-51D (67-14866) with an enlarged canopy and only four wing guns. Although these remanufactured Mustangs were intended for sale to South American and Asian nations through the MAP, they were delivered to the USAF with full USAF markings. They were, however, allocated new serial numbers (67-14862/14866, 67-22579/22582 and 72-1526/1541).<ref name= \"Gunston P-51\" />\n\nThe last U.S. military use of the F-51 was in 1968, when the U. S. Army employed a vintage F-51D (44-72990) as a chase aircraft for the [[AH-56 Cheyenne|Lockheed YAH-56 Cheyenne]] armed helicopter project. This aircraft was so successful that the Army ordered two F-51Ds from Cavalier in 1968 for use at [[Fort Rucker]] as chase planes. They were assigned the serials 68-15795 and 68-15796. These F-51s had wingtip fuel tanks and were unarmed. Following the end of the Cheyenne program, these two chase aircraft were used for other projects. One of them (68-15795) was fitted with a 106&nbsp;mm recoilless rifle for evaluation of the weapon's value in attacking fortified ground targets.<ref>Wixey 2001, p. 55.</ref> Cavalier Mustang 68-15796 survives at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]], [[Eglin AFB]], Florida, displayed indoors in World War II markings.\n\nThe F-51 was adopted by many foreign air forces and continued to be an effective fighter into the mid-1980s with smaller air arms. The last Mustang ever downed in battle occurred during [[Operation Power Pack]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1965, with the last aircraft finally being retired by the Dominican Air Force in 1984.<ref>[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_153.shtml \"Dominican Republic.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829114424/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_153.shtml |date=29 August 2006 }} ''acig.org.''

Handling had to be done with much care when fuel tanks were fully used, and several aerobatic maneuvers were forbidden. Overall, the P-51D was highly rated even compared to the other primary postwar fighter in Italian service, the Supermarine Spitfire, partly because these P-51Ds were in very good condition in contrast to all other Allied fighters supplied to Italy.

The Mustang was designed in April 1940 by a design team headed by James Kindelberger<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guilmartin |first1=John |title=P-51 Mustang Facts |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/P-51 |website=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref> of [[North American Aviation]] (NAA) in response to a requirement of the [[British Purchasing Commission]]. The Purchasing Commission approached North American Aviation to build [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40 fighters]] under license for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). Rather than build an old design from another company, North American Aviation proposed the design and production of a more modern fighter. The prototype NA-73X [[airframe]] was rolled out on 9 September 1940, 102 days after the contract was signed, and first flew on 26 October.<ref>Borth 1945, pp. 92, 244.</ref><ref>Kinzey 1996, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Mustang was designed to use the [[Allison V-1710]] engine, which had limited high-altitude performance in its earlier variants.

As the first Mustangs were built to British requirements, these aircraft used factory numbers and were not P-51s; the order comprised 320 NA-73s, followed by 300 NA-83s, all of which were designated '''North American Mustang Mark I''' by the RAF.<ref>Gruenhagen 1980, p. 193.</ref> The first RAF Mustangs supplied under [[Lend-Lease]] were 93 P-51s, designated '''Mk Ia''', followed by 50 P-51As used as '''Mustang Mk II'''s.<ref>Gruenhagen 1980, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> Aircraft supplied to Britain under Lend-Lease were required for accounting purposes to be on the [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC's]] books before they could be supplied to Britain. However, the British Aircraft Purchasing Commission signed its first contract for the North American NA-73 on 24 April 1940, before Lend-Lease was in effect. Thus, the initial order for the P-51 Mustang (as it was later known) was placed by the British under the \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|Cash and Carry]]\" program, as required by the US Neutrality Acts of the 1930s.<ref>James Bjorkman, \"[https://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2014/09/p-51-mustang.html The P-51 Mustang],\" Filminspector.com, Retrieved 13 January 2019.</ref>\n\nAfter the arrival of the initial aircraft in the UK in October 1941, the first Mustang Mk Is entered service in January 1942, the first unit being [[No. 26 Squadron RAF|26 Squadron RAF]].<ref>Delve (1994), p. 191</ref> Due to poor high-altitude performance, the Mustangs were used by [[RAF Army Cooperation Command|Army Co-operation Command]], rather than Fighter Command, and were used for tactical reconnaissance and ground-attack duties. On 10 May 1942, Mustangs first flew over France, near [[Berck-sur-Mer]].<ref>Hatch (1993), p. 15</ref> On 27 July 1942, 16 RAF Mustangs undertook their first long-range reconnaissance mission over Germany. During the amphibious [[Dieppe Raid]] on the French coast (19 August 1942), four British and Canadian Mustang squadrons, including 26 Squadron, saw action covering the assault on the ground. By 1943\u20131944, British Mustangs were used extensively to seek out [[V-1 flying bomb]] sites. The last RAF Mustang Mk I and Mustang Mk II aircraft were struck off charge in 1945.\n\n[[File:Mustang III at Hucknall 1943.jpg|thumb|A Royal Air Force North American Mustang Mk III (''FX908'') on the ground at [[Hucknall#Rolls-Royce|Hucknall]]]]\nThe RAF also operated 308 P-51Bs and 636 P-51Cs,<ref>Gruenhagen 1980, pp. 199\u2013200.</ref> which were known in RAF service as '''Mustang Mk III'''s; the first units converted to the type in late 1943 and early 1944.

In June 1943, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] issued the [[Pointblank Directive]] to destroy the Luftwaffe's capacity before the planned invasion of Europe, putting the CBO into full implementation. German daytime fighter efforts were, at that time, focused on the Eastern Front and several other distant locations. Initial efforts by the 8th met limited and unorganized resistance, but with every mission, the Luftwaffe moved more aircraft to the west and quickly improved their battle direction. In fall 1943, the 8th Air Force's heavy bombers conducted a series of deep-penetration raids into Germany, beyond the range of escort fighters. The [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission]] in August lost 60 B-17s of a force of 376, the [[Second Raid on Schweinfurt|14 October attack]] lost 77 of a force of 291\u201426% of the attacking force. \n\nFor the US, the very concept of self-defending bombers was called into question, but instead of abandoning daylight raids and turning to night bombing, as the RAF suggested, they chose other paths; at first, a bomber with more guns (the [[Boeing YB-40]]) was believed to be able to escort the bomber formations, but when the concept proved to be unsuccessful, thoughts then turned to the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].<ref>Boylan 1955, p. 154.</ref> In early 1943, the USAAF also decided that the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and P-51B be considered for the role of a smaller escort fighter, and in July, a report stated that the P-51B was \"the most promising plane\" with an endurance of 4 hours 45 minutes with the standard internal fuel of 184 gallons plus 150 gallons carried externally.<ref>Boylan 1955, p. 155.</ref> In August, a P-51B was fitted with an extra internal 85-gallon tank, and although problems with longitudinal stability occurred and some compromises in performance with the tank full were made, and because the fuel from the fuselage tank would be used during the initial stages of a mission, the fuel tank would be fitted in all Mustangs destined for [[VIII Fighter Command]].<ref>Boylan 1955, pp. 155\u2013156.</ref>\n\n====P-51 introduction====\nThe P-51 Mustang was a solution to the need for an effective bomber escort. It used a common, reliable engine and had internal space for a larger-than-average fuel load.

This made it unsuitable for combat at the altitudes where USAAF bombers planned to fly. Following the RAF's initial disappointing experience with the Mustang I (P-51A), Ronald Harker, a test pilot for [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], suggested fitting a [[Rolls-Royce Merlin#Basic component overview .28Merlin 61.29|Merlin 61]], as fitted to the [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin-powered variants)#Mk IX .28type 361.29|Spitfire Mk IX]]. The Merlin 61 had a two-speed, two-stage, intercooled supercharger, designed by [[Stanley Hooker]] of Rolls-Royce,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hooker|first1=Stanley|title=Not much of an engineer|date=1984|publisher=Airlife Books|location=UK|isbn=978-1-85310-285-1|pages=56}}</ref> and this gave an increase in horsepower from the Allison's {{convert|1200|-|1620|hp|kW}}, or {{convert|1720|hp|kW}} in War Emergency Power, delivering an increase of top speed from {{convert|390|to|440|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}}, as well as raising the service ceiling to almost {{convert|42000|ft|m}}. Initial flights of what was known to Rolls-Royce as the [[Rolls-Royce Mustang Mk.X|Mustang Mk X]] were completed at [[Hucknall Aerodrome#Rolls-Royce Flight Test Establishment|Rolls-Royce's airfield at Hucknall]] in October 1942.\n\n[[File:Musas 2.jpg|thumb|P-51D on the Inglewood assembly line]]\nAt the same time, the possibility of combining the P-51 airframe with the US license-built Packard version of the Merlin engine was being explored on the other side of the Atlantic. In July 1942 a contract was let for two prototypes, briefly designated XP-78 but soon to become the XP-51B.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gruenhagen |first1=Robert |title=Mustang: The Story of the P-51 Fighter (rev. ed.) |date=1976 |publisher=Arco Publishing |location=New York |page=68}}</ref> The first flight of the XP-51B took place in November 1942, but the USAAF was so interested in the possibility that an initial contract for 400 aircraft was placed three months beforehand in August.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gruenhagen |first1=Robert W. |title=Mustang: The Story of the P-51 Fighter (rev. ed.) |date=1976 |publisher=Arco Publishing |location=New York |page=74}}</ref> The conversion led to production of the P-51B beginning at North American's Inglewood, California, plant in June 1943,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Newby Grant|first1=William|title=P-51 Mustang|publisher=Paul Hamlyn Pty Ltd|location=UK|isbn=0-7296-0183-8|pages=24}}</ref> and P-51s started to become available to the 8th and [[Ninth Air Force|9th Air Force]]s in the winter of 1943\u20131944. During the conversion to the two-stage, supercharged Merlin engine, which was slightly heavier than the single-stage Allison, so moved the aircraft's [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|center-of-gravity]] forward, North American's engineers took the opportunity to add a large additional fuselage fuel tank behind the pilot, greatly increasing the aircraft's range over that of the earlier P-51A.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nBy the time the [[Pointblank directive|''Pointblank'' offensive]] resumed in early 1944, matters had changed. Bomber escort defenses were initially layered, using the shorter-range P-38s and P-47s to escort the bombers during the initial stages of the raid before handing over to the P-51s when they were forced to turn for home. This provided continuous coverage during the raid. The Mustang was so clearly superior to earlier US designs that the 8th Air Force began to steadily switch its fighter groups to the Mustang, first swapping arriving P-47 groups to the 9th Air Force in exchange for those that were using P-51s, then gradually converting its Thunderbolt and Lightning groups. By the end of 1944, 14 of its 15 groups flew the Mustang.<ref>Dean 1997, p. 338.</ref>\n\nThe Luftwaffe's twin-engined [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] heavy fighters brought up to deal with the bombers proved to be easy prey for the Mustangs, and had to be quickly withdrawn from combat. The [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]A, already suffering from poor high-altitude performance, was outperformed by the Mustang at the B-17's altitude, and when laden with [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavy bomber-hunting weapons]] as a replacement for the more vulnerable twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rer'' heavy fighters, it suffered heavy losses. The [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] had comparable performance at high altitudes, but its lightweight airframe was even more greatly affected by increases in armament. The Mustang's much lighter armament, tuned for antifighter combat, allowed it to overcome these single-engined opponents.\n\n====Fighting the Luftwaffe====\n[[File:Pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group.jpg|thumb|left|Pilots of the all-Black American [[332d Fighter Group|332nd Fighter Group]] (the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]) at Ramitelli, Italy: From left, Lt. Dempsey W. Morgran, Lt. Carroll S. Woods, Lt. Robert H. Nelron, Jr., Capt. Andrew D. Turner, and Lt. Clarence P. Lester]]\n\nAt the start of 1944, Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], the new commander of the 8th Air Force, ordered many fighter pilots to stop flying in formation with the bombers and instead attack the ''Luftwaffe'' wherever it could be found. The aim was to achieve [[air supremacy]]. Mustang groups were sent far ahead of the bombers in a \"fighter sweep\" in order to intercept attacking German fighters.\n\nThe Luftwaffe answered with the ''Gefechtsverband'' (\"battle formation\"). This consisted of a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|''Sturmgruppe'']] of heavily armed and armored [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]]As escorted by two ''Begleitgruppen'' of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s, whose task was to keep the Mustangs away from the Fw 190As attacking the bombers. This strategy proved to be problematic, as the large German formation took a long time to assemble and was difficult to maneuver. It was often intercepted by the P-51 \"fighter sweeps\" before it could attack the bombers. However, German attacks against bombers could be effective when they did occur; the bomber-destroyer Fw 190As swept in from astern and often pressed their attacks to within {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1|order=flip}}.<ref name= \"Spick p. 111.\">Spick 1983, p. 111.</ref>\n\n[[File:P-51B 100FS 332FG Italy 1944.jpg|thumb|A USAAF armorer of the 100th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group, 15th U.S. Air Force checks ammunition belts of the .50 caliber (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns in the wings of a North American P-51B Mustang in Italy, ''circa'' September 1944]]\nWhile not always able to avoid contact with the escorts, the threat of mass attacks and later the \"company front\" (eight abreast) assaults by armored ''Sturmgruppe'' Fw 190As brought an urgency to attacking the Luftwaffe wherever it could be found, either in the air or on the ground. Beginning [[Big Week|in late February 1944]], 8th Air Force fighter units began systematic strafing attacks on German airfields with increasing frequency and intensity throughout the spring, with the objective of gaining air supremacy over the [[Normandy]] battlefield. In general these were conducted by units returning from escort missions but, beginning in March, many groups also were assigned airfield attacks instead of bomber support. The P-51, particularly with the advent of the K-14 [[Gyro gunsight]] and the development of \"Clobber Colleges\" for the training of fighter pilots in fall 1944, was a decisive element in Allied countermeasures against the ''Jagdverb\u00e4nde''.\n\nThe numerical superiority of the USAAF fighters, superb flying characteristics of the P-51, and pilot proficiency helped cripple the Luftwaffe's fighter force. As a result, the fighter threat to US, and later British, bombers was greatly diminished by July 1944. The RAF, long proponents of night bombing for protection, were able to reopen daylight bombing in 1944 as a result of the crippling of the Luftwaffe fighter arm.

As the efficacy of these missions increased, the number of fighters at the German airbases fell to the point where they were no longer considered worthwhile targets. On 21 May, targets were expanded to include railways, [[locomotive]]s, and [[rolling stock]] used by the Germans to transport materiel and troops, in missions dubbed \"Chattanooga\".<ref>Olmsted 1994, p. 144.</ref> The P-51 excelled at this mission, although losses were much higher on strafing missions than in air-to-air combat, partially because the Mustang's liquid-cooled engine (particularly its coolant system) was vulnerable to small-arms fire, unlike the air-cooled [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800|R-2800]] radials of its [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] stablemates based in England, regularly tasked with ground-strafing missions.\n\n[[File:P-51D Urban Drew.jpg|thumb|P-51D Mustang ''Detroit Miss'' of the 375th Fighter Squadron: [[Urban L. Drew]] flew this aircraft in the autumn 1944 and shot down six German aircraft, including two jet-powered [[Me 262]]s in a single mission.]]\nGiven the overwhelming Allied [[air superiority]], the Luftwaffe put its effort into the development of aircraft of such high performance that they could operate with impunity, but which also made bomber attack much more difficult, merely from the flight velocities they achieved. Foremost among these were the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]B point-defense rocket interceptors, which started their operations with [[JG 400]] near the end of July 1944, and the longer-endurance [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]A jet fighter, first flying with the [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|''Gruppe'']]-strength [[Kommando Nowotny]] unit by the end of September 1944. In action, the Me 163 proved to be [[Hypergolic propellant#History|more dangerous to the Luftwaffe]] than to the Allies, and was never a serious threat. The Me 262A was a serious threat, but attacks on their airfields neutralized them. The pioneering [[Junkers Jumo 004]] [[Axial compressor|axial-flow]] [[Turbojet|jet engine]]s of the Me 262As needed careful nursing by their pilots, and these aircraft were particularly vulnerable during takeoff and landing.<ref>Forsyth 1996, pp. 149, 194.</ref> Lt. [[Chuck Yeager]] of the [[357th Fighter Group]] was one of the first American pilots to shoot down an Me 262, which he caught during its landing approach. On 7 October 1944, Lt. [[Urban L.

[[Hubert Zemke]], who had transferred to the Mustang-equipped [[479th Fighter Group]], shot down what he thought was a Bf 109, only to have his gun camera film reveal that it may have been an Me 262.<ref>Scutts 1994, p. 58.</ref> On 25 February 1945, Mustangs of the [[55th Fighter Group]] surprised an entire [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Staffel|''Staffel'']] of Me 262As at takeoff and destroyed six jets.<ref>[[Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft]], p. 12.</ref>\n\nThe Mustang also proved useful against the [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]]s launched toward London. P-51B/Cs using 150-octane fuel were fast enough to catch the V-1 and operated in concert with shorter-range aircraft such as advanced marks of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Tempest]].\n\nBy 8 May 1945,<ref name=\"Glancey p. 188\">Glancey 2006, p. 188.</ref> the [[United States Air Forces in Europe#Lineage|8th]], [[USAFCENT#Ninth Air Force 1943 to June 1944|9th]], and [[15th Expeditionary Mobility Task Force|15th Air Force]]'s P-51 groups {{#tag:ref|All but three of these FGs flew P-38s, P-40s or P-47s before converting to the Mustang.|group=nb}} claimed some 4,950 aircraft shot down (about half of all USAAF claims in the European theater, the most claimed by any Allied fighter in air-to-air combat)<ref name=\"Glancey p. 188\" /> and 4,131 destroyed on the ground.

The top Mustang ace was the USAAF's [[George Preddy]], whose final tally stood at 26.83 victories (a number that includes shared one half- and one third victory credits), 23 of which were scored with the P-51.

These Mustangs were provided to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Fighter Groups and used to attack Japanese targets in occupied areas of China. The P-51 became the most capable fighter in China, while the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] used the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] ''Hayate'' against it.\n\nThe P-51 was a relative latecomer to the Pacific Theater, due largely to the need for the aircraft in Europe, although the P-38's twin-engined design was considered a safety advantage for long, over-water flights. The first P-51s were deployed in the Far East later in 1944, operating in close-support and escort missions, as well as tactical photo reconnaissance. As the war in Europe wound down, the P-51 became more common; eventually, with the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|capture of Iwo Jima]], it was able to be used as a bomber escort during [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] missions [[Air raids on Japan|against the Japanese homeland]].\n\nThe P-51 was often mistaken for the Japanese [[Kawasaki Ki-61]] ''Hien'' in both China and Pacific because of its similar appearance.\n\n===Pilot observations===\nChief Naval Test Pilot and C.O.

It was also the best American dogfighter. But the laminar-flow wing fitted to the Mustang could be a little tricky. It could not by any means out-turn a Spitfire. No way. It had a good rate-of-roll, better than the Spitfire, so I would say the plusses to the Spitfire and the Mustang just about equate. If I were in a dogfight, I'd prefer to be flying the Spitfire. The problem was I wouldn't like to be in a dogfight near Berlin, because I could never get home to Britain in a Spitfire!\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7PeDPQAACAAJ |isbn=978-1-903223-98-7 |page=233 |title=Air Combat Manoeuvres: The Technique and History of Air Fighting for Flight Simulation |last1=Thompson |first1=Steve |last2=Smith |first2=Peter C. |last3=Allan |first3=Ian |last4=Spinetta |first4=Lawrence J. |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Air Forces, Flight Test Engineering, assessed the Mustang B on 24 April 1944 thus: \"The rate of climb is good and the high speed in level flight is exceptionally good at all altitudes, from sea level to 40,000 feet.

As the more advanced ([[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|P-80]] and [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|P-84]]) jet fighters were introduced, the P-51 was also relegated to secondary duties.\n\nIn 1947, the newly formed [[USAF]] [[Strategic Air Command]] employed Mustangs alongside F-6 Mustangs and [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang|F-82 Twin Mustang]]s, due to their range capabilities. In 1948, the designation P-51 (P for pursuit) was changed to '''F-51''' (F for fighter) and the existing F designator for photographic reconnaissance aircraft was dropped because of a new designation scheme throughout the USAF. Aircraft still in service in the USAF or [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) when the system was changed included: '''F-51B''', '''F-51D''', '''F-51K''', '''RF-51D''' (formerly '''F-6D'''), '''RF-51K''' (formerly '''F-6K''') and '''TRF-51D''' (two-seat trainer conversions of F-6Ds). They remained in service from 1946 through 1951. By 1950, although Mustangs continued in service with the USAF after the war, the majority of the USAF's Mustangs had become surplus to requirements and placed in storage, while some were transferred to the [[Air Force Reserve]] and the ANG.\n\n[[File:F-51 in Puddle, Korean War.jpg|right|thumb|An F-51 Mustang, laden with bombs and rockets, taxis through a puddle at an airbase in Korea.]]\nFrom the start of the [[Korean War]], the Mustang once again proved useful. A \"substantial number\" of stored or in-service F-51Ds were shipped, via aircraft carriers, to the combat zone, and were used by the USAF, the South African Air Force, and the [[Republic of Korea Air Force]] (ROKAF). The F-51 was used for ground attack, fitted with rockets and bombs, and photo reconnaissance, rather than being as interceptors or \"pure\" fighters. After the first North Korean invasion, USAF units were forced to fly from bases in Japan and the F-51Ds, with their long range and endurance, could attack targets in Korea that short-ranged F-80 jets could not. Because of the vulnerable liquid cooling system, however, the F-51s sustained heavy losses to ground fire.<ref name=\"NMUSAF\" /> Due to its lighter structure and a shortage of spare parts, the newer, faster F-51H was not used in Korea.\n\nMustangs continued flying with USAF and ROKAF fighter-bomber units on close support and interdiction missions in Korea until 1953, when they were largely replaced as fighter-bombers by USAF F-84s and by [[United States Navy]] (USN) [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s. Other air forces and units using the Mustang included the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadron]], which flew Australian-built Mustangs as part of [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]]. The Mustangs were replaced by [[Gloster Meteor]] F8s in 1951. The [[South African Air Force]]'s [[No. 2 Squadron SAAF|2 Squadron]] used U.S.-built Mustangs as part of the [[18th Wing|U.S. 18th Fighter Bomber Wing]] and had suffered heavy losses by 1953, after which 2 Squadron converted to the F-86 Sabre.\n\nF-51s flew in the [[Air Force Reserve]] and ANG throughout the 1950s. The last American USAF Mustang was F-51D-30-NA AF serial no. 44-74936, which was finally withdrawn from service with the [[West Virginia Air National Guard]]'s [[167th Airlift Squadron|167th Fighter Interceptor Squadron]] in January 1957 and retired to what was then called the Air Force Central Museum,<ref>United Press, \"Last of Prop Fighters Will Go to Museum\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Saturday 26 January 1957, Volume LXIII, Number 127, page 22.</ref> although it was briefly reactivated to fly at the 50th anniversary of the Air Force Aerial Firepower Demonstration at the Air Proving Ground, [[Eglin AFB]], Florida, on 6 May 1957.<ref>\"'Mustang' Taken Out of Mothballs For Demonstration\".

Note: postwar \"uncuffed\" propeller unit.]]\nThe final withdrawal of the Mustang from USAF dumped hundreds of P-51s onto the civilian market. The rights to the Mustang design were purchased from North American by the [[Cavalier Aircraft]] Corporation, which attempted to market the surplus Mustang aircraft in the U.S. and overseas. In 1967 and again in 1972, the USAF procured batches of remanufactured Mustangs from Cavalier, most of them destined for air forces in South America and Asia that were participating in the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act|Military Assistance Program]] (MAP). These aircraft were remanufactured from existing original F-51D airframes fitted with new V-1650-7 engines, a new radio, tall F-51H-type vertical tails, and a stronger wing that could carry six {{convert|0.50|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} machine guns and a total of eight underwing hardpoints. Two {{convert|1,000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bombs and six {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} rockets could be carried. They all had an original F-51D-type canopy, but carried a second seat for an observer behind the pilot. One additional Mustang was a two-seat, dual-control TF-51D (67-14866) with an enlarged canopy and only four wing guns. Although these remanufactured Mustangs were intended for sale to South American and Asian nations through the MAP, they were delivered to the USAF with full USAF markings. They were, however, allocated new serial numbers (67-14862/14866, 67-22579/22582 and 72-1526/1541).<ref name= \"Gunston P-51\" />\n\nThe last U.S. military use of the F-51 was in 1968, when the U. S. Army employed a vintage F-51D (44-72990) as a chase aircraft for the [[AH-56 Cheyenne|Lockheed YAH-56 Cheyenne]] armed helicopter project. This aircraft was so successful that the Army ordered two F-51Ds from Cavalier in 1968 for use at [[Fort Rucker]] as chase planes. They were assigned the serials 68-15795 and 68-15796. These F-51s had wingtip fuel tanks and were unarmed. Following the end of the Cheyenne program, these two chase aircraft were used for other projects. One of them (68-15795) was fitted with a 106&nbsp;mm recoilless rifle for evaluation of the weapon's value in attacking fortified ground targets.<ref>Wixey 2001, p. 55.</ref> Cavalier Mustang 68-15796 survives at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]], [[Eglin AFB]], Florida, displayed indoors in World War II markings.\n\nThe F-51 was adopted by many foreign air forces and continued to be an effective fighter into the mid-1980s with smaller air arms. The last Mustang ever downed in battle occurred during [[Operation Power Pack]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1965, with the last aircraft finally being retired by the Dominican Air Force in 1984.<ref>[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_153.shtml \"Dominican Republic.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829114424/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_153.shtml |date=29 August 2006 }} ''acig.org.''

Handling had to be done with much care when fuel tanks were fully used, and several aerobatic maneuvers were forbidden. Overall, the P-51D was highly rated even compared to the other primary postwar fighter in Italian service, the Supermarine Spitfire, partly because these P-51Ds were in very good condition in contrast to all other Allied fighters supplied to Italy.

{"title_page": "Foregrounding", "text_new": "'''Foregrounding''' is a concept in literary studies concerning making a linguistic utterance ( word, clause, phrase, phoneme, etc.) stand out from the surrounding linguistic context, from a given literary traditions or from more general world knowledge.<ref>Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.</ref> It is \"the 'throwing into relief' of the linguistic sign against the background of the norms of ordinary language.\"<ref>Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd. p157</ref> The term originated in English through the translation by Paul Garvin of of the [[Czech (language)|Czech]] ''aktualisace'' (literally \"to actualise\"), borrowing the terms from [[Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd]] of the [[Prague school]] of the 1930s.<ref>Martin Proch\u00e1zka (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9a9nhXQUKEC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Prague%20School%20and%20Theories%20of%20Structure&hl=es&pg=PA196#v=onepage&q&f=false The Prague School and Theories of Structure]'' p.196 footnote 4.</ref>\n\nThere are two main types of foregrounding: [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and deviation. Parallelism can be described as unexpected regularity, while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity.<ref>Leech, G. (1969) ''A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry''. Longman</ref> As the definition of foregrounding indicates, these are relative concepts. Something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a 'secondary norm'<ref>Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.</ref>) or wider such as an entire genre (referred to as a 'primary norm'<ref>Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.</ref>).\n\nFor example, the last line of a poem with a consistent metre may be foregrounded by changing the number of syllables it contains. This would be an example of a deviation from a secondary norm. In the following poem by [[E. E. Cummings]],<ref>as quoted in Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.)

Parallelism can be described as unexpected regularity, while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity.<ref>Leech, G. (1969) ''A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry''. Longman</ref> As the definition of foregrounding indicates, these are relative concepts. Something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a 'secondary norm'<ref>Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.</ref>) or wider such as an entire genre (referred to as a 'primary norm'<ref>Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.</ref>).\n\nFor example, the last line of a poem with a consistent metre may be foregrounded by changing the number of syllables it contains. This would be an example of a deviation from a secondary norm. In the following poem by [[E. E. Cummings]],<ref>as quoted in Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.)
