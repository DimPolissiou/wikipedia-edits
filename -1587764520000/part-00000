The series stars [[Ross Lynch]], [[Laura Marano]], [[Raini Rodriguez]], and [[Calum Worthy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in [[Miami]], ''Austin & Ally'' is about the relationship between two very different musicians: extroverted and fun-loving singer and instrumentalist Austin Moon, and introverted and awkward songwriter Ally Dawson, who is also a singer, but has a bad case of stage fright.\n\nIn \"[[List of Austin & Ally episodes#ep1|Rockers & Writers]]\", Austin overhears Ally singing a song she's written.  Later, he changes the tempo of the song and sings it himself, although he's completely forgotten it's the same song he heard Ally singing.  He becomes famous from it after his best friend, Dez, directs Austin in a music video for the song and posts it on the Internet, making Austin an overnight sensation. Once Ally takes credit for her song, she and Austin work together on a second song.  At the end of the episode, Austin convinces her to become his partner, and the two agree to work together and eventually become close friends. Ally's best friend, Trish, pitches in as Austin's manager and Dez continues to direct Austin's music videos. At the end of the first season, Austin gets signed to Jimmy Starr's record label.\n\nThe second season sees both Austin and Ally taking bigger steps. Ally conquers her stage fright by performing a duet with Austin. By the end of the second season, Ally signs a record deal and records an album with Ronnie Ramone, while Austin goes on his first national tour. Due to her schedule with Ronnie Ramone, Ally is unable to attend the first half of Austin's tour, but in the first two episodes of the third season, Ally does attend the second half of the tour.\n\nIn the third season, Ally's career takes off. Later, Ally is making her first album. By the end of the third season, Austin sacrifices his music career when his record label forbids him from being together with Ally. Austin chooses to be with Ally as they confess their love for each other. In the end, Austin goes with Ally on her first tour, Trish starts her own management company, and Dez goes to film school in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the fourth season, the group reunites after the tour and turns Sonic Boom into a music school called A&A Music Factory, where they help students pursue their musical dreams. They combine their talents to become business partners, and the store's success explodes.\n\nThe series has been described as a \"pint-sized\" version of [[HBO]]'s [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/teens-go-showbiz-for-disney-channel-1118028677/|title=Teens Go Showbiz for Disney Channel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Michael Schneider|date=December 8, 2010|access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n{{:List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n\n=== ''Jessie'' crossover ===\nIn November 2012, Disney Channel announced that the series would crossover with ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]'' as an hour-long special episode titled \"[[Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year]]\". The special aired on December 7, 2012, in which Austin finally gets to perform in Times Square on New Year's Eve like he has always dreamed of, with help from Jessie and the Ross children. Later, Jessie and the children travel to Miami with the group. Jessie inadvertently steals lyrics that were written by Zuri and tries to get Austin to sing them with her. Meanwhile, Ravi is jealous to see that the family's pet lizard, Mrs. Kipling, may have a crush on Dez, though it turns out that Mrs. Kipling does not like Dez at all.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<imagemap>\nFile:AustinandAllyCast.jpg|right|thumb|The main characters, from left to right: Trish, Austin Moon, Ally Dawson, and Dez.\n\nrect 31 31 82 188 [#Trish|Trish]\nrect 87 7 129 188 [#Austin Moon|Austin]\nrect 131 19 165 188 [#Ally Dawson|Ally]\nrect 170 1 212 188 [#Dez|Dez]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n\n* [Ross Lynch] as {{visible anchor|Austin Moon}}, an outgoing, confident, and talented singer. After becoming an overnight Internet sensation by performing a song he overheard Ally singing, Ally tracks him down to confront him for theft, but they eventually become friends instead and decide to form a musical partnership.

Ally is a brilliant songwriter, but is too timid to perform her own music, while Austin loves to perform, but is unable to write songs for himself. Their radically different personalities tend to clash early on, though they find they're much more alike than they think as their friendship develops, leading to an on-again, off-again romance starting in the second season. In the third season, they begin to date again and are found in a healthy, secure relationship throughout the fourth season. Austin's best friend is Dez, who directs and films all of his music videos, and his manager is Trish.

In the series finale, it is revealed that Ally is married to Austin and they have two children named Alex and Ava.\n* [[Raini Rodriguez]] as {{visible anchor|Trish}}{{anchor|Trish Del a Rosa}}{{anchor|Trish De la Rosa}},<!-- do not change these anchors, as doing so will break incoming links --> Ally's best friend and Austin's manager. She is sarcastic, snarky, lazy, vindictive, has little patience, and has a bit of a temper, but cares very much for her friends. Her jobs change frequently due to her lack of effort and presence at work. She takes her job as Austin's manager, however, fairly seriously and she also became Ally's manager when her career takes off. She has a complicated love-hate relationship with Dez. She teaches students at the A&A Music Factory about being a celebrity manager in the fourth season.\n* [[Calum Worthy]] as {{visible anchor|Dez}}{{anchor|Dez Wade}}{{anchor|Dez Hatfield Wade}},<!-- do not change these anchors, as doing so will break incoming links --> an aspiring director with an odd personality and an unusual fashion style. He films all of Austin's music videos and is Austin's best friend. He's considerably dense and lacks much logical understanding which tends to lead him and the group into messy situations. He has a complicated love-hate relationship with Trish. He teaches students at the A&A Music Factory about filming and directing music videos in the fourth season.\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Cole Sand]] as Nelson, an awkward young boy who takes music lessons from Ally. He constantly uses the phrase, \"Aww, nartz!\" and tends to mix up words that sound alike, such as \"oboe\" and \"hobo\".\n* [[Andy Milder]] as Lester Dawson, Ally's cheapskate father who owns the music store ''Sonic Boom''. He is completely ignorant of Ally's musical talents and believes that Ally has a billion-to-one shot at making it in the music business, just like Austin's parents have told him. He and Penny, Ally's mother, are divorced.\n* Richard Whiten as Jimmy Starr, the owner of Starr Records who signs Austin to his record label.\n* Aubrey Miller as Megan Simms, a 10-year-old reporter and photographer for Cheetah Beat Magazine. Megan is eccentric and constantly uses teenage slang terms such as \"totes\" or \"hilar\".

Kira temporarily had a case of repugnant breath, causing the group to be extremely wary of her throughout \"[[List of Austin & Ally episodes#ep26|Ferris Wheels & Funky Breath]]\". Her bad breath was caused by her constant eating of garlic and anchovy pizza. Her bad breath cleared away afterward.\n* John Paul Green as Chuck, a short, country-speaking teenager who believes he is better than Dez at everything. Their rivalry follows a long history of their families feuding, so Chuck and Dez often get into similar battles. He usually wears cowboy attire.\n* [[Ashley Fink]] as Mindy, the manager of The Melody Diner and has a crush on Dez. Dez himself has no interest in her and is more intimidated by her than anything, as Mindy is overbearing and aggressive.\n* Joe Rowley as Ronnie Ramone, the owner of Ramone Records, who signs Ally to his record label.\n* Hannah Kat Jones as Carrie, a waitress at Shredder's Beach Club, Piper's sister, and Dez's girlfriend. She broke up with him in Los Angeles, but they got back together in \"[[List of Austin & Ally episodes#ep74|Wedding Bells & Wacky Birds]]\".\n* [[Hayley Erin]] as Piper, Carrie's sister and Austin's ex-girlfriend.\n* [[Cameron Deane Stewart]] as Jace, a boy who Trish met when she was on tour and Trish's long-distance boyfriend.\n* Cameron Jebo as Gavin Young, a country performer and Ally's ex-boyfriend.\n\n== Production ==\nThe series was created by [[Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert]], the writers and producers of the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] comedy series ''[[All That]]'' and the Disney Channel sitcoms ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'' and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]''.

The series stars [[Ross Lynch]], [[Laura Marano]], [[Raini Rodriguez]], and [[Calum Worthy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in [[Miami]], ''Austin & Ally'' is about the relationship between two very different musicians: extroverted and fun-loving singer and instrumentalist Austin Moon, and introverted and awkward songwriter Ally Dawson, who is also a singer, but has a bad case of stage fright.\n\nIn \"[[List of Austin & Ally episodes#ep1|Rockers & Writers]]\", Austin overhears Ally singing a song she's written.  Later, he changes the tempo of the song and sings it himself, although he's completely forgotten it's the same song he heard Ally singing.  He becomes famous from it after his best friend, Dez, directs Austin in a music video for the song and posts it on the Internet, making Austin an overnight sensation. Once Ally takes credit for her song, she and Austin work together on a second song.  At the end of the episode, Austin convinces her to become his partner, and the two agree to work together and eventually become close friends. Ally's best friend, Trish, pitches in as Austin's manager and Dez continues to direct Austin's music videos. At the end of the first season, Austin gets signed to Jimmy Starr's record label.\n\nThe second season sees both Austin and Ally taking bigger steps. Ally conquers her stage fright by performing a duet with Austin. By the end of the second season, Ally signs a record deal and records an album with Ronnie Ramone, while Austin goes on his first national tour. Due to her schedule with Ronnie Ramone, Ally is unable to attend the first half of Austin's tour, but in the first two episodes of the third season, Ally does attend the second half of the tour.\n\nIn the third season, Ally's career takes off. Later, Ally is making her first album. By the end of the third season, Austin sacrifices his music career when his record label forbids him from being together with Ally. Austin chooses to be with Ally as they confess their love for each other. In the end, Austin goes with Ally on her first tour, Trish starts her own management company, and Dez goes to film school in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the fourth season, the group reunites after the tour and turns Sonic Boom into a music school called A&A Music Factory, where they help students pursue their musical dreams. They combine their talents to become business partners, and the store's success explodes.\n\nThe series has been described as a \"pint-sized\" version of [[HBO]]'s [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/tv/news/teens-go-showbiz-for-disney-channel-1118028677/|title=Teens Go Showbiz for Disney Channel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Michael Schneider|date=December 8, 2010|access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n{{:List of Austin & Ally episodes}}\n\n=== ''Jessie'' crossover ===\nIn November 2012, Disney Channel announced that the series would crossover with ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]'' as an hour-long special episode titled \"[[Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year]]\". The special aired on December 7, 2012, in which Austin finally gets to perform in Times Square on New Year's Eve like he has always dreamed of, with help from Jessie and the Ross children. Later, Jessie and the children travel to Miami with the group. Jessie inadvertently steals lyrics that were written by Zuri and tries to get Austin to sing them with her. Meanwhile, Ravi is jealous to see that the family's pet lizard, Mrs. Kipling, may have a crush on Dez, though it turns out that Mrs. Kipling does not like Dez at all.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<imagemap>\nFile:AustinandAllyCast.jpg|right|thumb|The main characters, from left to right: Trish, Austin Moon, Ally Dawson, and Dez.\n\nrect 31 31 82 188 [[#Trish|Trish]]\nrect 87 7 129 188 [[#Austin Moon|Austin]]\nrect 131 19 165 188 [[#Ally Dawson|Ally]]\nrect 170 1 212 188 [[#Dez|Dez]]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n\n* [[Ross Lynch]] as {{visible anchor|Austin Moon}}, an outgoing, confident, and talented singer. After becoming an overnight Internet sensation by performing a song he overheard Ally singing, Ally tracks him down to confront him for theft, but they eventually become friends instead and decide to form a musical partnership. His partnership with Ally is initially built on the idea that \"he rocks; she writes\". Ally is a brilliant songwriter, but is too timid to perform her own music, while Austin loves to perform, but is unable to write songs for himself. Their radically different personalities tend to clash early on, though they find they're much more alike than they think as their friendship develops, leading to an on-again, off-again romance starting in the second season. In the third season, they begin to date again and are found in a healthy, secure relationship throughout the fourth season. Austin's best friend is Dez, who directs and films all of his music videos, and his manager is Trish.

In the series finale, it is revealed that Austin is married to Ally and they have two children named Alex and Ava.\n* [[Laura Marano]] as {{visible anchor|Ally Dawson}}, a smart girl and a singer-songwriter with severe stage fright and a quiet, shy personality.

She is sarcastic, snarky, lazy, vindictive, has little patience, and has a bit of a temper, but cares very much for her friends.

The script is used for other languages like [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri]] and has historically been used to write [[Sanskrit]] within [[Bengal]]. There are a total 50 letters, 11 vowels and 39 consonants.\n\nFrom a [[Writing system#Functional classification of writing systems|classificatory point of view]], the Bengali script is an [[abugida]], i.e. its vowel [[graphemes]] are mainly realised not as independent letters, but as [[diacritic]]s modifying the [[inherent vowel|vowel inherent]] in the base letter they are added to. Bengali script is written from left to right and has no distinct [[letter case]]s. It is recognisable, as are other [[Brahmic scripts]], by a distinctive horizontal line known as {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}}, ''matra'' running along the tops of the letters that links them together. The Bengali script is however less blocky and presents a more sinuous shape.<ref name=georgec>George Cardona and Danesh Jain (2003), The Indo-Aryan Languages, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772945}}</ref> {{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=Less blocky and more sinuous than what? Several Brahmic scripts (e.g. Burmese, Malayalam and Odia) are quite sinuous. Reference addition May 2018: probably quoted from this; see article Devanagari, intro part.}}\n\n==History==\nThe Bengali script evolved from the [[Siddham script]] or kutil lipi, which belongs to the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic family]] of scripts. In addition to differences in how the letters are pronounced in the different languages, there are some typographical differences between the version of the script used for [[Assamese language]] and that used for [[Bengali language]]:\n* ''r\u00f4'' is represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali, and as {{lang|bn|\u09f0}} in Assamese.\n* Assamese script has a character, ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}; in Bengali it was represented as {{lang|bn|\u09ac}}, same as ''b\u00f4'', and was called {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}} ''\u00f4nt\u00f4sth\u00f4 b\u00f4'', to differentiate it from the other b\u00f4 called {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} ''b\u00f4rgiy\u00f4 b\u00f4'' but it lost its distinctive sound over the course of time (and was pronounced just like {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}}) and recently, it was merged with {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} (though difference is still found in form of {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la'', which is the diacritic form of {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}}) especially due to both being represented by the same letter.\n\nThe version of the script used for Manipuri is also a different variation; it uses the ''r\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali script without the different representation as in Assamese script. It also uses the Assamese script character sounding ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}.\n\nThe Bengali script was originally not associated with any particular language but was often used in the eastern regions of the [[Middle kingdoms of India]] and then in the [[Pala Empire]]. It later continued to be specifically used in the [[History of Bengal|Bengal region]]. It was later standardised into the modern Bengali script by [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] under the reign of the [[East India Company]]. Today, the script holds official script status in [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]], and it is associated with the daily life of [[Bengalis]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe Bengali script can be divided into vowels and vowel diacritics/marks, consonants and consonant conjuncts, diacritical and other symbols, digits, and punctuation marks. Vowels & consonants are used as alphabet and also as diacritical marks. \n\n===Vowels===\nThe Bengali script has a total of 9 vowel [[graphemes]], each of which is called a {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'' \"vowel letter\". The ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4''s represent six of the seven [[Bengali phonology#Consonants and vowels|main vowel sounds]] of Bengali, along with two vowel [[Bengali phonology#Diphthongs|diphthongs]]. All of them are used in both Bengali and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] languages.\n* \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\" ''\u00f4'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0985}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 \u00f4'', \"vocalic \u00f4\") {{IPA|/\u0254/}} sounds as the default [[inherent vowel]] for the entire Bengali script.\n* Even though the [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is one of the seven main vowel sounds in the standard Bengali language, no distinct vowel symbol has been allotted for it in the script since there is no {{IPA|/\u025b/}} sound in Sanskrit, the primary written language when the script was conceived. As a result, the sound is orthographically realised by multiple means in modern Bengali orthography, usually using some combination of \"{{lang|bn|\u098f}}\" ''e'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u098f}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 e'', \"vocalic e\") {{IPA|/e/}}, \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\", \"{{lang|bn|\u0986}}\" ''a'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0986}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 a'') {{IPA|/a/}} and the {{lang|bn|\u09af\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'' (diacritic form of the consonant grapheme {{lang|bn|\u09af}} ''j\u00f4'').\n* There are two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[i]}} and two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[u]}}. The redundancy stems from the time when this script was used to write [[Sanskrit]], a language that had short and long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u0987}}\" ''i'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0987}} r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 i'', \"short i\") {{IPA|/i/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0988}}\" ''\u012b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u0988 dirgh\u00f4 \u012b'', \"long \u012b\") {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and \"{{lang|bn|\u0989}}\" ''u'' (''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0989 r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 u'') {{IPA|/u/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u098a}}\" ''\u016b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u098a dirgh\u00f4 \u016b'') {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. The letters are preserved in the Bengali script with their traditional names despite the fact that they are no longer pronounced differently in ordinary speech. These graphemes serve an etymological function, however, in preserving the original Sanskrit spelling in ''[[Tatsama|t\u00f4ts\u00f4m\u00f4]]'' Bengali words (words borrowed from Sanskrit).\n* The grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\" ''\u1e5b'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098b r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 ri'', \"short ri\", as it used to be) does not really represent a vowel phoneme in Bengali but the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09bf}} {{IPA|/ri/}}. Nevertheless, it is included in the vowel section of the inventory of the Bengali script. This inconsistency is also a remnant from [[Sanskrit]], where the grapheme represents the [[vocalic]] equivalent of a [[retroflex approximant]] (possibly an [[r-colored vowel]]). Another grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098c}}\" ''\u1e37'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098c r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 li'' as it used to be) representing the vocalic equivalent of a [[dental approximant]] in Sanskrit but actually representing the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09bf}} {{IPA|/li/}} in Bengali instead of a vowel phoneme, was also included in the vowel section but unlike \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\", it was recently discarded from the inventory since its usage was extremely limited even in Sanskrit.\n* When a vowel sound occurs syllable-initially or when it follows another vowel, it is written using a distinct letter. When a vowel sound follows a consonant (or a consonant cluster), it is written with a diacritic which, depending on the vowel, can appear above, below, before or after the consonant. These vowel marks cannot appear without a consonant and are called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar''.\n* An exception to the above system is the vowel {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, which has no vowel mark but is considered inherent in every consonant letter. To denote the absence of the inherent vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} following a consonant, a diacritic called the {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4}} ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'' (\u09cd) may be written underneath the consonant.\n* Although there are only two diphthongs in the inventory of the script: \"{{lang|bn|\u0990}}\" ''oi'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0990 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 oi'', \"vocalic oi\") {{IPA|/oi/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0994}}\" ''ou'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0994 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 ou'') {{IPA|/ou/}}, the Bengali phonetic system has, in fact, many diphthongs.<ref group=\"nb\">Different Bengali linguists give different numbers of Bengali diphthongs in their works depending on methodology, e.g. 25 (Chatterji 1939: 40), 31 (Hai 1964), 45 (Ashraf and Ashraf 1966: 49), 28 (Kostic and Das 1972:6\u20137) and 17 (Sarkar 1987).</ref> Most diphthongs are represented by juxtaposing the graphemes of their forming vowels, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09c7\u0989}} ''keu'' {{IPA|/keu/}}.\n* There also used to be two long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u09e0}}\" ''\u1e5d'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e0 dirgh\u00f4 rri'', \"long rri\") and \"{{lang|bn|\u09e1}}\" ''\u1e39'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e1 dirgh\u00f4 lli''), which were [[Spelling reform|removed]] from the inventory during the [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar#Bengali alphabet and language reconstruction|Vidyasagarian reform]] of the script due to peculiarity to Sanskrit.\n\nThe table below shows the vowels present in the modern (since the late nineteenth century) inventory of the Bengali alphabet:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|-\n|+ '''Bengali vowels<br/>({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sb\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'')'''\n|-\n!\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac}} ([[Short vowel|short]])\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998}} ([[Long vowel|long]])\n|-\n!\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark)\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark) \n|-\n!''\u0995\u09a8\u09cd\u09a0\u09cd\u09af''<br />(Guttural)\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u0985\n| {{transl|bn|\u00f4}}<br />/{{IPAlink|\u0254}}~{{IPAlink|o}}/<ref name=\"inherent\" group=\"nc\">The natural pronunciation of the grapheme \u0985, whether in its independent (visible) form or in its \"inherent\" (invisible) form in a consonant grapheme, is {{IPA|/\u0254/}}.

Typically, the first consonant in the conjunct is shown above and/or to the left of the following consonants. Many consonants appear in an abbreviated or compressed form when serving as part of a conjunct. Others simply take exceptional forms in conjuncts, bearing little or no resemblance to the base character.\n\nOften, consonant conjuncts are not actually pronounced as would be implied by the pronunciation of the individual components. For example, adding {{lang|bn|\u09b2}} ''l\u00f4'' underneath {{lang|bn|\u09b6}} ''sh\u00f4'' in Bengali creates the conjunct {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u09b2}}, which is not pronounced ''shl\u00f4'' but ''sl\u00f4'' in Bengali. Many conjuncts represent Sanskrit sounds that were lost centuries before modern Bengali was ever spoken as in {{lang|bn|\u099c\u09cd\u099e}}.

Bengali numerals have no horizontal headstroke or \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be \"matra\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n|-\n!

A period or dot is used to denote the [[decimal separator]], which separates the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal number. When writing large numbers with many digits, commas are used as delimiters to [[Decimal separator#Digit grouping|group]] digits, indicating the [[thousand]] (\u09b9\u09be\u099c\u09be\u09b0 ''hazar''), the [[hundred thousand]] or [[lakh]] (\u09b2\u09be\u0996 ''lakh'' or \u09b2\u0995\u09cd\u09b7 ''l\u00f4kkh\u00f4''), and the ten million or hundred lakh or [[crore]] (\u0995\u09cb\u099f\u09bf ''koti'') units. In other words, leftwards from the decimal separator, the first grouping consists of three digits, and the subsequent groupings always consist of two digits.\n\nFor example, the English number 17,557,345 will be written in traditional Bengali as \u09e7,\u09ed\u09eb,\u09eb\u09ed,\u09e9\u09ea\u09eb.\n\n===Punctuation marks===\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke \u09a6\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf ''dari'' (\u0964), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar: commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, etc. are the same as in English. Capital letters are absent in the Bengali script so proper names are unmarked.\n\nAn apostrophe, known in Bengali as \u098a\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u0995\u09ae\u09be ''urdhb\u00f4k\u00f4ma'' \"upper comma\", is sometimes used to distinguish between [[homograph]]s, as in \u09aa\u09be\u099f\u09be ''pata'' \"plank\" and \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be ''pa'ta'' \"the leg\". Sometimes, a hyphen is used for the same purpose (as in \u09aa\u09be-\u099f\u09be, an alternative of \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be).\n\n===Characteristics of the Bengali text===\n[[File:Tagore handwriting Bengali.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An example of handwritten Bengali script. Part of a poem written by Nobel Laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] in 1926 in Hungary.]]\n\nBengali text is written and read horizontally, from left to right. The consonant graphemes and the full form of vowel graphemes fit into an imaginary rectangle of uniform size (uniform width and height). The size of a consonant conjunct, regardless of its complexity, is deliberately maintained the same as that of a single consonant grapheme, so that diacritic vowel forms can be attached to it without any distortion. In a typical Bengali text, orthographic words, words as they are written, can be seen as being separated from each other by an even spacing. Graphemes within a word are also evenly spaced, but that spacing is much narrower than the spacing between words.\n\nUnlike in western scripts ([[Latin script|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], etc.) for which the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter \u09a4 ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral \u09e9 \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel \u098f ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\n{| class = wikitable style=\"float:right; margin:0.5em; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Grapheme !!

While efforts at standardising the alphabet for the Bengali language continue in such notable centres as the [[Bangla Academy]] at [[Dhaka]] (Bangladesh) and the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi|P\u00f4shchimb\u00f4ngg\u00f4 Bangla Akademi]] at [[Kolkata]] ([[West Bengal]], India), it is still not quite uniform, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters, resulting in concurrent forms for the same sounds. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Assamese and Bengali variations exist today in the formalised system.\n\nIt seems likely that [[standardisation]] of the alphabet will be greatly influenced by the need to typeset it on computers. The large alphabet can be represented, with a great deal of ingenuity, within the [[ASCII]] character set, omitting certain irregular conjuncts. Work has been underway since around 2001 to develop [[Unicode]] [[fonts]], and it seems likely that it will split into two variants, traditional and modern. In this and other articles on Wikipedia dealing with the Bengali language, a [[Romanization of Bengali|Romanization]] scheme used by linguists specialising in [[Bengali phonology]] is included along with [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription. A recent effort by the [[Government of West Bengal]] focused on simplifying the Bengali orthography in primary school texts.\n\nThere is still no uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for the problem.\n\n==Romanization==\n{{Main|Romanization of Bengali}}\n\nRomanization of Bengali is the representation of the [[Bengali language]] in the [[Latin script]]. There are various ways of Romanization systems of Bengali, created in recent years but failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound.

The script is used for other languages like [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri]] and has historically been used to write [[Sanskrit]] within [[Bengal]]. There are a total 50 letters, 11 vowels and 39 consonants.\n\nFrom a [[Writing system#Functional classification of writing systems|classificatory point of view]], the Bengali script is an [[abugida]], i.e. its vowel [[graphemes]] are mainly realised not as independent letters, but as [[diacritic]]s modifying the [[inherent vowel|vowel inherent]] in the base letter they are added to. Bengali script is written from left to right and has no distinct [[letter case]]s. It is recognisable, as are other [[Brahmic scripts]], by a distinctive horizontal line known as {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}}, ''matra'' running along the tops of the letters that links them together. The Bengali script is however less blocky and presents a more sinuous shape.<ref name=georgec>George Cardona and Danesh Jain (2003), The Indo-Aryan Languages, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772945}}</ref> {{clarify|date=November 2015|reason=Less blocky and more sinuous than what? Several Brahmic scripts (e.g. Burmese, Malayalam and Odia) are quite sinuous. Reference addition May 2018: probably quoted from this; see article Devanagari, intro part.}}\n\n==History==\nThe Bengali script evolved from the [[Siddham script]] or kutil lipi, which belongs to the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic family]] of scripts. In addition to differences in how the letters are pronounced in the different languages, there are some typographical differences between the version of the script used for [[Assamese language]] and that used for [[Bengali language]]:\n* ''r\u00f4'' is represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali, and as {{lang|bn|\u09f0}} in Assamese.\n* Assamese script has a character, ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}; in Bengali it was represented as {{lang|bn|\u09ac}}, same as ''b\u00f4'', and was called {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}} ''\u00f4nt\u00f4sth\u00f4 b\u00f4'', to differentiate it from the other b\u00f4 called {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} ''b\u00f4rgiy\u00f4 b\u00f4'' but it lost its distinctive sound over the course of time (and was pronounced just like {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}}) and recently, it was merged with {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09ac}} (though difference is still found in form of {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''b\u00f4f\u00f4la'', which is the diacritic form of {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u0983\u09b8\u09cd\u09a5 \u09ac}}) especially due to both being represented by the same letter.\n\nThe version of the script used for Manipuri is also a different variation; it uses the ''r\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09b0}} in Bengali script without the different representation as in Assamese script. It also uses the Assamese script character sounding ''w\u00f4'', represented as {{lang|bn|\u09f1}}.\n\nThe Bengali script was originally not associated with any particular language but was often used in the eastern regions of the [[Middle kingdoms of India]] and then in the [[Pala Empire]]. It later continued to be specifically used in the [[History of Bengal|Bengal region]]. It was later standardised into the modern Bengali script by [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] under the reign of the [[East India Company]]. Today, the script holds official script status in [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]], and it is associated with the daily life of [[Bengalis]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe Bengali script can be divided into vowels and vowel diacritics/marks, consonants and consonant conjuncts, diacritical and other symbols, digits, and punctuation marks. Vowels & consonants are used as alphabet and also as diacritical marks. \n\n===Vowels===\nThe Bengali script has a total of 9 vowel [[graphemes]], each of which is called a {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'' \"vowel letter\". The ''sw\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4''s represent six of the seven [[Bengali phonology#Consonants and vowels|main vowel sounds]] of Bengali, along with two vowel [[Bengali phonology#Diphthongs|diphthongs]]. All of them are used in both Bengali and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] languages.\n* \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\" ''\u00f4'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0985}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 \u00f4'', \"vocalic \u00f4\") {{IPA|/\u0254/}} sounds as the default [[inherent vowel]] for the entire Bengali script.\n* Even though the [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is one of the seven main vowel sounds in the standard Bengali language, no distinct vowel symbol has been allotted for it in the script since there is no {{IPA|/\u025b/}} sound in Sanskrit, the primary written language when the script was conceived. As a result, the sound is orthographically realised by multiple means in modern Bengali orthography, usually using some combination of \"{{lang|bn|\u098f}}\" ''e'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u098f}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 e'', \"vocalic e\") {{IPA|/e/}}, \"{{lang|bn|\u0985}}\", \"{{lang|bn|\u0986}}\" ''a'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0986}} sh\u00f4r\u00f4 a'') {{IPA|/a/}} and the {{lang|bn|\u09af\u09ab\u09b2\u09be}} ''j\u00f4f\u00f4la'' (diacritic form of the consonant grapheme {{lang|bn|\u09af}} ''j\u00f4'').\n* There are two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[i]}} and two graphemes for the vowel sound {{IPA|[u]}}. The redundancy stems from the time when this script was used to write [[Sanskrit]], a language that had short and long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u0987}}\" ''i'' (''{{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0987}} r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 i'', \"short i\") {{IPA|/i/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0988}}\" ''\u012b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u0988 dirgh\u00f4 \u012b'', \"long \u012b\") {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, and \"{{lang|bn|\u0989}}\" ''u'' (''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u0989 r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 u'') {{IPA|/u/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u098a}}\" ''\u016b'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u098a dirgh\u00f4 \u016b'') {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. The letters are preserved in the Bengali script with their traditional names despite the fact that they are no longer pronounced differently in ordinary speech. These graphemes serve an etymological function, however, in preserving the original Sanskrit spelling in ''[[Tatsama|t\u00f4ts\u00f4m\u00f4]]'' Bengali words (words borrowed from Sanskrit).\n* The grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\" ''\u1e5b'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098b r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 ri'', \"short ri\", as it used to be) does not really represent a vowel phoneme in Bengali but the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09bf}} {{IPA|/ri/}}. Nevertheless, it is included in the vowel section of the inventory of the Bengali script. This inconsistency is also a remnant from [[Sanskrit]], where the grapheme represents the [[vocalic]] equivalent of a [[retroflex approximant]] (possibly an [[r-colored vowel]]). Another grapheme called \"{{lang|bn|\u098c}}\" ''\u1e37'' (or ''\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac \u098c r\u00f4shsh\u00f4 li'' as it used to be) representing the vocalic equivalent of a [[dental approximant]] in Sanskrit but actually representing the consonant-vowel combination {{lang|bn|\u09b2\u09bf}} {{IPA|/li/}} in Bengali instead of a vowel phoneme, was also included in the vowel section but unlike \"{{lang|bn|\u098b}}\", it was recently discarded from the inventory since its usage was extremely limited even in Sanskrit.\n* When a vowel sound occurs syllable-initially or when it follows another vowel, it is written using a distinct letter. When a vowel sound follows a consonant (or a consonant cluster), it is written with a diacritic which, depending on the vowel, can appear above, below, before or after the consonant. These vowel marks cannot appear without a consonant and are called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar''.\n* An exception to the above system is the vowel {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, which has no vowel mark but is considered inherent in every consonant letter. To denote the absence of the inherent vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} following a consonant, a diacritic called the {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4}} ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'' (\u09cd) may be written underneath the consonant.\n* Although there are only two diphthongs in the inventory of the script: \"{{lang|bn|\u0990}}\" ''oi'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0990 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 oi'', \"vocalic oi\") {{IPA|/oi/}} and \"{{lang|bn|\u0994}}\" ''ou'' (''\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 \u0994 sh\u00f4r\u00f4 ou'') {{IPA|/ou/}}, the Bengali phonetic system has, in fact, many diphthongs.<ref group=\"nb\">Different Bengali linguists give different numbers of Bengali diphthongs in their works depending on methodology, e.g. 25 (Chatterji 1939: 40), 31 (Hai 1964), 45 (Ashraf and Ashraf 1966: 49), 28 (Kostic and Das 1972:6\u20137) and 17 (Sarkar 1987).</ref> Most diphthongs are represented by juxtaposing the graphemes of their forming vowels, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09c7\u0989}} ''keu'' {{IPA|/keu/}}.\n* There also used to be two long vowels: \"{{lang|bn|\u09e0}}\" ''\u1e5d'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e0 dirgh\u00f4 rri'', \"long rri\") and \"{{lang|bn|\u09e1}}\" ''\u1e39'' (''\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998 \u09e1 dirgh\u00f4 lli''), which were [[Spelling reform|removed]] from the inventory during the [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar#Bengali alphabet and language reconstruction|Vidyasagarian reform]] of the script due to peculiarity to Sanskrit.\n\nThe table below shows the vowels present in the modern (since the late nineteenth century) inventory of the Bengali alphabet:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|-\n|+ '''Bengali vowels<br/>({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a3}} ''sb\u00f4r\u00f4b\u00f4rn\u00f4'')'''\n|-\n!\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09b9\u09cd\u09b0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac}} ([[Short vowel|short]])\n! colspan=3 style=\"background:#ccc;\" | {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09cd\u0998}} ([[Long vowel|long]])\n|-\n!\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark)\n!colspan=2|{{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel phoneme)\n!{{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}}<br/>(vowel mark) \n|-\n!''\u0995\u09a8\u09cd\u09a0\u09cd\u09af''<br />(Guttural)\n| style=\"background:#ccc; font-size:24px;\"|\u0985\n| {{transl|bn|\u00f4}}<br />/{{IPAlink|\u0254}}~{{IPAlink|o}}/<ref name=\"inherent\" group=\"nc\">The natural pronunciation of the grapheme \u0985, whether in its independent (visible) form or in its \"inherent\" (invisible) form in a consonant grapheme, is {{IPA|/\u0254/}}.

Typically, the first consonant in the conjunct is shown above and/or to the left of the following consonants. Many consonants appear in an abbreviated or compressed form when serving as part of a conjunct. Others simply take exceptional forms in conjuncts, bearing little or no resemblance to the base character.\n\nOften, consonant conjuncts are not actually pronounced as would be implied by the pronunciation of the individual components. For example, adding {{lang|bn|\u09b2}} ''l\u00f4'' underneath {{lang|bn|\u09b6}} ''sh\u00f4'' in Bengali creates the conjunct {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09cd\u09b2}}, which is not pronounced ''shl\u00f4'' but ''sl\u00f4'' in Bengali. Many conjuncts represent Sanskrit sounds that were lost centuries before modern Bengali was ever spoken as in {{lang|bn|\u099c\u09cd\u099e}}. It is a combination of {{lang|bn|\u099c}} \u01f0\u00f4 and {{lang|bn|\u099e}} \u00f1\u00f4 but it is not pronounced \"\u01f0\u00f1\u00f4\" or \"jn\u00f4\". Instead, it is pronounced ''gg\u00f4'' in modern Bengali.

Bengali numerals have no horizontal headstroke or \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be \"matra\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n|-\n!

A period or dot is used to denote the [[decimal separator]], which separates the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal number. When writing large numbers with many digits, commas are used as delimiters to [[Decimal separator#Digit grouping|group]] digits, indicating the [[thousand]] (\u09b9\u09be\u099c\u09be\u09b0 ''hazar''), the [[hundred thousand]] or [[lakh]] (\u09b2\u09be\u0996 ''lakh'' or \u09b2\u0995\u09cd\u09b7 ''l\u00f4kkh\u00f4''), and the ten million or hundred lakh or [[crore]] (\u0995\u09cb\u099f\u09bf ''koti'') units. In other words, leftwards from the decimal separator, the first grouping consists of three digits, and the subsequent groupings always consist of two digits.\n\nFor example, the English number 17,557,345 will be written in traditional Bengali as \u09e7,\u09ed\u09eb,\u09eb\u09ed,\u09e9\u09ea\u09eb.\n\n===Punctuation marks===\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke \u09a6\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf ''dari'' (\u0964), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar: commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, etc. are the same as in English. Capital letters are absent in the Bengali script so proper names are unmarked.\n\nAn apostrophe, known in Bengali as \u098a\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u0995\u09ae\u09be ''urdhb\u00f4k\u00f4ma'' \"upper comma\", is sometimes used to distinguish between [[homograph]]s, as in \u09aa\u09be\u099f\u09be ''pata'' \"plank\" and \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be ''pa'ta'' \"the leg\". Sometimes, a hyphen is used for the same purpose (as in \u09aa\u09be-\u099f\u09be, an alternative of \u09aa\u09be\u02bc\u099f\u09be).\n\n===Characteristics of the Bengali text===\n[[File:Tagore handwriting Bengali.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An example of handwritten Bengali script. Part of a poem written by Nobel Laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] in 1926 in Hungary.]]\n\nBengali text is written and read horizontally, from left to right. The consonant graphemes and the full form of vowel graphemes fit into an imaginary rectangle of uniform size (uniform width and height). The size of a consonant conjunct, regardless of its complexity, is deliberately maintained the same as that of a single consonant grapheme, so that diacritic vowel forms can be attached to it without any distortion. In a typical Bengali text, orthographic words, words as they are written, can be seen as being separated from each other by an even spacing. Graphemes within a word are also evenly spaced, but that spacing is much narrower than the spacing between words.\n\nUnlike in western scripts ([[Latin script|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], etc.) for which the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter \u09a4 ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral \u09e9 \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster \u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel \u098f ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\n{| class = wikitable style=\"float:right; margin:0.5em; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Grapheme !!

While efforts at standardising the alphabet for the Bengali language continue in such notable centres as the [[Bangla Academy]] at [[Dhaka]] (Bangladesh) and the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi|P\u00f4shchimb\u00f4ngg\u00f4 Bangla Akademi]] at [[Kolkata]] ([[West Bengal]], India), it is still not quite uniform, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters, resulting in concurrent forms for the same sounds. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Assamese and Bengali variations exist today in the formalised system.\n\nIt seems likely that [[standardisation]] of the alphabet will be greatly influenced by the need to typeset it on computers. The large alphabet can be represented, with a great deal of ingenuity, within the [[ASCII]] character set, omitting certain irregular conjuncts. Work has been underway since around 2001 to develop [[Unicode]] [[fonts]], and it seems likely that it will split into two variants, traditional and modern. In this and other articles on Wikipedia dealing with the Bengali language, a [[Romanization of Bengali|Romanization]] scheme used by linguists specialising in [[Bengali phonology]] is included along with [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription. A recent effort by the [[Government of West Bengal]] focused on simplifying the Bengali orthography in primary school texts.\n\nThere is still no uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for the problem.\n\n==Romanization==\n{{Main|Romanization of Bengali}}\n\nRomanization of Bengali is the representation of the [[Bengali language]] in the [[Latin script]]. There are various ways of Romanization systems of Bengali, created in recent years but failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound.

The ''Bibliotheca'' is the only source which gives an account of Atalanta's birth and upbringing. Prince [[Iasus]] wanted a son; when Atalanta was born, he left her on a mountaintop to die. Some stories say that a she-[[Bears in antiquity|bear]] suckled and cared for Atalanta until hunters found and raised her, and she learned to fight and hunt as a bear would. She was later reunited with her father.\n\nHaving grown up in the wilderness, Atalanta became a fierce hunter and was always happy. She took an oath of [[virginity]] to the goddess [[Artemis]], and slew two centaurs, [[Hylaeus and Rhoecus]], who attempted to rape her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Atalanta.html|title=ATALANTA (Atalante) - Arcadian Heroine of Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930094907/http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Atalanta.html|archivedate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thanasis.com/store/atalanta.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823054804/http://www.thanasis.com/store/atalanta.htm |archivedate=2012-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n==Calydonian Boar Hunt==\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens (and workshop) Meleager and Atalante.jpg|thumb|left|278x278px|Meleager, assisted by [[Cupid]], presents Atalanta with the head of the Calydonian Boar.

Atalanta joined [[Meleager]] and many other famous heroes on a hunt for the boar. Many of the men were angry that a woman was joining them, but Meleager, though married, lusted for Atalanta, and so he persuaded them to include her. Several of the men were killed before Atalanta became the first to hit the boar and draw blood. After Meleager finally killed the boar with his spear, he awarded the hide to Atalanta. This act of Meleager\u2019s generosity caused a set of events that led to his death.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOgWfjNIxoMC&lpg=PP1&ots=Njj29ss-a-&dq=Encyclopedia%20of%20Greek%20and%20roman%20mythology%20cite&lr&hl=uk&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=Encyclopedia%20of%20Greek%20and%20roman%20mythology%20cite&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology|last=Roman|first=Luke|last2=Roman|first2=Monica|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=|isbn=9781438126395|location=|pages=88|language=en}}</ref> Meleager's uncles, Plexippus and Toxeus, were angry and tried to take the skin from her. In revenge, Meleager killed his uncles. Wild with grief, Meleager's mother [[Althaea (mythology)|Althaea]] threw a charmed log on the fire, which consumed Meleager's life as it burned.\n\n== Footrace ==\n[[File:Hip\u00f3menes y Atalanta (Reni).jpg|thumb|350px|Guido Reni \u2013 ''[[Atalanta and Hippomenes]]'' \u2013 WGA19271]]\nAfter the Calydonian boar hunt, Atalanta was rediscovered by her father. He wanted her to be married, but Atalanta, uninterested in marriage, agreed to marry only if her suitors could outrun her in a [[footrace]]. Those who lost would be killed. King Oeneus agreed, and many young men died in the attempt until [[Hippomenes]], a grandson of [[Poseidon]], came along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hippomenes asked the goddess [[Aphrodite]] for help, and she gave him three golden apples in order to slow Atalanta down. The apples were irresistible, so every time Atalanta got ahead of Hippomenes, he rolled an apple ahead of her, and she would run after it. In this way, Hippomenes won the footrace and came to marry Atalanta. In some versions, Atalanta loved Hippomenes and hoped he would win.<ref name=\":0\" /> Eventually they had a son [[Parthenopeus|Parthenopaios]], who was one of the [[Seven against Thebes]]. [[Zeus]] \u2013 or his mother, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] \u2013 turned Atalanta and Hippomenes into lions after they had sex together in one of his temples. Other accounts say that Aphrodite changed them into lions because they did not give her proper honor. The belief at the time was that lions could not mate with their own species, only with leopards; thus Atalanta and Hippomenes would never be able to remain with one another.\n\n== The ''Argo'' ==\n\nIn many versions of the quest for the [[Golden Fleece]], such as that published by [[Robert Graves]] in 1944, Atalanta sailed with the [[Argonauts]] as the only woman among them. She jumped aboard the ship soon after the expedition set out, invoking the protection of Artemis, to whom she was a virgin priestess. She was following Meleager, who had put away his young wife for Atalanta's sake. Atalanta returned his love but was prevented by an oracle from consummating their union, being warned that losing her virginity would prove disastrous for her. A disappointed Meleager joined the ''Argo'', but Atalanta would not let him out of her sight. She plays a major part in various adventures of Jason's crew, suffered injury in a battle at [[Colchis]], and was healed by [[Medea]]. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], on the other hand, claims [[Jason]] would not allow a woman on the ship because she would cause strife on the otherwise all-male expedition (Argonautica 1.769\u201373).\n\n==Wrestling==\n\n[[File:Atalanta Peleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 596.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Peleus]] and Atalanta wrestling, black-figured [[hydria]], c. 550 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] (Inv. 596).]]\nThe ''Bibliotheca'' also says she wrestled and defeated [[Peleus]] at the funeral games for [[Pelias]].

The ''Bibliotheca'' is the only source which gives an account of Atalanta's birth and upbringing. Prince [[Iasus]] wanted a son; when Atalanta was born, he left her on a mountaintop to die. Some stories say that a she-[[Bears in antiquity|bear]] suckled and cared for Atalanta until hunters found and raised her, and she learned to fight and hunt as a bear would. She was later reunited with her father.\n\nHaving grown up in the wilderness, Atalanta became a fierce hunter and was always happy. She took an oath of [[virginity]] to the goddess [[Artemis]], and slew two centaurs, [[Hylaeus and Rhoecus]], who attempted to rape her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Atalanta.html|title=ATALANTA (Atalante) - Arcadian Heroine of Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930094907/http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Atalanta.html|archivedate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thanasis.com/store/atalanta.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823054804/http://www.thanasis.com/store/atalanta.htm |archivedate=2012-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n==Calydonian Boar Hunt==\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens (and workshop) Meleager and Atalante.jpg|thumb|left|278x278px|Meleager, assisted by [[Cupid]], presents Atalanta with the head of the Calydonian Boar.

Atalanta joined [[Meleager]] and many other famous heroes on a hunt for the boar. Many of the men were angry that a woman was joining them, but Meleager, though married, lusted for Atalanta, and so he persuaded them to include her. Several of the men were killed before Atalanta became the first to hit the boar and draw blood. After Meleager finally killed the boar with his spear, he awarded the hide to Atalanta. This act of Meleager\u2019s generosity caused a set of events that led to his death.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOgWfjNIxoMC&lpg=PP1&ots=Njj29ss-a-&dq=Encyclopedia%20of%20Greek%20and%20roman%20mythology%20cite&lr&hl=uk&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=Encyclopedia%20of%20Greek%20and%20roman%20mythology%20cite&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology|last=Roman|first=Luke|last2=Roman|first2=Monica|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=|isbn=9781438126395|location=|pages=88|language=en}}</ref> Meleager's uncles, Plexippus and Toxeus, were angry and tried to take the skin from her. In revenge, Meleager killed his uncles. Wild with grief, Meleager's mother [[Althaea (mythology)|Althaea]] threw a charmed log on the fire, which consumed Meleager's life as it burned.\n\n== Footrace ==\n[[File:Hip\u00f3menes y Atalanta (Reni).jpg|thumb|350px|Guido Reni \u2013 ''[[Atalanta and Hippomenes]]'' \u2013 WGA19271]]\nAfter the Calydonian boar hunt, Atalanta was rediscovered by her father. He wanted her to be married, but Atalanta, uninterested in marriage, agreed to marry only if her suitors could outrun her in a [[footrace]]. Those who lost would be killed. King Oeneus agreed, and many young men died in the attempt until [[Hippomenes]], a grandson of [[Poseidon]], came along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hippomenes asked the goddess [[Aphrodite]] for help, and she gave him three golden apples in order to slow Atalanta down. The apples were irresistible, so every time Atalanta got ahead of Hippomenes, he rolled an apple ahead of her, and she would run after it. In this way, Hippomenes won the footrace and came to marry Atalanta. In some versions, Atalanta loved Hippomenes and hoped he would win.<ref name=\":0\" /> Eventually they had a son [[Parthenopeus|Parthenopaios]], who was one of the [[Seven against Thebes]]. [[Zeus]] \u2013 or his mother, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] \u2013 turned Atalanta and Hippomenes into lions after they had sex together in one of his temples. Other accounts say that Aphrodite changed them into lions because they did not give her proper honor. The belief at the time was that lions could not mate with their own species, only with leopards; thus Atalanta and Hippomenes would never be able to remain with one another.\n\n== The ''Argo'' ==\n\nIn many versions of the quest for the [[Golden Fleece]], such as that published by [[Robert Graves]] in 1944, Atalanta sailed with the [[Argonauts]] as the only woman among them. She jumped aboard the ship soon after the expedition set out, invoking the protection of Artemis, to whom she was a virgin priestess. She was following Meleager, who had put away his young wife for Atalanta's sake. Atalanta returned his love but was prevented by an oracle from consummating their union, being warned that losing her virginity would prove disastrous for her. A disappointed Meleager joined the ''Argo'', but Atalanta would not let him out of her sight. She plays a major part in various adventures of Jason's crew, suffered injury in a battle at [[Colchis]], and was healed by [[Medea]]. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], on the other hand, claims [[Jason]] would not allow a woman on the ship because she would cause strife on the otherwise all-male expedition (Argonautica 1.769\u201373).\n\n==Wrestling==\n\n[[File:Atalanta Peleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 596.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Peleus]] and Atalanta wrestling, black-figured [[hydria]], c. 550 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] (Inv. 596).]]\nThe ''Bibliotheca'' also says she wrestled and defeated [[Peleus]] at the funeral games for [[Pelias]].
