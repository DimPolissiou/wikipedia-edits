He attended [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry Officer Training]] and was then selected to attend the U.S. Army's [[Ranger School]]. Behenna was assigned to the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]] as the platoon leader for 5th Platoon, Delta Company of the 1st Battalion, [[327th Infantry Regiment]] and deployed to [[Iraq]] in 2007.<ref name=starsandstripes>{{cite web |title=Hearing on Iraq detainee death case postponed |author=Joseph Giordono |publisher=Stars and Stripes |url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=56836}}</ref>\n\nDuring his tour of duty in Iraq, Behenna's platoon conducted counterinsurgency operations in the [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salahuddin]] province with a focus on the towns of Mezra, [[Hajaj]] and Butoma. Behenna made efforts to develop ties with local Iraqis as part of his counter-insurgency mission and, already fluent in Spanish, began to teach himself Arabic. He was known to host cookouts with his platoon for local interpreters, engage with civilians on the street and encouraged his soldiers to learn about Iraqi culture and to eat their food. This desire to interact with locals caused some friction within his platoon, with one soldier commenting: \n<blockquote>\nHe would talk to random civilians, anyone. He was the type of guy that liked Iraqis. That was the only annoying thing about him. He was always about saving the country.<ref name=latimes1/>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn April 21, 2008, Behenna's platoon was returning to their base with two detainees when their convoy was hit by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]. One of the platoon's [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAPs]] was destroyed and two soldiers, [[Specialist (rank)|Specialists]] Adam Kohlhaas and Steven Christofferson, were killed and several others grievously wounded. The loss of his men weighed heavily on Behenna who at one point broke down in tears over the incident during a group therapy session.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nOn May 5, Behenna received information on a man suspected by military intelligence to be working for [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], which they believed was responsible for the April 21 attack. Acting on this intelligence, Behenna's platoon raided a house in Butoma where they found the man identified by military intelligence, Ali Mansur Mohamed, along with a cache of ammunition, an [[RPK]] light machine gun and a passport with Syrian visas. After securing Mansur and collecting the arms cache, Behenna's platoon returned to base with Mansur and turned him over to military intelligence agents for questioning.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nLess than two weeks later, Mansur was ordered released due to military intelligence having insufficient evidence to hold him any longer. Behenna's platoon was tasked with the return of Mansur to town as soon as possible. On May 16, while returning the prisoner to a checkpoint as ordered, Behenna and his platoon stopped at a bridge in the northern oil refinery town of [[Baiji, Iraq|Baiji]] and, with the help of his Iraqi interpreter, nicknamed \"Harry\",<ref name=latimes2/> tried to question Mansur on the April 21 attacks. According to the interpreter:\n{{quote|\nLieutenant Behenna started talking with Ali Mansur and Sergeant Warner followed them.<br>\nBehenna and Warner started taking off Ali Mansur's clothes with their knives.<br>\nThey then cut his handcuffs.<br>\nAli Mansur said I will talk to you<br>\nbut Lieutenant Behenna pulled trigger and killed him<br>\nBefore we started the patrol,<br>\nLieutenant Behenna told to Ali Mansur 'I will kill you'.<br>\nI thought Lieutenant Behenna was trying to scare him.<br>\nI did not think he would go through<br>\nI was standing 10 metres back during the shooting<br>\nI could see everything even if it was getting dark<br>\nand Sergeant Warner was next to me.<br>\nHe took the grenade from his pocket, pulled the safety ring, walked around<br>\nand put the grenade under Ali Mansur's head.<br>\nThen they hid his clothes, and Behenna and Warner went back.<br>\n|Harry}}\n\nTwo U.S. soldiers from the same battalion as the accused also testified against Warner. Corporal Cody Atkinson said that Behenna and Warner, armed with a grenade, took Mansur out of the vehicle and under the bridge, and that \"Warner told us to write that Ali Mansur had been released\".

In November 2008, Behenna was returned to [[Fort Campbell]] and assigned to security duties pending a court-martial.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\n==Court-martial==\nAfter Behenna's [[Article 32 hearing]], his family hired defense attorney Jack Zimmerman, a former United States Marine, military trial judge and Vietnam veteran. The prosecution, led by Captain Erwin Roberts, made its opening statements on February 23, 2009. The prosecution's two principal witnesses were Iraqi interpreter \"Harry\" and Staff Sergeant Warner.

Zimmerman confronted the prosecution about any potential information they might possess about Behenna, but the prosecution denied being aware of any.\n\nUpon post-trial evidence of these series of events, a former senator, several former [[United States Attorneys|U.S. Attorneys]] and States Attorneys General, law professors, and lawyers wrote to the [[Secretary of the United States Army]], [[Pete Geren]], asking for a retrial.<ref>http://defendmichael.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/1605688431_lawyers_letter.pdf</ref>\n\nAfter learning that the prosecution had not passed on his information, Dr. MacDonnell also signed several motions for mistrial.

On July 31, 2008, Behenna was relieved of his command and charged with the premeditated murder of Ali Mansur Mohamed. In November 2008, Behenna was returned to [[Fort Campbell]] and assigned to security duties pending a court-martial.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\n==Court-martial==\nAfter Behenna's [[Article 32 hearing]], his family hired defense attorney Jack Zimmerman, a former United States Marine, military trial judge and Vietnam veteran. The prosecution, led by Captain Erwin Roberts, made its opening statements on February 23, 2009. The prosecution's two principal witnesses were Iraqi interpreter \"Harry\" and Staff Sergeant Warner. Warner struck a [[plea bargain]] with the prosecution where he agreed to plead guilty to assault, maltreatment of a subordinate and making a false statement in exchange for not being charged with premeditated murder and for his future testimony against Behenna.<ref name=abcplea>{{cite web |title=Soldier Pleads Guilty to Assault in Iraq Death |author=Brett Barrouquere |publisher=ABC News |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=6905323}}</ref> The defense contended that Behenna was under an acute stress disorder as a result of the attacks on his platoon and that during the shooting he had acted in self-defense after Mansur lunged at him.<ref>{{cite news |title=US soldier guilty of Iraq murder |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7916209.stm | date=February 28, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> After less than three and a half hours of deliberation, the jury came back finding Behenna not guilty of making a false declaration and premeditated murder, but guilty of [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|UCMJ]] Article 118, unpremeditated murder and sentenced to 25 years confinement.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\n===Appeals and release===\n\n[[File:Pardon of Michael Behenna.pdf|thumb|Pardon of Michael Behenna]]\nBehenna's appeal, arguing that the government failed to disclose [[Brady material]] in the form of the prosecution's forensic analyst Herbert MacDonell's statements to the defense that his analysis of the wounds corroborated Behenna's accounting of the shooting as being self-defense, was rejected in a 3\u20132 decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] on July 5, 2012.<ref name=latimes2/> The defense contended that Dr. MacDonnell had told the prosecution that Behenna's story was consistent with the forensic evidence and that they needed to alert the defense of that fact under the ruling of the Supreme Court in ''[[Brady v.

Zimmerman confronted the prosecution about any potential information they might possess about Behenna, but the prosecution denied being aware of any.\n\nUpon post-trial evidence of these series of events, a former senator, several former [[United States Attorneys|U.S. Attorneys]] and States Attorneys General, law professors, and lawyers wrote to the [[Secretary of the United States Army]], [[Pete Geren]], asking for a retrial.<ref>http://defendmichael.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/1605688431_lawyers_letter.pdf</ref>\n\nAfter learning that the prosecution had not passed on his information, Dr. MacDonnell also signed several motions for mistrial.

HCL Notes (and since HCL Domino 9, the Notes Browser Plugin) may be used to access any HCL Domino application, such as discussion forums, document libraries, and numerous other applications. IBM Notes resembles a web-browser in that it may run any compatible application that the user has permission for.\n\nHCL Notes  provides applications that can be used to:\n* access, store and present information through a user interface\n* enforce security\n* replicate, that is, allow many different servers to contain the same information and have many users work with that data\n\nThe standard storage mechanism in HCL Domino is a [[NoSQL]] [[document database|document-database]] format, the \"Notes Storage Facility\" (.nsf). The .nsf file will normally contain both an application design and its associated data. IBM Notes can also access [[relational database]]s, either through an additional server called HCL Enterprise Integrator for Domino, through ODBC calls or through the use of XPages.\n\nAs HCL Notes and Domino is an [[application runtime environment]], email and calendars operate as applications within HCL Notes, which HCL provides with the product.

In December, 2019, HCL released HCL Domino v11 and HCL Notes v11. \n\n==Overview==\n\n===Client/server===\nHCL Notes and Domino is a [[NoSQL]] client/server database environment. The server software is called HCL Domino and the client software is HCL Notes. HCL Domino software can run on Windows, Unix, Linux, [[AIX]], and HCL mid-range systems and can scale to tens of thousands of users per server. There are different supported versions of the HCL Domino server that are supported on the various levels of server operating systems. Usually the latest server operating system is only officially supported by a version of HCL Domino that is released at about the same time as that OS.\n\nHCL Domino has security capabilities on a variety of levels. The authorizations can be granular, down to the field level in specific records all the way up to 10 different parameters that can be set up at a database level, with intermediate options in between. Users can also assign access for other users to their personal calendar and email on a more generic reader, editor, edit with delete and manage my calendar levels. All of the security in HCL Notes and Domino is independent of the server OS or Active Directory. Optionally, the HCL Notes client can be configured to have the user use their Active Directory identity.\n\n===Data replication===\nThe first release of IBM Notes included a generalized replication facility. The generalized nature of this feature set it apart from predecessors like [[Usenet]] and continued to differentiate IBM Notes.\n\nIBM Domino servers and Notes clients identify NSF files by their Replica IDs, and keep replicate files synchronized by bi-directionally exchanging data, metadata, and application logic and design. There are options available to define what meta-data replicate, or specifically exclude certain meta data from replicating. Replication between two servers, or between a client and a server, can occur over a network or a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] modem connection. Replication between servers may occur at intervals according to a defined schedule, in near-[[Real-time operating system|real-time]] when triggered by data changes in server clusters, or when triggered by an administrator or program.\n\nCreation of a local replica of an NSF file on the hard disk of an IBM Notes client enables the user to fully use IBM Notes and Domino databases while working off-line. The client synchronizes any changes when client and server next connect. Local replicas are also sometimes maintained for use while connected to the network in order to reduce network [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. Replication between an IBM Notes client and Domino server can run automatically according to a schedule, or manually in response to a user or programmatic request. Since Notes 6, local replicas maintain all security features programmed into the applications. Earlier releases of Notes did not always do so. Early releases also did not offer a way to [[encryption|encrypt]] NSF files, raising concerns that local replicas might expose too much confidential data on [[laptop]]s or insecure [[home office]] computers, but more recent releases offer encryption, and as of {{when|date=July 2015}} the default setting for newly created local replicas.\n\n===Security===\nIBM Notes was the first widely adopted software product to use [[public key cryptography]] for client\u2013server and server\u2013server authentication and for encryption of data. Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000, IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits. In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a \"workload reduction factor\" for the NSA. This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private-sector [[industrial espionage]], but not against spying by the US government.<ref>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/19.52.html#subj1 \"The Swedes discover Lotus Notes has key escrow!\"] ''The Risks Digest'', Volume 19, Issue 52, 1997-12-24</ref><ref>[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/2/2898/1.html Only NSA can listen, so that's OK] Heise, 1999.</ref> This implementation was widely announced, but with some justification many people did consider it to be a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]. Some governments objected to being put at a disadvantage to the NSA, and as a result Lotus continued to support the 40-bit version for export to those countries.\n\nUnder current US export laws, IBM Notes supports only one version of the Notes PKI with 128-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit public keys, and no workload reduction factor. The Domino server includes security tools support [[S/MIME]], [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] 3.0 with industry standard key sizes for HTTP and other [[Internet Protocol|Internet protocols]], [[X.509]] client certificates, and an integrated [[certificate authority]].\n\nIBM Notes and Domino also uses a code-signature framework that controls the security context, runtime, and rights of custom code developed and introduced into the environment. Notes 5 introduced an execution control list (ECL) at the client level. The ECL allows or denies the execution of custom code based on the signature attached to it, preventing code from untrusted (and possibly malignant) sources from running. Notes and Domino 6 allowed client ECLs to be managed centrally by server administrators through the implementation of policies. Since release 4.5, the code signatures listed in properly configured ECLs prevent code from being executed by external sources, to avoid [[computer virus|virus]] propagation through Notes/Domino environments. Administrators can centrally control whether each mailbox user can add exceptions to, and thus override, the ECL.\n\n===Database security===\nAccess control lists (ACLs) control a user of server's level of access to that database. Only a user with Manager access can create or modify the ACL. Default entries in the ACL can be set when the Manager creates the database.\n\nRoles, rather than user id, can determine access level.\n\n===Programming===\nIBM Notes and Domino is a cross-platform, distributed document-oriented [[NoSQL]] database and messaging framework and rapid application development environment that includes pre-built applications like email, calendar, etc. This sets it apart from its major commercial competitors, such as [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] or [[Novell GroupWise]], which are purpose-built applications for mail and calendaring that offer APIs for extensibility.\n\nIBM Domino databases are built using the IBM Domino Designer client, available only for [[Microsoft Windows]]; standard user clients are available for Windows, [[Linux]], and [[macOS]].<ref>Domino Designer clients available here http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ls/lsndad/</ref> A key feature of IBM Notes is that many replicas of the same database can exist at the same time on different servers and clients, across dissimilar platforms; the same storage architecture is used for both client and server replicas. Originally, replication in Notes happened at document (i.e., record) level. With release of Notes 4 in 1996, replication was changed so that it now occurs at field level.\n\nA database is a Notes Storage Facility (.nsf) file, containing basic units of storage known as a \"note\". Every note has a UniqueID that is shared by all its replicas. Every replica also has a UniqueID that uniquely identifies it within any cluster of servers, a domain of servers, or even across domains belonging to many organizations that are all hosting replicas of the same database. Each note also stores its creation and modification dates, and one or more Items.\n\nThere are several classes of notes, including design notes and document notes. Design notes are created and modified with the Domino Designer client, and represent programmable elements, such as the GUI layout of forms for displaying and editing data, or formulas and scripts for manipulating data. Document notes represent user data, and are created and modified with the Lotus Notes client, via a web browser, via mail routing and delivery, or via programmed code.\n\nDocument notes can have parent-child relationships, but IBM Notes should not be considered a hierarchical database in the classic sense of [[information management system]]s. Notes databases are also not [[Relational model|relational]], although there is a [[SQL]] driver that can be used with Notes, and it does have some features that can be used to develop applications that mimic relational features. IBM Notes does not support atomic transactions, and its [[file locking]] is rudimentary. IBM Notes is a [[document-oriented database]] (document-based, schema-less, loosely structured) with support for rich content and powerful indexing facilities. This structure closely mimics paper-based work flows that IBM Notes is typically used to automate.\n\nItems represent the content of a note. Every item has a name, a type, and may have some flags set. A note can have more than one item with the same name. Item types include Number, Number List, Text, Text List, Date-Time, Date-Time List, and Rich Text. Flags are used for managing attributes associated with the item, such as read or write security. Items in design notes represent the programmed elements of a database. For example, the layout of an entry form is stored in the rich text Body item within a form design note. This means that the design of the database can replicate to users' desktops just like the data itself, making it extremely easy to deploy updated applications.\n\nItems in document notes represent user-entered or computed data. An item named \"Form\" in a document note can be used to bind a document to a form design note, which directs the IBM Notes client to merge the content of the document note items with the GUI information and code represented in the given form design note for display and editing purposes. However, other methods can be used to override this binding of a document to a form note. The resulting loose binding of documents to design information is one of the cornerstones of the power of IBM Notes. Traditional database developers used to working with rigidly enforced schemas, on the other hand, may consider the power of this feature to be a double-edged sword.\n\nIBM Notes applications development uses several programming languages. [[Formula language|Formula]] and LotusScript are the two original ones. LotusScript is similar to, and may even be considered a specialized implementation of, Visual Basic, but with the addition of many native classes that model the IBM Notes environment, whereas Formula is similar to [[Lotus 1-2-3]] formula language but is unique to Notes.\n\nJava was integrated into IBM Notes beginning with Release 4.5. With Release 5, Java support was greatly enhanced and expanded, and [[JavaScript]] was added. While LotusScript remains a primary tool in developing applications for the Lotus Notes client, Java and JavaScript are the primary tools for server-based processing, developing applications for browser access, and allowing browsers to emulate the functionality of the IBM Notes client. With XPages, the IBM Notes client can now natively process Java and JavaScript code, although applications development usually requires at least some code specific to only IBM Notes or only a browser.\n\nAs of version 6, Lotus established an [[XML]] programming interface in addition to the options already available. The Domino XML Language (DXL) provides XML representations of all data and design resources in the Notes model, allowing any XML processing tool to create and modify IBM Notes and Domino data.\n\nSince Release 8.5, XPages were also integrated into IBM Notes.\n\nExternal to the IBM Notes application, IBM provides toolkits in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] to connect to the IBM Domino database and perform a wide variety of tasks. The C toolkit is the most mature, and the C++ toolkit is an objectized version of the C toolkit, lacking many functions the C toolkit provides. The Java toolkit is the least mature of the three and can be used for basic application needs.\n\n===Database===\nIBM Notes includes a [[database management system]] but IBM Notes files are different from relational or object databases because they are document-centric. [[Document-oriented database]]s such as IBM Notes allow multiple values in items (fields), do not require a [[database schema|schema]], come with built-in document-level access control, and store rich text data. IBM Domino 7 to 8.5.x supports the use of [[IBM DB2]] database as an alternative store for IBM Notes databases. This NSFDB2 feature, however, is now in maintenance mode with no further development planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21384421|title=IBM Support statement for Lotus Domino NSFDB2 - United States\n|date=January 10, 2017 |website=www-01.ibm.com |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref> An IBM Notes database can be mapped to a relational database using tools like DECS, [LEI], JDBCSql for Domino or NotesSQL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |title=NotesSQL |publisher=IBM |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602090000/http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |archive-date=June 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIt could be argued that IBM Notes and Domino is a multi-value database system like [[Pick operating system|PICK]], or that it is an object system like [[Zope]], but it is in fact unique. Whereas the temptation for relational database programmers is to [[database normalization|normalize]] databases, Notes databases must be [[denormalization|denormalized]]. RDBMS developers often find it difficult to conceptualize the difference. It may be useful to think of an IBM Notes document (a 'note') as analogous to an XML document natively stored in a database (although with limitations on the data types and structures available).\n\nSince Lotus Notes 8.5, IBM started to change the term Database to Application, because of the reason that these files are not really object databases as mentioned above.\n\nThe benefits of this data structure are:\n# No need to define size of fields, or datatype;\n# Attributes (Notes fields) that are null take up no space in a database;\n# Built-in full text searching.\n\n===Configuration===\nThe IBM Domino server or the IBM Notes client store their configuration in their own databases / application files (*.nsf). No relevant configuration settings are saved in the Windows Registry if the operating system is Windows. Some other configuration options (primary the start configuration) is stored in the notes.ini (there are currently over 2000 known options available<ref>notes.ini Reference - by alphabet http://www.lntoolbox.com/en/notesini-reference.html</ref>).\n\n==Use as an email client==\nIBM Notes is commonly deployed as an end-user email client in larger organizations, with IBM claiming a cumulative 145 million {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} licenses sold to date.\n\nWhen an organization employs an IBM Domino server, it usually also deploys the supplied IBM Notes client for accessing the IBM Notes application for email and calendaring but also to use document management and workflow applications. As IBM Notes is a runtime environment, and the email and calendaring functions in IBM Notes are simply an application provided by IBM, the administrators are free to develop alternate email and calendaring applications. It is also possible to alter, amend or extend the IBM supplied email and calendaring application.\n\nThe IBM Domino server also supports [[POP3]] and [[IMAP]] mail clients, and through an extension product (IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook) supports native access for Microsoft Outlook clients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=877&letternum=ENUSZP16-0324 |title=IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook, V2.0 expands mail client options for IBM Notes and IBM Domino |publisher=IBM \n|date=June 28, 2016  |accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIBM also provides IBM iNotes (in Notes 6.5 renamed to \"Domino Web Access\" but in version 8.0 reverted to iNotes), to allow the use of email and calendaring features through web browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux, such as [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Firefox]]. There are several spam filtering programs available (including IBM Lotus Protector), and a rules engine allowing user-defined mail processing to be performed by the server.\n\n===Comparison with other email clients===\nIBM Notes was designed as a collaborative application platform where email was just one of numerous applications that ran in the Notes client software. The Notes client was also designed to run on multiple platforms including [[Windows]], [[OS/2]], [[classic Mac OS]], SCO Open Desktop UNIX, and Linux. These two factors have resulted in the user interface containing some differences from applications that only run on Windows. Furthermore, these differences have often remained in the product to retain backward compatibility with earlier releases, instead of conforming to updated Windows UI standards. The following are some of these differences.\n* Properties dialog boxes for formatting text, hyperlinks and other rich-text information can remain open after a user makes changes to selected text. This provides flexibility to select new text and apply other formatting without closing the dialog box, selecting new text and opening a new format dialog box. Almost all other Windows applications require the user to close the dialog box, select new text, then open a new dialog box for formatting/changes.\n* Properties dialog boxes also automatically recognize the type of text selected and display appropriate selections (for instance, a hyperlink properties box).\n* Users can format tables as tabbed interfaces as part of form design (for applications) or within mail messages (or in rich-text fields in applications). This provides users the ability to provide tab-style organization to documents, similar to popular tab navigation in most web portals, etc.\n* End-users can readily insert links to IBM Notes applications, IBM Notes views or other IBM Notes documents into IBM Notes documents.\n* Deleting a document (or email) will delete it from every folder in which it appears, since the folders simply contain links to the same back-end document. Some other email clients only delete the email from the current folder; if the email appears in other folders it is left alone, requiring the user to hunt through multiple folders in order to completely delete a message. In IBM Notes, clicking on \"Remove from Folder\" will remove the document only from that folder leaving all other instances intact.\n* The ''All Documents'' and ''Sent'' \"views\" differ from other collections of documents known as \"folders\" and exhibit different behaviors. Specifically, mail cannot be dragged out of them, and so removed from those views; the email can only be \"copied\" from them. This is because these are ''views'', and their membership indexes are maintained according to characteristics of the documents contained in them, rather than based on user interaction as is the case for a ''folder''. This technical difference can be baffling to users, in environments where no training is given. ''All Documents'' contain all of the documents in a mailbox, no matter which folder it is in. The only way to remove something from ''All Documents'' is to delete it outright.\n\nLotus Notes 7 and older versions had more differences, which were removed from subsequent releases:\n* Users select a \"New Memo\" to send an email, rather than \"New Mail\" or \"New Message\". (Notes 8 calls the command \"New Message\")\n* To select multiple documents in a Notes view, one drags one's mouse next to the documents to select, rather than using {{keypress|\u21e7 Shift}}+single click. (Notes 8 uses keypress conventions.)\n* The searching function offers a \"phrase search\", rather than the more common \"or search\", and Notes requires users to spell out boolean conditions in search-strings. As a result, users must search for \"delete AND folder\" in order to find help text that contains the phrase \"delete a folder\". Searching for \"delete folder\" does not yield the desired result. (Notes 8 uses or-search conventions.)\n\nLotus Notes 8.0 (released in 2007) became the first version to employ a dedicated user-experience team,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/marybeth/entry/welcome_to_my_design_blog |title=Welcome to my \"design blog\"! |author=Mary Raven |publisher=IBM |date=April 18, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref> resulting in changes in the IBM Notes client experience in the primary and new notes user interface. This new interface runs in the open source [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Framework, which is a project started by IBM, opening up more application development opportunities through the use of Eclipse plug-ins. The new interface provides many new user interface features and the ability to include user-selected applications/applets in small panes in the interface. Lotus Notes 8.0 also included a new email interface / design to match the new Lotus Notes 8.0 eclipse based interface. Eclipse is a Java framework and allows IBM to port Notes to other platforms rapidly. An issue with Eclipse and therefore Notes 8.0 is the applications start-up and user-interaction speed. Lotus Notes 8.5 sped up the application and the increase in general specification of PCs means this is less of an issue.\n\nIBM Notes 9 continued the evolution of the user interface to more closely align with modern application interfaces found in many commercial packaged or web-based software. Currently, the software still does not have an auto-correct option - or even ability - to reverse accidental use of caps lock.\n\nDomino is now running on the Eclipse platform and offers many new development environments and tools such as XPages.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.lifeit.co.uk/infrastructure/domino/training/\n| title = Lotus Notes & Domino Training - Life IT\n| website = www.lifeit.co.uk\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref>\n\nFor lower spec PCs, a new version of the old interface is still provided albeit as it is the old interface many of the new features are not available and the email user interface reverts to the Notes 7.x style.\n\nThis new user experience builds on Notes 6.5 (released in 2003), which upgraded the email client, previously regarded by many as the product's [[Achilles heel]]. Features added at that time included:\n* drag and drop of folders\n* replication of unread marks between servers\n* follow-up flags\n* reply and forward indicators on emails\n* ability to edit an attachment and save the changes back to an email id\n\n==Reception==\n{{Criticism section|date=June 2014}}\n\nPublications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006 have criticized earlier versions of Lotus Notes for having an \"unintuitive [user] interface\" and cite widespread dissatisfaction with the [[usability]] of the client software. ''The Guardian'' indicated that Notes has not necessarily suffered as a result of this dissatisfaction due to the fact that \"the people who choose [enterprise software] tend not to be the ones who use it.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1705106,00.html\n | title = Survival of the unfittest\n |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 2006-02-09\n| first=Charles\n| last=Arthur\n}}</ref>\n\nEarlier versions of Lotus Notes have also been criticized for violating an important usability best practice that suggests a consistent UI is often better than custom alternative. Software written for a particular [[operating system]] should follow that particular OS's [[user interface]] style guide. Not following those style guides can confuse users. A notable example is F5 keyboard shortcut, which is used to refresh window contents in Microsoft Windows. Pressing F5 in Lotus Notes before release 8.0 caused it to lock screen. Since this was a major point of criticism this was changed in release 8.0. Old versions did not support proportional scrollbars (which give the user an idea of how long the document is, relative to the portion being viewed).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |title       = Lotus Notes Sucks\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120422075347/http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |archive-date = 2012-04-22\n |df          = \n}}</ref> Proportional scroll bars were only introduced in Notes 8.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/updated-lotus-notes-hannover-screenshots#01252006042825PMPSCUCT.htm\n | title = Updated Lotus Notes \"Hannover\" screenshots (comment)\n}}</ref>\n\nOlder versions of Lotus Notes also suffered from similar user interaction choices, many of which were also corrected in subsequent releases. One example that was corrected in Release 8.5: In earlier versions the out-of-office agent needed to be manually enabled when leaving and disabled when coming back, even if start and end date have been set. As of Release 8.5 the out-of-office notification now automatically shuts off without a need for a manual disable.\n\nUnlike some other e-mail client software programs, IBM Notes developers made a choice to not allow individual users to determine whether a return receipt is sent when they open an e-mail; rather, that option is configured at the server level. IBM developers believe \"Allowing individual cancellation of return receipt violates the intent of a return receipt function within an organization\". So, depending on system settings, users will have no choice in return receipts going back to spammers or other senders of unwanted e-mail. This has led tech sites to publish ways to get around this feature of Notes. For IBM Notes 9.0 and IBM iNotes 9.0, the IBM Domino server's .INI file can now contain an entry to control return receipt in a manner that's more aligned with community expectations (IBM Notes 9 Product Documentation).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21241003\n | title = Is there a setting in Lotus Notes to control whether a return receipt is sent?\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/tip/Finding-and-disabling-hidden-return-receipts\n | title = Finding and disabling return receipts\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.mindwatering.net/SupportRef.nsf/b49d69a888845c8085256d220011d77b/37fdcce19aa1551685256929001226d1!OpenDocument\n | title = Techniques to Not Send a Return Receipt When Viewing Mail\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen IBM Notes crashes, some processes may continue running and prevent the application from being restarted until they are killed.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.virtualobjectives.com.au/notesdomino/killnotes.htm| title = KillNotes}}</ref>\n\n==Related software==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Related IBM Lotus products===\nOver the 30-year history of IBM Notes, Lotus Development Corporation and later IBM have developed many other software products that are based on or integrated with IBM Notes. The most prominent of these is the [[IBM Lotus Domino]] server software, which was originally known as the Lotus Notes Server and gained a separate name with the release of version 4.5. The server platform also became the foundation for products such as [[IBM Lotus Quickr|IBM Lotus Quickr for Domino]], for document management, and [[IBM Lotus Sametime|IBM Sametime]] for instant messaging, audio and video communication, and web conferencing, and with Release 8.5, [[IBM Connections]].\n\nIn early releases of IBM Notes, there was considerable emphasis on client-side integration with the [[IBM Lotus SmartSuite]] environment. With Microsoft's increasing predominance in office productivity software, the desktop integration focus switched for a time to [[Microsoft Office]]. With the release of version 8.0 in 2007, based on the Eclipse framework, IBM again added integration with its own office-productivity suite, the [[OpenOffice.org]]-derived [[IBM Lotus Symphony]]. [[IBM Lotus Expeditor]] is a framework for developing Eclipse-based applications.\n\nOther IBM products and technologies have also been built to integrate with IBM Notes. For mobile-device synchronization, this previously included the client-side [[IBM Lotus Easysync Pro]] product (no longer in development) and [[IBM Lotus Notes Traveler|IBM Notes Traveler]], a newer no-charge server-side add-on for mail, calendar and contact sync. A recent addition to IBM's portfolio are two [[IBM Lotus Protector]] products for mail security and encryption, which have been built to integrate with IBM Notes.\n\n===Related software from other vendors===\nWith a long market history and large installed base, IBM Notes and Domino have spawned a large third-party software ecosystem. Such products can be divided into four broad, and somewhat overlapping classes:\n\n* IBM Notes and Domino applications are software programs written in the form of one or more IBM Notes databases, and often supplied as NTF templates. This type of software typically is focused on providing business benefit from IBM Notes' core collaboration, workflow and messaging capabilities. Examples include customer relationship management (CRM), human resources, and project tracking systems. Some applications of this sort may offer a browser interface in addition to Notes client access. The code within these programs typically uses the same languages available to an in-house IBM Domino developer: IBM Notes formula language, [[LotusScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaScript]].\n* IBM Notes and Domino add-ons, tools and extensions are generally executable programs written in C, C++ or another compiled language that are designed specifically to integrate with IBM Notes and Domino. This class of software may include both client- and server-side executable components. In some cases, IBM Notes databases may be used for configuration and reporting. Since the advent of the Eclipse-based Notes 8 Standard client, client-side add-ons may also include Eclipse plug-ins and XML-based widgets. The typical role for this type of software is to support or extend core IBM Notes functionality. Examples include spam and anti-virus products, server administration and monitoring tools, messaging and storage management products, policy-based tools, data synchronization tools and developer tools.\n* IBM Notes and Domino-aware adds-ins and agents are also executable programs, but they are designed to extend the reach of a general networked software product to IBM Notes and IBM Domino data. This class includes server and client backup software, anti-spam and anti-virus products, and e-discovery and archiving systems. It also includes add-ins to integrate IBM Notes with third-party offerings such as Cisco [[WebEx]] conferencing service or the [[Salesforce.com]] CRM platform.\n\n==History==\nIBM Notes has a history spanning more than 30 years.<ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory Official history of Lotus Notes] IBM DeveloperWorks Web Site</ref> Its chief inspiration was ''PLATO Notes'', created by David R. Woolley at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1973. In today's terminology, PLATO Notes was a message board, and it was part of the foundation for an online community which thrived for more than 20 years on the [[PLATO system]].<ref>[https://archives.library.illinois.edu/e-records/index.php?dir=University%20Archives/0713010/ PLATO Notes Files, 1972-1976 (Record Series 7/13/10)], from the [https://archives.library.illinois.edu/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&id=5145 University of Illinois Archives]; this includes several years worth of transcripts of old notes files from the mid 1970s, recovered from very low quality printouts.</ref> [[Ray Ozzie]] worked with PLATO while attending the University of Illinois in the 1970s. When PC network technology began to emerge, Ozzie made a deal with [[Mitch Kapor]], the founder of [[Lotus Development Corporation]], that resulted in the formation of [[Iris Associates]] in 1984 to develop products that would combine the capabilities of PCs with the collaborative tools pioneered in PLATO. The agreement put control of product development under Ozzie and Iris, and sales and marketing under Lotus. In 1994, after the release and marketplace success of Notes R3, Lotus purchased Iris. In 1995 IBM purchased Lotus.\n\nIn 2008, IBM released [[XPages]] technology, based on [[JavaServer Faces]]. This allows IBM Domino applications to be better surfaced to browser clients, though the UX and business logic must be completely rewritten. Previously, IBM Domino applications could be accessed through browsers, but required extensive web specific modifications to get full functionality in browsers. XPages also give the application new capabilities that are not possible with the classic IBM Notes client. The IBM Domino 9 Social Edition included the IBM Notes Browser Plugin, which would surface Notes applications through a minified version of the rich desktop client contained in a browser tab.\n\n===Branding===\nPrior to release 4.5, the ''Lotus Notes'' branding encompassed both the client and server applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory/ |title=The History of Notes and Domino |publisher=IBM \n|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> In 1996, Lotus released an [[HTTP]] server add-on for the Notes 4 server called \"Domino\". This add-on allowed Notes documents to be rendered as web pages in real time. Later that year, the Domino web server was integrated into release 4.5 of the core Notes server and the entire server program was re-branded, taking on the name \"[[IBM Lotus Domino|Domino]]\". Only the client program officially retained the \"Lotus Notes\" name.\n\nIn November 2012, IBM announced it would  be dropping the Lotus brand and moving forward with the IBM brand only to identify products, including Notes and Domino.<ref>[http://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/ibm-drops-lotus-brand-takes-notes-and-domino-forward/ \"IBM Drops Lotus Brand, Takes Notes and Domino Forward\"] Article published in November, 2012</ref> On October 9, 2018, IBM announced the availability of the latest version of the client and server software.\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

IBM Notes resembles a web-browser in that it may run any compatible application that the user has permission for.\n\nHCL Notes  provides applications that can be used to:\n* access, store and present information through a user interface\n* enforce security\n* replicate, that is, allow many different servers to contain the same information and have many users work with that data\n\nThe standard storage mechanism in HCL Domino is a [[NoSQL]] [[document database|document-database]] format, the \"Notes Storage Facility\" (.nsf). The .nsf file will normally contain both an application design and its associated data. IBM Notes can also access [[relational database]]s, either through an additional server called HCL Enterprise Integrator for Domino, through ODBC calls or through the use of XPages.\n\nAs HCL Notes and Domino is an [[application runtime environment]], email and calendars operate as applications within HCL Notes, which HCL provides with the product. A Domino application-developer can change or completely replace that application.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.peoplecube.com/products-rs-lotus-notes-faq.htm/ \n|title=Third party alters and extends the email and calendaring application supplied by IBM for Lotus Notes |publisher=Peoplecube.com |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}\n</ref>  HCL has released the base templates as open source as well.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ddrschiw/ad113 |title=Lotusphere 2010 presentation: AD113 - IBM Lotus Notes Discussion Template: Next Generation and Other OpenNTF Assets |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=June 18, 2009\n |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nProgrammers can develop applications for HCL Notes in a variety of development languages including:\n* the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] either directly or through XPages\n* [[LotusScript]], a language resembling [[Visual Basic]]\n* the [[JavaScript (programming language)|JavaScript programming language]] via the Domino AppDev Pack\n\nThe client supports a formula language as well as JavaScript. Software developers can build applications to run either within the HCL Notes application runtime environment or through a web server for use in a web browser, although the interface would need to be developed separately unless XPages is used.\n\n==Use==\nHCL Notes can be used for email, as a calendar, [[Personal information management|PIM]], instant messaging, [[Web browsing]], and other applications. Notes can access both local- and server-based applications and data.\n\nHCL Notes can function as an [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] and [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] email client with non-Domino mail servers. The system can retrieve recipient addresses from any [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] server, including [[Active Directory]], and includes a web browser, although it can be configured by a Domino Developer to launch a different web browser instead.\n\nFeatures include group calendars and schedules, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]]/[[MIME]]-based email, [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]-based news support, and automatic HTML conversion of all documents by the Domino [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] task.\n\nHCL Notes can be used with HCL Sametime instant-messaging to allow to see other users online and [[instant messaging|chat]] with one or more of them at the same time. Beginning with Release 6.5, this function has been freely available. [[presence information|Presence]] awareness is available in email and other IBM Domino applications for users in organizations that use both HCL Notes and IBM Sametime.\n\nSince version 7, Notes has provided a [[Web service]]s interface. Domino can be a [[Web server]] for [[HTML]] files; authentication of access to Domino databases or HTML files uses the HCL Domino user directory and external systems such as Microsoft Active Directory.\n\nA design client, HCL Domino Designer, can allow the development of [[database]] applications consisting of forms (which allow users to create documents) and views (which display selected document [[field (computer science)|fields]] in columns).\n\nIn addition to its role as a [[groupware]] system (email, calendaring, shared documents and discussions), HCL Notes and Domino can also construct \"workflow\"-type applications, particularly those which require approval processes and routing of data.\n\nSince Release 5, server clustering has had the ability to provide geographic redundancy for servers.\n\nNotes System Diagnostic (NSD) gathers information about the running of a Notes workstation or of a Domino server.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Speed\n| first1                = Tim\n| title                 = Upgrading to Lotus Notes and Domino 7\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=4J4IPaxR7n0C\n| series                = From technologies to solutions\n| publisher             = Packt Publishing Ltd\n| publication-date      = 2006\n| isbn                  = 9781847190499\n| accessdate            = 2014-04-21\n| quote                 = Notes System Diagnostic (NSD) is a Lotus tool designed to gather information about a Notes workstation or a Domino server.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOn October 10, 2018, IBM released IBM Domino v10.0 and IBM Notes 10.0 as the latest release. In December, 2019, HCL released HCL Domino v11 and HCL Notes v11. \n\n==Overview==\n\n===Client/server===\nHCL Notes and Domino is a [[NoSQL]] client/server database environment. The server software is called HCL Domino and the client software is HCL Notes. HCL Domino software can run on Windows, Unix, Linux, [[AIX]], and HCL mid-range systems and can scale to tens of thousands of users per server. There are different supported versions of the HCL Domino server that are supported on the various levels of server operating systems. Usually the latest server operating system is only officially supported by a version of HCL Domino that is released at about the same time as that OS.\n\nHCL Domino has security capabilities on a variety of levels. The authorizations can be granular, down to the field level in specific records all the way up to 10 different parameters that can be set up at a database level, with intermediate options in between. Users can also assign access for other users to their personal calendar and email on a more generic reader, editor, edit with delete and manage my calendar levels. All of the security in HCL Notes and Domino is independent of the server OS or Active Directory. Optionally, the HCL Notes client can be configured to have the user use their Active Directory identity.\n\n===Data replication===\nThe first release of IBM Notes included a generalized replication facility. The generalized nature of this feature set it apart from predecessors like [[Usenet]] and continued to differentiate IBM Notes.\n\nIBM Domino servers and Notes clients identify NSF files by their Replica IDs, and keep replicate files synchronized by bi-directionally exchanging data, metadata, and application logic and design. There are options available to define what meta-data replicate, or specifically exclude certain meta data from replicating. Replication between two servers, or between a client and a server, can occur over a network or a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] modem connection. Replication between servers may occur at intervals according to a defined schedule, in near-[[Real-time operating system|real-time]] when triggered by data changes in server clusters, or when triggered by an administrator or program.\n\nCreation of a local replica of an NSF file on the hard disk of an IBM Notes client enables the user to fully use IBM Notes and Domino databases while working off-line. The client synchronizes any changes when client and server next connect. Local replicas are also sometimes maintained for use while connected to the network in order to reduce network [[latency (engineering)|latency]]. Replication between an IBM Notes client and Domino server can run automatically according to a schedule, or manually in response to a user or programmatic request. Since Notes 6, local replicas maintain all security features programmed into the applications. Earlier releases of Notes did not always do so. Early releases also did not offer a way to [[encryption|encrypt]] NSF files, raising concerns that local replicas might expose too much confidential data on [[laptop]]s or insecure [[home office]] computers, but more recent releases offer encryption, and as of {{when|date=July 2015}} the default setting for newly created local replicas.\n\n===Security===\nIBM Notes was the first widely adopted software product to use [[public key cryptography]] for client\u2013server and server\u2013server authentication and for encryption of data. Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000, IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits. In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a \"workload reduction factor\" for the NSA. This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private-sector [[industrial espionage]], but not against spying by the US government.<ref>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/19.52.html#subj1 \"The Swedes discover Lotus Notes has key escrow!\"] ''The Risks Digest'', Volume 19, Issue 52, 1997-12-24</ref><ref>[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/2/2898/1.html Only NSA can listen, so that's OK] Heise, 1999.</ref> This implementation was widely announced, but with some justification many people did consider it to be a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]. Some governments objected to being put at a disadvantage to the NSA, and as a result Lotus continued to support the 40-bit version for export to those countries.\n\nUnder current US export laws, IBM Notes supports only one version of the Notes PKI with 128-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit public keys, and no workload reduction factor. The Domino server includes security tools support [[S/MIME]], [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] 3.0 with industry standard key sizes for HTTP and other [[Internet Protocol|Internet protocols]], [[X.509]] client certificates, and an integrated [[certificate authority]].\n\nIBM Notes and Domino also uses a code-signature framework that controls the security context, runtime, and rights of custom code developed and introduced into the environment. Notes 5 introduced an execution control list (ECL) at the client level. The ECL allows or denies the execution of custom code based on the signature attached to it, preventing code from untrusted (and possibly malignant) sources from running. Notes and Domino 6 allowed client ECLs to be managed centrally by server administrators through the implementation of policies. Since release 4.5, the code signatures listed in properly configured ECLs prevent code from being executed by external sources, to avoid [[computer virus|virus]] propagation through Notes/Domino environments. Administrators can centrally control whether each mailbox user can add exceptions to, and thus override, the ECL.\n\n===Database security===\nAccess control lists (ACLs) control a user of server's level of access to that database. Only a user with Manager access can create or modify the ACL. Default entries in the ACL can be set when the Manager creates the database.\n\nRoles, rather than user id, can determine access level.\n\n===Programming===\nIBM Notes and Domino is a cross-platform, distributed document-oriented [[NoSQL]] database and messaging framework and rapid application development environment that includes pre-built applications like email, calendar, etc. This sets it apart from its major commercial competitors, such as [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] or [[Novell GroupWise]], which are purpose-built applications for mail and calendaring that offer APIs for extensibility.\n\nIBM Domino databases are built using the IBM Domino Designer client, available only for [[Microsoft Windows]]; standard user clients are available for Windows, [[Linux]], and [[macOS]].<ref>Domino Designer clients available here http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ls/lsndad/</ref> A key feature of IBM Notes is that many replicas of the same database can exist at the same time on different servers and clients, across dissimilar platforms; the same storage architecture is used for both client and server replicas. Originally, replication in Notes happened at document (i.e., record) level. With release of Notes 4 in 1996, replication was changed so that it now occurs at field level.\n\nA database is a Notes Storage Facility (.nsf) file, containing basic units of storage known as a \"note\". Every note has a UniqueID that is shared by all its replicas. Every replica also has a UniqueID that uniquely identifies it within any cluster of servers, a domain of servers, or even across domains belonging to many organizations that are all hosting replicas of the same database. Each note also stores its creation and modification dates, and one or more Items.\n\nThere are several classes of notes, including design notes and document notes. Design notes are created and modified with the Domino Designer client, and represent programmable elements, such as the GUI layout of forms for displaying and editing data, or formulas and scripts for manipulating data. Document notes represent user data, and are created and modified with the Lotus Notes client, via a web browser, via mail routing and delivery, or via programmed code.\n\nDocument notes can have parent-child relationships, but IBM Notes should not be considered a hierarchical database in the classic sense of [[information management system]]s. Notes databases are also not [[Relational model|relational]], although there is a [[SQL]] driver that can be used with Notes, and it does have some features that can be used to develop applications that mimic relational features. IBM Notes does not support atomic transactions, and its [[file locking]] is rudimentary. IBM Notes is a [[document-oriented database]] (document-based, schema-less, loosely structured) with support for rich content and powerful indexing facilities. This structure closely mimics paper-based work flows that IBM Notes is typically used to automate.\n\nItems represent the content of a note. Every item has a name, a type, and may have some flags set. A note can have more than one item with the same name. Item types include Number, Number List, Text, Text List, Date-Time, Date-Time List, and Rich Text. Flags are used for managing attributes associated with the item, such as read or write security. Items in design notes represent the programmed elements of a database. For example, the layout of an entry form is stored in the rich text Body item within a form design note. This means that the design of the database can replicate to users' desktops just like the data itself, making it extremely easy to deploy updated applications.\n\nItems in document notes represent user-entered or computed data. An item named \"Form\" in a document note can be used to bind a document to a form design note, which directs the IBM Notes client to merge the content of the document note items with the GUI information and code represented in the given form design note for display and editing purposes. However, other methods can be used to override this binding of a document to a form note. The resulting loose binding of documents to design information is one of the cornerstones of the power of IBM Notes. Traditional database developers used to working with rigidly enforced schemas, on the other hand, may consider the power of this feature to be a double-edged sword.\n\nIBM Notes applications development uses several programming languages. [[Formula language|Formula]] and LotusScript are the two original ones. LotusScript is similar to, and may even be considered a specialized implementation of, Visual Basic, but with the addition of many native classes that model the IBM Notes environment, whereas Formula is similar to [[Lotus 1-2-3]] formula language but is unique to Notes.\n\nJava was integrated into IBM Notes beginning with Release 4.5. With Release 5, Java support was greatly enhanced and expanded, and [[JavaScript]] was added. While LotusScript remains a primary tool in developing applications for the Lotus Notes client, Java and JavaScript are the primary tools for server-based processing, developing applications for browser access, and allowing browsers to emulate the functionality of the IBM Notes client. With XPages, the IBM Notes client can now natively process Java and JavaScript code, although applications development usually requires at least some code specific to only IBM Notes or only a browser.\n\nAs of version 6, Lotus established an [[XML]] programming interface in addition to the options already available. The Domino XML Language (DXL) provides XML representations of all data and design resources in the Notes model, allowing any XML processing tool to create and modify IBM Notes and Domino data.\n\nSince Release 8.5, XPages were also integrated into IBM Notes.\n\nExternal to the IBM Notes application, IBM provides toolkits in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] to connect to the IBM Domino database and perform a wide variety of tasks. The C toolkit is the most mature, and the C++ toolkit is an objectized version of the C toolkit, lacking many functions the C toolkit provides. The Java toolkit is the least mature of the three and can be used for basic application needs.\n\n===Database===\nIBM Notes includes a [[database management system]] but IBM Notes files are different from relational or object databases because they are document-centric. [[Document-oriented database]]s such as IBM Notes allow multiple values in items (fields), do not require a [[database schema|schema]], come with built-in document-level access control, and store rich text data. IBM Domino 7 to 8.5.x supports the use of [[IBM DB2]] database as an alternative store for IBM Notes databases. This NSFDB2 feature, however, is now in maintenance mode with no further development planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21384421|title=IBM Support statement for Lotus Domino NSFDB2 - United States\n|date=January 10, 2017 |website=www-01.ibm.com |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref> An IBM Notes database can be mapped to a relational database using tools like DECS, [LEI], JDBCSql for Domino or NotesSQL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |title=NotesSQL |publisher=IBM |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602090000/http://www-142.ibm.com/software/sw-lotus/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/notessqlhome |archive-date=June 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIt could be argued that IBM Notes and Domino is a multi-value database system like [[Pick operating system|PICK]], or that it is an object system like [[Zope]], but it is in fact unique. Whereas the temptation for relational database programmers is to [[database normalization|normalize]] databases, Notes databases must be [[denormalization|denormalized]]. RDBMS developers often find it difficult to conceptualize the difference. It may be useful to think of an IBM Notes document (a 'note') as analogous to an XML document natively stored in a database (although with limitations on the data types and structures available).\n\nSince Lotus Notes 8.5, IBM started to change the term Database to Application, because of the reason that these files are not really object databases as mentioned above.\n\nThe benefits of this data structure are:\n# No need to define size of fields, or datatype;\n# Attributes (Notes fields) that are null take up no space in a database;\n# Built-in full text searching.\n\n===Configuration===\nThe IBM Domino server or the IBM Notes client store their configuration in their own databases / application files (*.nsf). No relevant configuration settings are saved in the Windows Registry if the operating system is Windows. Some other configuration options (primary the start configuration) is stored in the notes.ini (there are currently over 2000 known options available<ref>notes.ini Reference - by alphabet http://www.lntoolbox.com/en/notesini-reference.html</ref>).\n\n==Use as an email client==\nIBM Notes is commonly deployed as an end-user email client in larger organizations, with IBM claiming a cumulative 145 million {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} licenses sold to date.\n\nWhen an organization employs an IBM Domino server, it usually also deploys the supplied IBM Notes client for accessing the IBM Notes application for email and calendaring but also to use document management and workflow applications. As IBM Notes is a runtime environment, and the email and calendaring functions in IBM Notes are simply an application provided by IBM, the administrators are free to develop alternate email and calendaring applications. It is also possible to alter, amend or extend the IBM supplied email and calendaring application.\n\nThe IBM Domino server also supports [[POP3]] and [[IMAP]] mail clients, and through an extension product (IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook) supports native access for Microsoft Outlook clients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=ca&infotype=an&appname=iSource&supplier=877&letternum=ENUSZP16-0324 |title=IBM mail support for Microsoft Outlook, V2.0 expands mail client options for IBM Notes and IBM Domino |publisher=IBM \n|date=June 28, 2016  |accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIBM also provides IBM iNotes (in Notes 6.5 renamed to \"Domino Web Access\" but in version 8.0 reverted to iNotes), to allow the use of email and calendaring features through web browsers on Windows, Mac and Linux, such as [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Firefox]]. There are several spam filtering programs available (including IBM Lotus Protector), and a rules engine allowing user-defined mail processing to be performed by the server.\n\n===Comparison with other email clients===\nIBM Notes was designed as a collaborative application platform where email was just one of numerous applications that ran in the Notes client software. The Notes client was also designed to run on multiple platforms including [[Windows]], [[OS/2]], [[classic Mac OS]], SCO Open Desktop UNIX, and Linux. These two factors have resulted in the user interface containing some differences from applications that only run on Windows. Furthermore, these differences have often remained in the product to retain backward compatibility with earlier releases, instead of conforming to updated Windows UI standards. The following are some of these differences.\n* Properties dialog boxes for formatting text, hyperlinks and other rich-text information can remain open after a user makes changes to selected text. This provides flexibility to select new text and apply other formatting without closing the dialog box, selecting new text and opening a new format dialog box. Almost all other Windows applications require the user to close the dialog box, select new text, then open a new dialog box for formatting/changes.\n* Properties dialog boxes also automatically recognize the type of text selected and display appropriate selections (for instance, a hyperlink properties box).\n* Users can format tables as tabbed interfaces as part of form design (for applications) or within mail messages (or in rich-text fields in applications). This provides users the ability to provide tab-style organization to documents, similar to popular tab navigation in most web portals, etc.\n* End-users can readily insert links to IBM Notes applications, IBM Notes views or other IBM Notes documents into IBM Notes documents.\n* Deleting a document (or email) will delete it from every folder in which it appears, since the folders simply contain links to the same back-end document. Some other email clients only delete the email from the current folder; if the email appears in other folders it is left alone, requiring the user to hunt through multiple folders in order to completely delete a message. In IBM Notes, clicking on \"Remove from Folder\" will remove the document only from that folder leaving all other instances intact.\n* The ''All Documents'' and ''Sent'' \"views\" differ from other collections of documents known as \"folders\" and exhibit different behaviors. Specifically, mail cannot be dragged out of them, and so removed from those views; the email can only be \"copied\" from them. This is because these are ''views'', and their membership indexes are maintained according to characteristics of the documents contained in them, rather than based on user interaction as is the case for a ''folder''. This technical difference can be baffling to users, in environments where no training is given. ''All Documents'' contain all of the documents in a mailbox, no matter which folder it is in. The only way to remove something from ''All Documents'' is to delete it outright.\n\nLotus Notes 7 and older versions had more differences, which were removed from subsequent releases:\n* Users select a \"New Memo\" to send an email, rather than \"New Mail\" or \"New Message\". (Notes 8 calls the command \"New Message\")\n* To select multiple documents in a Notes view, one drags one's mouse next to the documents to select, rather than using {{keypress|\u21e7 Shift}}+single click. (Notes 8 uses keypress conventions.)\n* The searching function offers a \"phrase search\", rather than the more common \"or search\", and Notes requires users to spell out boolean conditions in search-strings. As a result, users must search for \"delete AND folder\" in order to find help text that contains the phrase \"delete a folder\". Searching for \"delete folder\" does not yield the desired result. (Notes 8 uses or-search conventions.)\n\nLotus Notes 8.0 (released in 2007) became the first version to employ a dedicated user-experience team,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/marybeth/entry/welcome_to_my_design_blog |title=Welcome to my \"design blog\"! |author=Mary Raven |publisher=IBM |date=April 18, 2006 |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref> resulting in changes in the IBM Notes client experience in the primary and new notes user interface. This new interface runs in the open source [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Framework, which is a project started by IBM, opening up more application development opportunities through the use of Eclipse plug-ins. The new interface provides many new user interface features and the ability to include user-selected applications/applets in small panes in the interface. Lotus Notes 8.0 also included a new email interface / design to match the new Lotus Notes 8.0 eclipse based interface. Eclipse is a Java framework and allows IBM to port Notes to other platforms rapidly. An issue with Eclipse and therefore Notes 8.0 is the applications start-up and user-interaction speed. Lotus Notes 8.5 sped up the application and the increase in general specification of PCs means this is less of an issue.\n\nIBM Notes 9 continued the evolution of the user interface to more closely align with modern application interfaces found in many commercial packaged or web-based software. Currently, the software still does not have an auto-correct option - or even ability - to reverse accidental use of caps lock.\n\nDomino is now running on the Eclipse platform and offers many new development environments and tools such as XPages.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.lifeit.co.uk/infrastructure/domino/training/\n| title = Lotus Notes & Domino Training - Life IT\n| website = www.lifeit.co.uk\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref>\n\nFor lower spec PCs, a new version of the old interface is still provided albeit as it is the old interface many of the new features are not available and the email user interface reverts to the Notes 7.x style.\n\nThis new user experience builds on Notes 6.5 (released in 2003), which upgraded the email client, previously regarded by many as the product's [[Achilles heel]]. Features added at that time included:\n* drag and drop of folders\n* replication of unread marks between servers\n* follow-up flags\n* reply and forward indicators on emails\n* ability to edit an attachment and save the changes back to an email id\n\n==Reception==\n{{Criticism section|date=June 2014}}\n\nPublications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006 have criticized earlier versions of Lotus Notes for having an \"unintuitive [user] interface\" and cite widespread dissatisfaction with the [[usability]] of the client software. ''The Guardian'' indicated that Notes has not necessarily suffered as a result of this dissatisfaction due to the fact that \"the people who choose [enterprise software] tend not to be the ones who use it.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1705106,00.html\n | title = Survival of the unfittest\n |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 2006-02-09\n| first=Charles\n| last=Arthur\n}}</ref>\n\nEarlier versions of Lotus Notes have also been criticized for violating an important usability best practice that suggests a consistent UI is often better than custom alternative. Software written for a particular [[operating system]] should follow that particular OS's [[user interface]] style guide. Not following those style guides can confuse users. A notable example is F5 keyboard shortcut, which is used to refresh window contents in Microsoft Windows. Pressing F5 in Lotus Notes before release 8.0 caused it to lock screen. Since this was a major point of criticism this was changed in release 8.0. Old versions did not support proportional scrollbars (which give the user an idea of how long the document is, relative to the portion being viewed).<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |title       = Lotus Notes Sucks\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120422075347/http://lotusnotessucks.4t.com/lnEx29.html\n |archive-date = 2012-04-22\n |df          = \n}}</ref> Proportional scroll bars were only introduced in Notes 8.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/updated-lotus-notes-hannover-screenshots#01252006042825PMPSCUCT.htm\n | title = Updated Lotus Notes \"Hannover\" screenshots (comment)\n}}</ref>\n\nOlder versions of Lotus Notes also suffered from similar user interaction choices, many of which were also corrected in subsequent releases. One example that was corrected in Release 8.5: In earlier versions the out-of-office agent needed to be manually enabled when leaving and disabled when coming back, even if start and end date have been set. As of Release 8.5 the out-of-office notification now automatically shuts off without a need for a manual disable.\n\nUnlike some other e-mail client software programs, IBM Notes developers made a choice to not allow individual users to determine whether a return receipt is sent when they open an e-mail; rather, that option is configured at the server level. IBM developers believe \"Allowing individual cancellation of return receipt violates the intent of a return receipt function within an organization\". So, depending on system settings, users will have no choice in return receipts going back to spammers or other senders of unwanted e-mail. This has led tech sites to publish ways to get around this feature of Notes. For IBM Notes 9.0 and IBM iNotes 9.0, the IBM Domino server's .INI file can now contain an entry to control return receipt in a manner that's more aligned with community expectations (IBM Notes 9 Product Documentation).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21241003\n | title = Is there a setting in Lotus Notes to control whether a return receipt is sent?\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/tip/Finding-and-disabling-hidden-return-receipts\n | title = Finding and disabling return receipts\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.mindwatering.net/SupportRef.nsf/b49d69a888845c8085256d220011d77b/37fdcce19aa1551685256929001226d1!OpenDocument\n | title = Techniques to Not Send a Return Receipt When Viewing Mail\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen IBM Notes crashes, some processes may continue running and prevent the application from being restarted until they are killed.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.virtualobjectives.com.au/notesdomino/killnotes.htm| title = KillNotes}}</ref>\n\n==Related software==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Related IBM Lotus products===\nOver the 30-year history of IBM Notes, Lotus Development Corporation and later IBM have developed many other software products that are based on or integrated with IBM Notes. The most prominent of these is the [[IBM Lotus Domino]] server software, which was originally known as the Lotus Notes Server and gained a separate name with the release of version 4.5. The server platform also became the foundation for products such as [[IBM Lotus Quickr|IBM Lotus Quickr for Domino]], for document management, and [[IBM Lotus Sametime|IBM Sametime]] for instant messaging, audio and video communication, and web conferencing, and with Release 8.5, [[IBM Connections]].\n\nIn early releases of IBM Notes, there was considerable emphasis on client-side integration with the [[IBM Lotus SmartSuite]] environment. With Microsoft's increasing predominance in office productivity software, the desktop integration focus switched for a time to [[Microsoft Office]]. With the release of version 8.0 in 2007, based on the Eclipse framework, IBM again added integration with its own office-productivity suite, the [[OpenOffice.org]]-derived [[IBM Lotus Symphony]]. [[IBM Lotus Expeditor]] is a framework for developing Eclipse-based applications.\n\nOther IBM products and technologies have also been built to integrate with IBM Notes. For mobile-device synchronization, this previously included the client-side [[IBM Lotus Easysync Pro]] product (no longer in development) and [[IBM Lotus Notes Traveler|IBM Notes Traveler]], a newer no-charge server-side add-on for mail, calendar and contact sync. A recent addition to IBM's portfolio are two [[IBM Lotus Protector]] products for mail security and encryption, which have been built to integrate with IBM Notes.\n\n===Related software from other vendors===\nWith a long market history and large installed base, IBM Notes and Domino have spawned a large third-party software ecosystem. Such products can be divided into four broad, and somewhat overlapping classes:\n\n* IBM Notes and Domino applications are software programs written in the form of one or more IBM Notes databases, and often supplied as NTF templates. This type of software typically is focused on providing business benefit from IBM Notes' core collaboration, workflow and messaging capabilities. Examples include customer relationship management (CRM), human resources, and project tracking systems. Some applications of this sort may offer a browser interface in addition to Notes client access. The code within these programs typically uses the same languages available to an in-house IBM Domino developer: IBM Notes formula language, [[LotusScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaScript]].\n* IBM Notes and Domino add-ons, tools and extensions are generally executable programs written in C, C++ or another compiled language that are designed specifically to integrate with IBM Notes and Domino. This class of software may include both client- and server-side executable components. In some cases, IBM Notes databases may be used for configuration and reporting. Since the advent of the Eclipse-based Notes 8 Standard client, client-side add-ons may also include Eclipse plug-ins and XML-based widgets. The typical role for this type of software is to support or extend core IBM Notes functionality. Examples include spam and anti-virus products, server administration and monitoring tools, messaging and storage management products, policy-based tools, data synchronization tools and developer tools.\n* IBM Notes and Domino-aware adds-ins and agents are also executable programs, but they are designed to extend the reach of a general networked software product to IBM Notes and IBM Domino data. This class includes server and client backup software, anti-spam and anti-virus products, and e-discovery and archiving systems. It also includes add-ins to integrate IBM Notes with third-party offerings such as Cisco [[WebEx]] conferencing service or the [[Salesforce.com]] CRM platform.\n\n==History==\nIBM Notes has a history spanning more than 30 years.<ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory Official history of Lotus Notes] IBM DeveloperWorks Web Site</ref> Its chief inspiration was ''PLATO Notes'', created by David R. Woolley at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1973. In today's terminology, PLATO Notes was a message board, and it was part of the foundation for an online community which thrived for more than 20 years on the [[PLATO system]].<ref>[https://archives.library.illinois.edu/e-records/index.php?dir=University%20Archives/0713010/ PLATO Notes Files, 1972-1976 (Record Series 7/13/10)], from the [https://archives.library.illinois.edu/archon/?p=collections/controlcard&id=5145 University of Illinois Archives]; this includes several years worth of transcripts of old notes files from the mid 1970s, recovered from very low quality printouts.</ref> [[Ray Ozzie]] worked with PLATO while attending the University of Illinois in the 1970s. When PC network technology began to emerge, Ozzie made a deal with [[Mitch Kapor]], the founder of [[Lotus Development Corporation]], that resulted in the formation of [[Iris Associates]] in 1984 to develop products that would combine the capabilities of PCs with the collaborative tools pioneered in PLATO. The agreement put control of product development under Ozzie and Iris, and sales and marketing under Lotus. In 1994, after the release and marketplace success of Notes R3, Lotus purchased Iris. In 1995 IBM purchased Lotus.\n\nIn 2008, IBM released [[XPages]] technology, based on [[JavaServer Faces]]. This allows IBM Domino applications to be better surfaced to browser clients, though the UX and business logic must be completely rewritten. Previously, IBM Domino applications could be accessed through browsers, but required extensive web specific modifications to get full functionality in browsers. XPages also give the application new capabilities that are not possible with the classic IBM Notes client. The IBM Domino 9 Social Edition included the IBM Notes Browser Plugin, which would surface Notes applications through a minified version of the rich desktop client contained in a browser tab.\n\n===Branding===\nPrior to release 4.5, the ''Lotus Notes'' branding encompassed both the client and server applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/ls-NDHistory/ |title=The History of Notes and Domino |publisher=IBM \n|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> In 1996, Lotus released an [[HTTP]] server add-on for the Notes 4 server called \"Domino\". This add-on allowed Notes documents to be rendered as web pages in real time. Later that year, the Domino web server was integrated into release 4.5 of the core Notes server and the entire server program was re-branded, taking on the name \"[[IBM Lotus Domino|Domino]]\". Only the client program officially retained the \"Lotus Notes\" name.\n\nIn November 2012, IBM announced it would  be dropping the Lotus brand and moving forward with the IBM brand only to identify products, including Notes and Domino.<ref>[http://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/ibm-drops-lotus-brand-takes-notes-and-domino-forward/ \"IBM Drops Lotus Brand, Takes Notes and Domino Forward\"] Article published in November, 2012</ref> On October 9, 2018, IBM announced the availability of the latest version of the client and server software.\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The only permanent river, the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], flows into a [[river delta|delta]] in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds\u2014called [[omuramba]]\u2014traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.\n\nA semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the [[Namib Desert]] to the west. There are small amounts of rainfall and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive {{convert|110|-|200|mm}} of rain per year,<ref name=\"SAltena\" /> and the wettest just a little over {{convert|500|mm}}. The surrounding [[Kalahari Basin]] covers over {{convert|2500000|km2}} extending further into Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, and encroaching into parts of [[Angola]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].\n\nNumerous pans exist within the Kalahari, including the [[Groot-vloer Pan]] and [[Verneukpan]] where evidence of a wetter climate exists in the form of former contouring for capturing of water. This and other pans, as well as river bottoms, were written about extensively at Sciforums by an article by Walter Wagner regarding the extensive formerly wet areas of the Kalahari. The Kalahari is extensive and extends further north where abandoned extensive roadways also exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciforums.com/threads/ancient-namibian-freeway-overlays-ancient-agriculture-system.158967/|title=Ancient Namibian Freeway overlays Ancient Agriculture System|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciforums.com|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{expand section|needs=Winter conditions, especially average and extreme temperatures; also add spring and fall averages; needs citations|date=December 2012}}\n\nNorth and east, approximately where the dry forests, savannahs and salt lakes prevail, the climate is sub-humid rather than semi-arid. South and west, where the vegetation is predominantly xeric savanna or even a semi-desert, the climate is \"Kalaharian\" [[semi-arid]]. The Kalaharian climate is subtropical (average annual temperature greater than or equal to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C, at peaks reaching 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and above, with mean monthly temperature of the coldest month strictly below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C), and is semi-arid with the dry season during the \"cold\" season, the coldest six months of the year. It is the southern tropical equivalent of the [[Sahel]]ian climate with the wet season during summer. The altitude has been adduced as the explanation why the Kalaharian climate is not tropical; its altitude ranges from 600 to 1600 meters (and generally from 800 to 1200 meters), resulting in a cooler climate than that of the Sahel or [[Sahara]]. For example, winter frost is common from June to August, something rarely seen in the warmer Sahelian regions.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Les milieux d\u00e9sertiques'', Jean Demangeot, Edmond Bernus, 2001. Editor: Armand Colin. {{ISBN|9782200251970}}, page 20 in particular.</ref> For the same reason, summer temperatures certainly can be very hot, but not in comparison to regions of low altitude in the Sahel or Sahara, where some stations record average temperatures of the warmest month around 38&nbsp;\u00b0C, whereas the average temperature of the warmest month in any region in the Kalahari never exceeds 29&nbsp;\u00b0C, though daily temperatures occasionally reach up to close to {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} (44.8&nbsp;\u00b0C at Twee Rivieren Rest Camp in 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/records.htm|title=World Record Temperatures -Highest Lowest Hottest Coldest temperatures-|website=www.mherrera.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gewitter in der Kalahari.jpg|thumb|Heavy [[thunderstorm]] near [[Stampriet]]]]\nThe dry season lasts eight months or more, and the wet season typically from less than one month to four months, depending on location. The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, in particular a small region located towards the west-southwest of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual rainfall ranging from around 110&nbsp;mm (close to aridity) to more than 500&nbsp;mm in some areas of the north and east. During summer time in all regions rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours of sunshine are recorded annually on average.\n\nIn the Kalahari, there are two main mechanisms of atmospheric circulation, dominated by the [[Kalahari High]] [[anticyclone]]:<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Tropicalit\u00e9 Jean Demangeot G\u00e9ographie physique intertropicale, pages 44\u201345, Figure 19, source: Leroux 1989.</ref>\n\n* The North and North-west of the Kalahari is subject to the alternation \"[[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ)/\"Continental [[Trade winds]]\". The ITCZ is the meeting area of the boreal trade winds with their austral counterparts what meteorologists call \"Meteorological equator\" and the sailors \"Doldrum\" or \"Pot-au-noir\" : the ITCZ generates rains in the wet season, whereas the continental trade winds cause the dry season;\n* The rest of the Kalahari is subject to the maritime trade winds, that largely shed their moisture as they cross up and over the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Southern African Great Escarpment]] before arriving over the Kalahari.\n\nThere are huge subterranean water reserves beneath parts of the Kalahari; the [[Dragon's Breath Cave]], for example, is the largest documented non-subglacial underground lake on the planet. Such reserves may be in part the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place.

The only permanent river, the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], flows into a [[river delta|delta]] in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds\u2014called [[omuramba]]\u2014traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.\n\nA semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the [[Namib Desert]] to the west. There are small amounts of rainfall and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive {{convert|110|-|200|mm}} of rain per year,<ref name=\"SAltena\" /> and the wettest just a little over {{convert|500|mm}}.

This and other pans, as well as river bottoms, were written about extensively at Sciforums by an article by Walter Wagner regarding the extensive formerly wet areas of the Kalahari.

South and west, where the vegetation is predominantly xeric savanna or even a semi-desert, the climate is \"Kalaharian\" [[semi-arid]]. The Kalaharian climate is subtropical (average annual temperature greater than or equal to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C, at peaks reaching 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and above, with mean monthly temperature of the coldest month strictly below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C), and is semi-arid with the dry season during the \"cold\" season, the coldest six months of the year. It is the southern tropical equivalent of the [[Sahel]]ian climate with the wet season during summer. The altitude has been adduced as the explanation why the Kalaharian climate is not tropical; its altitude ranges from 600 to 1600 meters (and generally from 800 to 1200 meters), resulting in a cooler climate than that of the Sahel or [[Sahara]]. For example, winter frost is common from June to August, something rarely seen in the warmer Sahelian regions.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Les milieux d\u00e9sertiques'', Jean Demangeot, Edmond Bernus, 2001.

The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, in particular a small region located towards the west-southwest of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual rainfall ranging from around 110&nbsp;mm (close to aridity) to more than 500&nbsp;mm in some areas of the north and east. During summer time in all regions rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours of sunshine are recorded annually on average.\n\nIn the Kalahari, there are two main mechanisms of atmospheric circulation, dominated by the [[Kalahari High]] [[anticyclone]]:<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Tropicalit\u00e9 Jean Demangeot G\u00e9ographie physique intertropicale, pages 44\u201345, Figure 19, source: Leroux 1989.</ref>\n\n* The North and North-west of the Kalahari is subject to the alternation \"[[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ)/\"Continental [[Trade winds]]\". The ITCZ is the meeting area of the boreal trade winds with their austral counterparts what meteorologists call \"Meteorological equator\" and the sailors \"Doldrum\" or \"Pot-au-noir\" : the ITCZ generates rains in the wet season, whereas the continental trade winds cause the dry season;\n* The rest of the Kalahari is subject to the maritime trade winds, that largely shed their moisture as they cross up and over the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Southern African Great Escarpment]] before arriving over the Kalahari.\n\nThere are huge subterranean water reserves beneath parts of the Kalahari; the [[Dragon's Breath Cave]], for example, is the largest documented non-subglacial underground lake on the planet. Such reserves may be in part the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place. The ancient [[Lake Makgadikgadi]] dominated the area, covering the Makgadikgadi Pan and surrounding areas, but it drained or dried out some 10,000 years ago.

[[Birds of prey]] include the secretary bird (''[[Sagittarius serpentarius]]''), martial eagle (''[[Polemaetus bellicosus]]'') and other eagles, the giant eagle owl (''[[Bubo lacteus]]'') and other owls, [[falcon]]s, [[goshawk]]s, [[kestrel]]s, and [[kite (bird)|kite]]s. Other animals include [[wildebeest]], [[springbok]] and other antelopes, [[porcupine]]s (''[[Hystrix africaeaustralis]]'') and [[ostrich]]es (''[[Struthio camelus]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1309|title=Kalahari xeric savanna  - Ecoregions - WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund}}</ref>\n\nSome of the areas within the Kalahari are seasonal [[wetland]]s, such as the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]] of [[Botswana]]. This area, for example, supports numerous [[halophilic]] species, and in the rainy season, tens of thousands of [[flamingo]]s visit these pans.<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008). [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22373&mode=&order=0 ''Makgadikgadi'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham].</ref>\n\nThe biggest threat to wildlife are the fences erected to manage herds of grazing cattle, a practice which also removes the plant cover of the savanna itself. Cattle ranchers will also poison or hunt down predators from the rangeland, particularly targeting jackals and wild dogs.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Protected areas==\nThe following protected areas were established in the Kalahari:\n*[[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park]]\n*[[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]]\n*[[Khutse Game Reserve]]\n*Tswalu Kalahari\n\n==Population==\n[[File:San-Mann beim Sammeln der Teufelskralle (Namibia).jpg|thumb|upright|San man collecting [[Harpagophytum|devil's claw]] (2017)]]\nThe [[San people]] have lived in the Kalahari for 20,000 years as [[hunter-gatherer]]s.<ref>{{Citation | last = Marshall | first = Leon | date = 16 April 2003 | title = Bushmen Driven From Ancestral Lands in Botswana | periodical = National Geographic News | place = Johannesburg | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0416_030416_san2_2.html | accessdate = 2009-04-22}}</ref> They hunt wild game with bows and poison arrows and gather edible plants, such as berries, melons and nuts, as well as insects. The San get most of their water requirements from plant roots and desert melons found on or under the desert floor. They often store water in the blown-out shells of ostrich eggs. The San live in huts built from local materials\u2014the frame is made of branches, and the roof is thatched with long grass. Most of their hunting and gathering techniques replicate our pre-historic tribes. Their mythology includes legends of a god Chikara, protecting them from starvation and death by sacrificing his own life by being hunted in the form of a deer and other wild game they hunt for food.  Bux is the enemy of Chikara and is in the form of snakes which are found in considerable numbers in the Kalahari desert region. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking [[Tswana people|Tswana]], [[Kgalagadi language|Kgalagadi]], and [[Herero people|Herero]] and a small number of European settlers also live in the Kalahari desert.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}. Tufts University. February 29, 2004.</ref> Although the original idea was that Spanish-language translations of articles from the English magazine would comprise half the content, ''People en Espa\u00f1ol'' over time came to have entirely original content.\n\nIn 2002, ''People'' introduced ''People Stylewatch'', a title focusing on celebrity style, [[fashion]], and beauty \u2013 a newsstand extension of its Stylewatch column.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}.
