However, in the absence of functional CFTR, the ENaC channel is upregulated, and further decreases salt and water secretion by reabsorbing sodium ions. As such, the respiratory complications in cystic fibrosis are not solely caused by the lack of chloride secretion but instead by the increase in sodium and water reabsorption.

They later recruited Hughes High School student and school friend Pat Strunk as the third voice. In the winter of 1963 Linda and Dorothy were with a group of teenage friends at the Tulu Club in Cincinnati. A Male singing group called the Squires had been performing at the Club for several weeks, but failed to show up on the night the group of friends were at the club.  Several of the members of the crowd of friends would sing Doo Wop songs (before it was called Doo-Wop) in the neighborhood Inwood Park.  When the Squires failed to show we talked Linda and Dorothy into singing A cappella to the songs we sang in the Park, and the whole place loved them.  They were spotted by musician/arranger George Bud Reneau, who then introduced them to his partner, songwriter,  Paul Trefzger. The trio signed with Bud and Paul's Saxony Records in 1964 along with the deal came fourth member, Wanda Sheriff. the now quartet recorded \"Tonight I'm Gonna Fall In Love\" / \"That's Why I'll Get By\" in the fall of 1964, It received local [[airplay]] in Cincinnati, and in other cities across the [[United States|US]]. The Teardrop's local success had them opening for [[The Beach Boys]] and [[Sonny and Cher]].\n\nIn early 1965, they followed up with \"Call Me and I'll Be Happy\", which featured Schroeder on lead. After the single's release, founding member Dyer decide to leave the group, and was replaced by Tinker Smiddy.  Their third single \"Tears Come Tumbling\" was granted national distribution by Musicor Records, who also issued their final single, \"I Will Love You Dear Forever\", in 1966.\n\nBy late 1966, other founding members, Sheriff and Strunk both left with Smiddy departing the group the following year. Dyer later returned to the group, rejoining Schroder along with two new members, Bobbie Frost and Susie Leight, for the final incarnation, until marriage and career changes caused the group to break up in 1969.\n\nBy the 1980s, all of the Teardrops recordings resurfaced on vinyl in the [[United Kingdom]], including the unreleased track \"Here Comes Loneliness\" which went on to become a [[Northern soul]] favorite along with the [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], \"Bubblegummer\", You Won't Be There, and \"I'm Gonna Steal Your Boyfriend\". In 2001, Saxony Records released a [[compact disc]] of all the Teardrops material.\n\nLinda Schroeder-Milazzo passed in 2003.  Dorothy Dyer-Wethington and her husband still live in Cincinnati.  Pat (Punkin) Strunk-Howard lives near lake Cumberland with her husband.  Wanda (Wendy) Sheriff-Engelhardt lives part-time in Cincinnati and part-time at her retirement cabin in Daniel Boone National Forest.  They reunited around 1989 for a reunion ball at the Clarion in Cincinnati, and performed various places for a few months.  Author John Clemente included The Teardrops in his book \"Girl Groups... Fabulous Females Who Rocked the World\", and The Teardrops performed at Yesteryears Club for the premier book signing at the release of his book.  Dorothy remained in Doo-Wop music the longest, still singing with groups in the Cincinnati Area.\n\n==Members==\n* Dorothy Dyer (1961\u20131965, 1967\u20131969)\n* Linda Schroeder (1961\u20131969)\n* Pat (Punkin) Strunk (1961\u20131966)\n* Wanda Wendy Sheriff (1964\u20131966)\n* Hazel \"Tinker\" Smiddy (1965\u20131967)\n* Bobbie Frost (1967\u20131969)\n* Susie Leight (1967\u20131969)\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n* \"Tonight I'm Gonna Fall In Love Again\" / \"That's Why I'll Get By\" - Saxony 1007 (1964)\n* \"I'm Gonna Steal Your Boyfriend\" / \"Call Me And I'll Be Happy\" - Saxony 1008 (1965)\n* \"Tears Come Tumbling\" / \"You Won't Be There\" - Saxony 1009\n* \"Tears Come Tumbling\" / \"You Won't Be There\" - Musicor 1139\n* \"I Will Love You Dear Forever\" / \"Bubblegummer\" - Musicor 1218 (1966)\n* \"Here Comes Loneliness\" (UK only) (1985)\n* \"I Will Love You Dear Forever\" / \"Bubblegummer\" - Saxony 2002 (1993)\n* \"Here Comes Loneliness\" / \"Walking Down Main Street\" - Saxony 3003 (2001)\n\n===Albums===\n* ''Girls About Town (You Won't Be There)'' (UK) - Impact 006 (1985)\n* ''The Best of The Teardrops'' - Saxony 101 (2001)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n^ Clemente, John (2000).

They later recruited Hughes High School student and school friend Pat Strunk as the third voice. In the winter of 1963 Linda and Dorothy were with a group of teenage friends at the Tulu Club in Cincinnati. A Male singing group called the Squires had been preforming at the Club for several weeks, but failed to show up on the night the group of friends were at the club.  Several of the members of the crowd of friends would sing Doo Wop songs (before it was called Doo-Wop) in the neighborhood Inwood Park.  When the Squires failed to show we talked Linda and Dorothy into singing A cappella to the songs we sang in the Park, and the whole place loved them.  They were spotted by musician/arranger George Bud Reneau, who then introduced them to his partner, songwriter,  Paul Trefzger. The trio signed with Bud and Paul's Saxony Records in 1964 along with the deal came fourth member, Wanda Sheriff. the now quartet recorded \"Tonight I'm Gonna Fall In Love\" / \"That's Why I'll Get By\" in the fall of 1964, It received local [[airplay]] in Cincinnati, and in other cities across the [[United States|US]]. The Teardrop's local success had them opening for [[The Beach Boys]] and [[Sonny and Cher]].\n\nIn early 1965, they followed up with \"Call Me and I'll Be Happy\", which featured Schroeder on lead. After the single's release, founding member Dyer decide to leave the group, and was replaced by Tinker Smiddy.  Their third single \"Tears Come Tumbling\" was granted national distribution by Musicor Records, who also issued their final single, \"I Will Love You Dear Forever\", in 1966.\n\nBy late 1966, other founding members, Sheriff and Strunk both left with Smiddy departing the group the following year. Dyer later returned to the group, rejoining Schroder along with two new members, Bobbie Frost and Susie Leight, for the final incarnation, until marriage and career changes caused the group to break up in 1969.\n\nBy the 1980s, all of the Teardrops recordings resurfaced on vinyl in the [[United Kingdom]], including the unreleased track \"Here Comes Loneliness\" which went on to become a [[Northern soul]] favorite along with the [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], \"Bubblegummer\", You Won't Be There, and \"I'm Gonna Steal Your Boyfriend\". In 2001, Saxony Records released a [[compact disc]] of all the Teardrops material.\n\nLinda Schroeder-Milazzo passed in 2003.  Dorothy Dyer-Wethington and her husband still live in Cincinnati.  Pat (Punkin) Strunk-Howard lives near lake Cumberland with her husband.  Wanda (Wendy) Sheriff-Engelhardt lives part-time in Cincinnati and part-time at her retirement cabin in Daniel Boone National Forest.  They reunited around 1989 for a reunion ball at the Clarion in Cincinnati, and performed various places for a few months.  Author John Clemente included The Teardrops in his book \"Girl Groups... Fabulous Females Who Rocked the World\", and The Teardrops performed at Yesteryears Club for the premier book signing at the release of his book.  Dorothy remained in Doo-Wop music the longest, still singing with groups in the Cincinnati Area.\n\n==Members==\n* Dorothy Dyer (1961\u20131965, 1967\u20131969)\n* Linda Schroeder (1961\u20131969)\n* Pat (Punkin) Strunk (1961\u20131966)\n* Wanda Wendy Sheriff (1964\u20131966)\n* Hazel \"Tinker\" Smiddy (1965\u20131967)\n* Bobbie Frost (1967\u20131969)\n* Susie Leight (1967\u20131969)\n\n==Discography==\n===Singles===\n* \"Tonight I'm Gonna Fall In Love Again\" / \"That's Why I'll Get By\" - Saxony 1007 (1964)\n* \"I'm Gonna Steal Your Boyfriend\" / \"Call Me And I'll Be Happy\" - Saxony 1008 (1965)\n* \"Tears Come Tumbling\" / \"You Won't Be There\" - Saxony 1009\n* \"Tears Come Tumbling\" / \"You Won't Be There\" - Musicor 1139\n* \"I Will Love You Dear Forever\" / \"Bubblegummer\" - Musicor 1218 (1966)\n* \"Here Comes Loneliness\" (UK only) (1985)\n* \"I Will Love You Dear Forever\" / \"Bubblegummer\" - Saxony 2002 (1993)\n* \"Here Comes Loneliness\" / \"Walking Down Main Street\" - Saxony 3003 (2001)\n\n===Albums===\n* ''Girls About Town (You Won't Be There)'' (UK) - Impact 006 (1985)\n* ''The Best of The Teardrops'' - Saxony 101 (2001)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n^ Clemente, John (2000).

Within the Spanish of Bolivia there are different regional varieties. In the border areas, Bolivia shares dialectal features with the neighboring countries.\n\nThroughout Bolivia the preservation of phonemic contrast between {{IPA|/\u029d/}} and the [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|/\u028e/}} (i.e. the absence of [[ye\u00edsmo]]) is the norm.<ref>Canfield 1981:28</ref><ref name=\"Lipski 1994:188\">Lipski 1994:188</ref> [[Debuccalization|Aspiration]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is frequent in the lowlands, while in the highlands the sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} tends to be preserved, realized either as a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] or, frequently, an [[Apical consonant|apical]] {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref name=\"Lipski 1994:188\" /><ref name=\"Canfield 1981:29\">Canfield 1981:29</ref> In highland dialects, the [[Trill consonant|\"trill\"]] phoneme (orthographic {{Graphreme|rr}} or word-initial {{grapheme|r}}) is often [[Assibilation|assibilated]], realized as a [[voiced apicoalveolar fricative]],<ref name=\"Canfield 1981:29\" /><ref>Lipski 1994:189</ref> or [[alveolar approximant]], which pronunciation is similar to the sound of {{Grapheme|r}} ({{IPAblink|\u0279}}) in English. In highland Bolivian Spanish there is \"intense reduction\" of unstressed vowels in contact with {{IPA|/s/}}, often resulting in syllables with {{IPA|/s/}} as their nucleus, e.g. ''pues'' (\"well,...\") pronounced {{IPA|[ps]}}.<ref name=\"Lipski 1994:188\" /><ref>Canfield 1981:29\u201330</ref>\n\n==Dialects of Spanish in Bolivia==\n[[File:Voseo en Bolivia.png|thumb|355x355px|{{legend|#000070 |Voseo widespread oral and written like the Rioplatense}}{{legend|#0077E5|Voseo widespread oral}}{{Legend|#A2D2FC|Voseo pronominal and oral imperative widespread, in writing coexist the ''vos'' and ''t\u00fa''}}{{legend|#8F8F8F|Voseo pronoun imperative oral written, verbal voseo gaining ground due to the proximity to Argentina}}]]\n\n===Andean Spanish===\n{{Main|Andean Spanish}}\n\n===Camba Spanish===\n\nThis variety of Spanish is spoken on the Chaco-Beni plain and in the Santa Cruz valleys, a region that includes the departments of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Department of Beni|Beni]], and [[Department of Pando|Pando]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Coimbra Sanz</ref> Spanish is spoken by almost the entire population of these regions, and\u2014like Spanish throughout the Americas\u2014has its basis in [[Andalusian Spanish]], but with influences of native languages such as [[Chiquitano]], [[Chan\u00e9 language|Chan\u00e9]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]], as well as Old World languages including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> And although it is fairly uniform across regions and social classes, there are subtle geographical differences.\n\nThis dialect is characterized by the [[debuccalization]] (\"aspiration\") of final {{IPA|/s/}}. For example, the word ''pues'' is pronounced {{IPA|[pweh]}}. For the second-person-singular pronoun and verb forms, the use of \"[[voseo]]\" is dominant. The use of [[diminutive]] ''&#8209;ingo'' and the [[augmentative]] ''&#8209;ango'' is unique to this dialect. For example: ''chiquitingo'' (\"very small\") and ''grandango'' (\"very large\").\n\n<!--This paragraph is hidden until its information can be repackaged in clear English. Begin here: The case of tropical regions of the departments of [[La Paz]] and [[Cochabamba]], there is almost a variety as in the regions of the [[Yungas]] and [[Chapare Province|Chapare]], it resembles the Andes and the valleys, further north merged with the Camba Spanish.-->\n\n===Chapaco Spanish===\nThis dialect is spoken mainly in the valleys and the [[Gran Chaco]] of the department of [[Tarija Department|Tarija]], but also in the region of [[Villa Abecia]] and [[Camargo, Chuquisaca|Camargo]] (in the department of [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]), in the province of [[Sud Chichas Province|Sud Chichas]] (capital [[Tupiza]]), and in the Chaco regions of Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz. \nThe second-person-singular [[voseo]] is in full use in [[Tupiza]], in the west of Tarija, and in the rest of the aforementioned areas.\nThe Chapaco accent has an intonation similar to that of Jujuy, Salta, and Tucum\u00e1n in Argentina, as the territory where it was spoken before was the [[province of Tarija|R\u00edo de la Plata Province of Tarija]].

Within the Spanish of Bolivia there are different regional varieties. In the border areas, Bolivia shares dialectal features with the neighboring countries.\n\nThroughout Bolivia the preservation of phonemic contrast between {{IPA|/\u029d/}} and the [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|/\u028e/}} (i.e. the absence of [[ye\u00edsmo]]) is the norm.<ref>Canfield 1981:28</ref><ref name=\"Lipski 1994:188\">Lipski 1994:188</ref> [[Debuccalization|Aspiration]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is frequent in the lowlands, while in the highlands the sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} tends to be preserved, realized either as a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] or, frequently, an [[Apical consonant|apical]] {{IPA|[s]}}.<ref name=\"Lipski 1994:188\" /><ref name=\"Canfield 1981:29\">Canfield 1981:29</ref> In highland dialects, the [[Trill consonant|\"trill\"]] phoneme (orthographic {{Graphreme|rr}} or word-initial {{grapheme|r}}) is often [[Assibilation|assibilated]], realized as a [[voiced apicoalveolar fricative]],<ref name=\"Canfield 1981:29\" /><ref>Lipski 1994:189</ref> or [[alveolar approximant]], which pronunciation is similar to the sound of {{Grapheme|r}} ({{IPAblink|\u0279}}) in English. In highland Bolivian Spanish there is \"intense reduction\" of unstressed vowels in contact with {{IPA|/s/}}, often resulting in syllables with {{IPA|/s/}} as their nucleus, e.g. ''pues'' (\"well,...\") pronounced {{IPA|[ps]}}.<ref name=\"Lipski 1994:188\" /><ref>Canfield 1981:29\u201330</ref>\n\n==Dialects of Spanish in Bolivia==\n[[File:Voseo en Bolivia.png|thumb|355x355px|{{legend|#000070 |Voseo widespread oral and written like the Rioplatense}}{{legend|#0077E5|Voseo widespread oral}}{{Legend|#A2D2FC|Voseo pronominal and oral imperative widespread, in writing coexist the ''vos'' and ''t\u00fa''}}{{legend|#8F8F8F|Voseo pronoun imperative oral written, verbal voseo gaining ground due to the proximity to Argentina}}]]\n\n===Andean Spanish===\n{{Main|Andean Spanish}}\n\n===Camba Spanish===\n\nThis variety of Spanish is spoken on the Chaco-Beni plain and in the Santa Cruz valleys, a region that includes the departments of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Department of Beni|Beni]], and [[Department of Pando|Pando]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Coimbra Sanz</ref> Spanish is spoken by almost the entire population of these regions, and\u2014like Spanish throughout the Americas\u2014has its basis in [[Andalusian Spanish]], but with influences of native languages such as [[Chiquitano]], [[Chan\u00e9 language|Chan\u00e9]] and [[Guarani language|Guarani]], as well as Old World languages including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> And although it is fairly uniform across regions and social classes, there are subtle geographical differences.\n\nThis dialect is characterized by the [[debuccalization]] (\"aspiration\") of final {{IPA|/s/}}. For example, the word ''pues'' is pronounced {{IPA|[pweh]}}. For the second-person-singular pronoun and verb forms, the use of \"[[voseo]]\" is dominant. The use of [[diminutive]] ''&#8209;ingo'' and the [[augmentative]] ''&#8209;ango'' is unique to this dialect. For example: ''chiquitingo'' (\"very small\") and ''grandango'' (\"very large\").\n\n<!--This paragraph is hidden until its information can be repackaged in clear English.
