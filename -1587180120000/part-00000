In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012). She has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including \"[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]\", \"[[Your Love Is My Drug]]\", \"[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]\", \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", \"[[Die Young (Kesha song)|Die Young]]\", \"[[My First Kiss]]\" with [[3OH!3]], and the chart-topping \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\", \"[[We R Who We R]]\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]\" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. \"Tik Tok\", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally. As of November 2019, the song has sold over 25 million copies. In 2020, Kesha released her fourth studio album [[High Road (Kesha album)|''High Road'']]. She has also written songs for other artists, including \"[[Till the World Ends]]\" for [[Britney Spears]] (2011).\n\nKesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v. Dr. Luke]]'', were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims [[breach of contract]] and [[defamation]] by Kesha.\n\nAs of 2019, Kesha has reportedly sold over 71 million records in the United States and over 134 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"PR Newswire\">{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-music-superstar-pitbull-to-host-the-2013-american-music-awards-on-sunday-november-24th-at-8-pm-etpt-on-abc-230672391.html|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The 2013 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 24th at 8 p.m. ETPT on ABC|author=|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|agency= PR Newswire|publisher=UBM pic|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101171769|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The \"2013 American Music Awards\u00ae\" on Sunday, November 24th At 8 PM ET/PT On ABC|author=|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> She was also listed as the 26th top artist on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]''{{'}}s decade end charts from 2010 to 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/top-artists-2010s|title=Billboard\u2019s Top Artists of the 2010s|website=Billboard|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> Kesha has received several awards and nominations, including her win for the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act]] in 2010.\n\n==Early life==\nKesha Rose Sebert was born in [[Los Angeles, California]] on March 1, 1987.

In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012). She has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including \"[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]\", \"[[Your Love Is My Drug]]\", \"[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]\", \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", \"[[Die Young (Kesha song)|Die Young]]\", \"[[My First Kiss]]\" with [[3OH!3]], and the chart-topping \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\", \"[[We R Who We R]]\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]\" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. \"Tik Tok\", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally.

She has also written songs for other artists, including \"[[Till the World Ends]]\" for [[Britney Spears]] (2011).\n\nKesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v.

He spent his entire club career at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers and was nicknamed \u201csilly\u201d after scoring 69 goals.F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

His association with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] began in 1938 when, after being encouraged by his school teacher to respond to a newspaper advertisement inviting boys for trials,<ref name=\"sstarball\"/> he was taken on as a member of their ground staff. He was only 14 years old when he made his debut for Wolves in a B team game against Walsall Wood in the Walsall Minor League.\n\nHe had been accepted on an eight-month trial by [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]], who initially told Wright he was \"too small\" but changed his mind.<ref name=\"sstarball\" /> He made his first team debut for the club aged just 15 in a 2\u20131 win at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in 1939. This game was played shortly after the start of World War II, so it is not counted as the official debut. His official debut came in the 1945\u201346 FA Cup in a two legged tie against [[Lovells Athletic F.C.|Lovells Athletic]].\n\nHe signed as a professional at 17, but the deepening effects of World War II soon forced Wolves to suspend competitive football.

A bad ankle break put his sporting career in doubt but he recovered, joined the army in 1943 as a physical training instructor,<ref name=\"obit1\" /> and played for Wolves whenever possible, making over 100 appearances in wartime football.\n\nHe became club captain soon after the end of the conflict, with the playing retirement of [[Stan Cullis]]. With Wright leading the team, they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title three times ([[1953\u201354 in English football|1953\u201354]], [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] and [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]) as well as the [[FA Cup]] in [[1949 FA Cup Final|1949]]. He was a virtual ever-present, missing only 31 games for Wolves during the 1950s. He retired from playing in 1959, a year before Wolves won another FA Cup. He made a total of 541 appearances both at and away from Molineux for Wolves.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:(Billy Wright).jpg|thumb|left|Wright at Wolves]] -->\n==International career==\nHis performances for club saw him earn a call-up to the [[England national football team|England team]]. He made his international debut on 19 January 1946 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a (post-war) '[[Victory International]]'. His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7\u20132 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with [[Bobby Moore]]). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed [[Bob Crompton]]'s [[Progression of England association football caps record|appearance record]] for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made  70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first football player in the world to earn 100 caps, and it was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, [[Bobby Charlton]]. As of present, Wright remains the ninth most capped player ever to have played for England being in possession of more caps than players such as [[Bryan Robson]], [[Kenny Sansom]], [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], [[Martin Peters]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Alan Shearer]].<ref name=England>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamplyrs/appsmost.html|title=England: Most Appearances|website=England Football Online.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio /><ref name=WWFC />\n\nHe retired as a player in August 1959. During his total of 105 games for England, his disciplinary record was excellent as he was never cautioned or sent off.\nThe football he was given at the end of his 100th international match, between England and Scotland on 11 April 1959 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], was due to be auctioned in May 2015 after being held by an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player who after an injury was unable to play professionally. The player had been given the ball by Wright's widow after being trialled by the club.<ref name=sstarball />\n\n==Managerial career==\nHe became manager of England's youth team in 1960, before being appointed manager of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1962, replacing [[George Swindin]]. Initially Arsenal started strongly under Wright, finishing seventh in [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] and [[1963\u201364 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|qualifying for Europe]] for the first time in their history, but failed to build on this. Wright enjoyed mixed success with his signings, who included successes such as [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], [[Joe Baker]] and [[Frank McLintock]], but also less successful players such as [[Ian Ure]].\n\nArsenal were unable to improve on their seventh in Wright's first season in charge, and their form gradually declined. Wright won only 38.46% of his matches in charge, the lowest rate for any [[post-war]] Arsenal manager (caretaker managers excepted). After a poor [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]] season \u2013 where Arsenal finished 14th and were knocked out of the [[FA Cup]] by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (who finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]) \u2014 Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966.\n\nFootball writer [[Brian Glanville]], discussing Billy Wright's time at Arsenal, wrote: \"he had neither the guile nor the authority to make things work and he reacted almost childishly to criticism\".<ref name=\"glanville\">{{cite web | url= http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm | author=[[Brian Glanville]] | title= Billy Wright or wrong? | publisher = tssonnet.com | year = 2003 | accessdate =13 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514225436/http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm |archivedate=14 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Life after football==\n[[File:BillyWrightStatue.jpg|thumbnail|Statue of Billy Wright outside Wolves' [[Molineux Stadium]]]]\n\nWright was a minor media personality, and his marriage to Joy Beverley of the [[Beverley Sisters]] occurred at a time long before the era of footballers being known for having celebrity girlfriends.

His association with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] began in 1938 when, after being encouraged by his school teacher to respond to a newspaper advertisement inviting boys for trials,<ref name=\"sstarball\"/> he was taken on as a member of their ground staff.

A bad ankle break put his sporting career in doubt but he recovered, joined the army in 1943 as a physical training instructor,<ref name=\"obit1\" /> and played for Wolves whenever possible, making over 100 appearances in wartime football.\n\nHe became club captain soon after the end of the conflict, with the playing retirement of [[Stan Cullis]]. With Wright leading the team, they won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title three times ([[1953\u201354 in English football|1953\u201354]], [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] and [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]) as well as the [[FA Cup]] in [[1949 FA Cup Final|1949]]. He was a virtual ever-present, missing only 31 games for Wolves during the 1950s. He retired from playing in 1959, a year before Wolves won another FA Cup. He made a total of 541 appearances both at and away from Molineux for Wolves.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:(Billy Wright).jpg|thumb|left|Wright at Wolves]] -->\n==International career==\nHis performances for club saw him earn a call-up to the [[England national football team|England team]]. He made his international debut on 19 January 1946 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a (post-war) '[[Victory International]]'. His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7\u20132 win against [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]]. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with [[Bobby Moore]]). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed [[Bob Crompton]]'s [[Progression of England association football caps record|appearance record]] for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made  70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first football player in the world to earn 100 caps, and it was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, [[Bobby Charlton]]. As of present, Wright remains the ninth most capped player ever to have played for England being in possession of more caps than players such as [[Bryan Robson]], [[Kenny Sansom]], [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], [[Martin Peters]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Alan Shearer]].<ref name=England>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamplyrs/appsmost.html|title=England: Most Appearances|website=England Football Online.com}}</ref><ref name=Bio /><ref name=WWFC />\n\nHe retired as a player in August 1959. During his total of 105 games for England, his disciplinary record was excellent as he was never cautioned or sent off.\nThe football he was given at the end of his 100th international match, between England and Scotland on 11 April 1959 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], was due to be auctioned in May 2015 after being held by an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player who after an injury was unable to play professionally. The player had been given the ball by Wright's widow after being trialled by the club.<ref name=sstarball />\n\n==Managerial career==\nHe became manager of England's youth team in 1960, before being appointed manager of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1962, replacing [[George Swindin]]. Initially Arsenal started strongly under Wright, finishing seventh in [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] and [[1963\u201364 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|qualifying for Europe]] for the first time in their history, but failed to build on this. Wright enjoyed mixed success with his signings, who included successes such as [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]], [[Joe Baker]] and [[Frank McLintock]], but also less successful players such as [[Ian Ure]].\n\nArsenal were unable to improve on their seventh in Wright's first season in charge, and their form gradually declined. Wright won only 38.46% of his matches in charge, the lowest rate for any [[post-war]] Arsenal manager (caretaker managers excepted). After a poor [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]] season \u2013 where Arsenal finished 14th and were knocked out of the [[FA Cup]] by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] (who finished bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]) \u2014 Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966.\n\nFootball writer [[Brian Glanville]], discussing Billy Wright's time at Arsenal, wrote: \"he had neither the guile nor the authority to make things work and he reacted almost childishly to criticism\".<ref name=\"glanville\">{{cite web | url= http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm | author=[[Brian Glanville]] | title= Billy Wright or wrong? | publisher = tssonnet.com | year = 2003 | accessdate =13 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514225436/http://www.tssonnet.com/tss2603/stories/20030118006710700.htm |archivedate=14 May 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Life after football==\n[[File:BillyWrightStatue.jpg|thumbnail|Statue of Billy Wright outside Wolves' [[Molineux Stadium]]]]\n\nWright was a minor media personality, and his marriage to Joy Beverley of the [[Beverley Sisters]] occurred at a time long before the era of footballers being known for having celebrity girlfriends.

The term generally applies to large snails whose shell has a high [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] and a noticeable [[siphonal canal]] (in other words, the shell comes to a noticeable point at both ends).\n\nIn [[North America]], a conch is often identified as a [[Lobatus gigas|queen conch]], indigenous to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Queen conchs are valued for seafood, and are also used as fish bait.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Animals|last=Walters|first=Martin|last2=Johnson|first2=Jinny|publisher=Marks and Spencer|year=2003|isbn=978-1-84273-964-8|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe group of conchs that are sometimes referred to as \"true conchs\" are [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Strombidae]], specifically in the genus ''[[Strombus]]'' and other closely related genera. For example, see ''[[Lobatus gigas]]'', the queen conch, and ''[[Laevistrombus canarium]]'', the dog conch.\n\nMany other species are also often called \"conch\", but are not at all closely related to the family Strombidae, including ''[[Melongena]]'' species (family [[Melongenidae]]), and the horse conch ''[[Triplofusus papillosus]]'' (family [[Fasciolariidae]]). Species commonly referred to as conchs also include the sacred chank or more correctly ''[[shankha]]'' shell (''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'') and other ''Turbinella'' species in the family [[Turbinellidae]]. [[Triton]]'s Trumpet (Family [[Charoniidae]]) may also be fashioned into a horn and referred to as a conch.

All parts of the conch meat are edible.<ref name=\"conchasfood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foodreference.com/html/artconch.html|title= Conch}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}</ref> \n\nConch is indigenous to the Bahamas, and is typically served in fritter, salad, and soup forms. Conch is also eaten in the [[West Indies]] ([[Jamaica]] in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in soups, stews, and curries. Restaurants all over the islands serve this particular meat. In the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], and [[Haiti]], conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as ''lambi''. In [[the Turks and Caicos Islands]], the Annual Conch Festival is held in November each year, located at the Three Queens Bar/Restaurant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for the best and most original conch dishes, which are then judged by international chefs. Free sampling of the dishes follows the judging; along with those festivities, other competitions, events, and music performances occur well into the evening.<ref>[http://www.conchfestival.com Turks & Caicos Conch Festival].</ref> In [[Puerto Rico]], conch is served as a ''[[ceviche]]'', often called ''ensalada de carrucho'' (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions. It is also used to fill ''[[empanada]]s''.\n\nIn [[Panama]], conch is known as ''cambombia'' and is often served as  ''ceviche de cambombia'' consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, chopped onions, finely chopped [[habanero]]s, and often vinegar.\n\nConch is very popular in [[Italy]] and among [[Italian Americans]]. Called ''scungille'' (pl. ''scungilli''), it is eaten in a variety of ways, but most often in salads or cooked in a sauce for pasta. It is often included as one of the dishes prepared for the [[Feast of the Seven Fishes]].  \n\nIn East Asian cuisines, this [[seafood]] is often cut into thin slices and then [[Steaming|steamed]] or [[stir-frying|stir-fried]].\n\nEighty-percent of the queen conch meat in international trade is imported into the United States. The [[Florida Keys]] were a major source of queen conchs until the 1970s, but the conchs are now scarce and all harvesting of them in Florida waters is prohibited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/international/animals/queen-conch.html|title=Queen Conch|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: International Affairs|access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Musical instruments==\n{{main article|Conch (instrument)}}\nConch shells can be used as [[wind instrument]]s. They are prepared by cutting a hole in the [[spire (mollusc)|spire]] of the shell near the [[apex (mollusc)|apex]], and then blowing into the shell as if it were a trumpet, as in [[blowing horn]]. Sometimes, a mouthpiece is used, but some shell trumpets are blown without one. Pitch is adjusted by moving one's hand in and out of the aperture; the deeper the hand, the lower the note.\n\nVarious species of large marine [[gastropod shell]]s can be turned into \"blowing shells\", but some of the best-known species used are the sacred chank or ''shankha'' ''Turbinella pyrum'', the Triton's trumpet ''[[Charonia tritonis]]'', and the queen conch ''[[Strombus gigas]]''.\n\nExamples of this practice in the Americas can be seen in the form of historical artifacts at the [https://www.museolarco.org/en/exhibition/permanent-exhibition/online-exhibition/ritual-warfare-and-music/ceremonial-trumpet-or-pututo-and-whistles/ Museo Larco] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] and [https://www.mna.inah.gob.mx/ Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]].\n\n==Pearls==\n[[File:Tiffany and Company - Sautoir with Pearl Pendant - Walters 572034.jpg|thumb|Conch pearl necklace]]\nMany different kinds of mollusks can produce [[pearl]]s.

The microstructure of conch pearls comprises partly aligned bundles of microcrystalline fibres that create a shimmering, slightly [[iridescence|iridescent]] effect known as \"flame structure\".

Conch is also eaten in the [[West Indies]] ([[Jamaica]] in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in soups, stews, and curries. Restaurants all over the islands serve this particular meat. In the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], and [[Haiti]], conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as ''lambi''. In [[the Turks and Caicos Islands]], the Annual Conch Festival is held in November each year, located at the Three Queens Bar/Restaurant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for the best and most original conch dishes, which are then judged by international chefs. Free sampling of the dishes follows the judging; along with those festivities, other competitions, events, and music performances occur well into the evening.<ref>[http://www.conchfestival.com Turks & Caicos Conch Festival].</ref> In [[Puerto Rico]], conch is served as a ''[[ceviche]]'', often called ''ensalada de carrucho'' (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions. It is also used to fill ''[[empanada]]s''.\n\nIn [[Panama]], conch is known as ''cambombia'' and is often served as  ''ceviche de cambombia'' consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, chopped onions, finely chopped [[habanero]]s, and often vinegar.\n\nConch is very popular in [[Italy]] and among [[Italian Americans]]. Called ''scungille'' (pl. ''scungilli''), it is eaten in a variety of ways, but most often in salads or cooked in a sauce for pasta. It is often included as one of the dishes prepared for the [[Feast of the Seven Fishes]].  \n\nIn East Asian cuisines, this [[seafood]] is often cut into thin slices and then [[Steaming|steamed]] or [[stir-frying|stir-fried]].\n\nEighty-percent of the queen conch meat in international trade is imported into the United States. The [[Florida Keys]] were a major source of queen conchs until the 1970s, but the conchs are now scarce and all harvesting of them in Florida waters is prohibited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/international/animals/queen-conch.html|title=Queen Conch|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: International Affairs|access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Musical instruments==\n{{main article|Conch (instrument)}}\nConch shells can be used as [[wind instrument]]s.

Sometimes, a mouthpiece is used, but some shell trumpets are blown without one. Pitch is adjusted by moving one's hand in and out of the aperture; the deeper the hand, the lower the note.\n\nVarious species of large marine [[gastropod shell]]s can be turned into \"blowing shells\", but some of the best-known species used are the sacred chank or ''shankha'' ''Turbinella pyrum'', the Triton's trumpet ''[[Charonia tritonis]]'', and the queen conch ''[[Strombus gigas]]''.\n\nExamples of this practice in the Americas can be seen in the form of historical artifacts at the [https://www.museolarco.org/en/exhibition/permanent-exhibition/online-exhibition/ritual-warfare-and-music/ceremonial-trumpet-or-pututo-and-whistles/ Museo Larco] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] and [https://www.mna.inah.gob.mx/ Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]].\n\n==Pearls==\n[[File:Tiffany and Company - Sautoir with Pearl Pendant - Walters 572034.jpg|thumb|Conch pearl necklace]]\nMany different kinds of mollusks can produce [[pearl]]s.

The revolutionary wave began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]], and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America.  Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among the revolutionaries in different countries.  Six factors were involved: widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership; demands for more participation in government and democracy; demands for freedom of the press; the demands of the working classes; the upsurge of nationalism; and finally, the regrouping of the reactionary forces based on the royalty, the aristocracy, the army, and the peasants.<ref>R.J.W.

Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more forced into exile. The only significant lasting reforms were the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Austria and Hungary, the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in Denmark and the definitive end of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian monarchy]] in France.

The region included all of the modern American states of [[California]], [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]], and parts of [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\nThe [[United States]], embarked on the [[Conquest of California]] in an early military campaign of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in Alta California. The California Campaign was marked by a series of small battles throughout 1846 and early 1847.  The [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed on January 13, 1847, and essentially terminated hostilities in Alta California. Shortly thereafter, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] was appointed Governor of the new [[California]] Territory, and [[Yerba Buena, California]], was renamed [[San Francisco]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed in February 1848, marked the end of the Mexican\u2013American War. By the terms of the treaty, [[Mexican Cession|Mexico formally ceded]] Alta California along with its other northern territories east through [[Texas]], receiving [[USD|$]]15,000,000 in exchange. This largely unsettled territory constituted nearly half of its claimed territory with about 1% of its then population of about 4,500,000.<ref>Note: A new international boundary was drawn; [[San Diego Bay]] is one of the only two main natural harbours in California south of [[San Francisco Bay]];  the border was aligned from one Spanish league south of San Diego Bay east to the [[Gila River]] \u2013 [[Colorado River]] confluence, to include strategic San Diego and its harbour.</ref><ref>Two years after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, U.S. statehood was granted in 1850.</ref>  \n\nThe discovery of gold in [[Northern California]] (and subsequent discourse about that discovery in 1848) led to the [[California Gold Rush]]. In October 1848, the [[SS California (1848)|SS ''California'']] left [[New York Harbor]], rounded [[Cape Horn]] at the tip of South America, and arrived in [[San Francisco]] after the 4-month-21-day journey.  Thereafter, regular [[steamboat]] service continued from the west to the east coast of the United States.  During 1848, only an estimated 6,000 to 6,500 people travelled to California to seek gold that year.<ref name=\"Starr48\">Starr, Kevin and Orsi, Richard J. (eds.)

The following year, an ambassador from Texas approached the United States about the possibility of becoming an American state.  Fearing a war with Mexico, which did not recognize Texas independence, the United States declined the offer.<ref>Richard Bruce Winders, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&printsec=frontcover ''Crisis in the Southwest: The United States, Mexico, and the Struggle over Texas''] (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2002), p. 41.</ref>  \n\nIn 1844, [[James K. Polk]] was elected the United States president after promising to annex Texas.  Before he assumed office, the outgoing president, [[John Tyler]], entered negotiations with Texas.  On February 26, 1845, six days before Polk took office, the U.S. Congress approved the annexation.  The Texas legislature approved the annexation in July 1845 and constructed a [[Constitution of the State of Texas|state constitution]].  In October, Texas residents approved the annexation and the new constitution, and Texas was officially inducted into the United States on December 29, 1845 as the 28th U.S. state..<ref>Fehrenbach, ''Lone Star'', pp. 264&#x2013;267</ref> Mexico still considered Texas to be a renegade Mexican state, and never considered land south of the [[Nueces River]] to be part of Texas. This border dispute between the newly-expanded United States and Mexico triggered the [[#Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican\u2013American War]]. \n\nWhen the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States. Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the [[Compromise of 1850]], in which Texas ceded some of its territories to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso.\n\n==== Mexican\u2013American War ====\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}[[File: Battle Molino del Rey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mexican\u2013American War]]]][[Territorial expansion of the United States|American territorial expansion]] to the [[Pacific coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] was a major goal of U.S. President [[James K.

Mexico did not accept the annexation, while also continuing to claim the [[Nueces River]] as its border with Texas<s>,</s> and also still considering Texas to be a province of Mexico. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] sent troops to the disputed area, and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces [[Thornton Affair|attacked American forces]], the U.S. declared the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848).\n\nCombat operations lasted a year and a half, from the spring of 1846 to the fall of 1847. U.S. forces quickly occupied the capital town of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] along the upper Rio Grande and began the [[Conquest of California]] in Mexico's [[Alta California]] Department. They then invaded to the south into parts of central Mexico (modern-day northeastern Mexico and northwest Mexico). Meanwhile, the [[Pacific Squadron]] of the [[United States Navy]] conducted a blockade and took control of several garrisons on the [[the Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast farther south in lower [[Baja California Territory]]. The U.S. Army eventually captured the capital [[Mexico City]], having marched west from the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], where the Americans staged their first amphibious landing on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast.\n\nThe 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], forced onto the remnant Mexican government, ended the war and specified its major consequence, the [[Mexican Cession]] of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15 million compensation for the physical damage of the war. In addition, the United States assumed $3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of their province, later the Republic of Texas (and now the [[Texas|State of Texas]]), and thereafter cited and acknowledged the Rio Grande as its future northern national border with the United States. Including Texas, Mexico ceded an area of approximately {{convert|2500000|km2}} \u2013 by its terms, around 55% of its former national territory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=26|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)}}</ref>\n\n==== Mexico ====\n{{See also|Territorial evolution of Mexico|Centralist Republic of Mexico|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna}}\nThe 1840s for Mexico were the end of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] and the waning years the \"Age of Santa Anna\". In 1834, President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] dissolved Congress, forming a new government. That government instituted the new Centralist Republic of Mexico by approving a new centralist constitution (\"[[Siete Leyes]]\"), From its formation in 1835 until its dissolution in 1846, the Centralist Republic was governed by eleven [[President of Mexico|presidents]] (none of which finished their term). It called for the state militias to disarm, but many states resisted, including [[Mexican Texas]], which won its independence in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836.  \n\nThe [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] declared its independence from Mexico in January 1840. However, the border with Texas was never determined (whether the [[Nueces River]] or the [[Rio Grande]]). The new Republic fought a brief and unsuccessful war for independence, returning to Mexico late in the year.  \n\nIn 1841, Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] and [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Paredes]] led a rebellion against [[Anastasio Bustamante|President  Bustamante]], resulting in Santa Anna becoming president of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] for a fifth time . Local officials in Yucat\u00e1n declared independence in 1841, opposing strong autocratic rule and demanding the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], thus establishing the second [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]].  \n\nIn 1842, the region of [[Soconusco]] was annexed by Mexico as part of the state of [[Chiapas]], following the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].  \n\nIn 1846, [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|President Paredes]] and the Congress of Mexico declared war at the beginning of the Mexican\u2013American War. Paredes' presidential successor was deposed in a coup, replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas]].  Salas issued a new decree that restored the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], ending the Centralist Republic and beginning the [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico]]. After the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] became the second president of Mexico to finish his term (Mexico's first president completed his in 1829). It was during this time that Yucat\u00e1n reunited with Mexico.  A decisive factor for the reunion was the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]] (a revolt by the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population) for which Yucat\u00e1n initially sought help from Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but ultimately reunited with Mexico for help. \n\nHerrera peacefully turned over the presidency to the winner of the Federal Elections of 1850, General [[Mariano Arista]].

The revolutionary wave began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]], and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America.  Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among the revolutionaries in different countries.  Six factors were involved: widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership; demands for more participation in government and democracy; demands for freedom of press; the demands of the working classes; the upsurge of nationalism; and finally, the regrouping of the reactionary forces based on the royalty, the aristocracy, the army, and the peasants.<ref>R.J.W.

Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more forced into exile. The only significant lasting reforms were the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Austria and Hungary, the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in Denmark, and the definitive end of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian monarchy]] in France.

The region included all of the modern American states of [[California]], [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]], and parts of [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\nThe [[United States]], embarked on the [[Conquest of California]] in an early military campaign of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in Alta California. The California Campaign was marked by a series of small battles throughout 1846 and early 1847.  The [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed on January 13, 1847, and essentially terminated hostilities in Alta California. Shortly thereafter, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] was appointed Governor of the new [[California]] Territory, and [[Yerba Buena, California]], was renamed [[San Francisco]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed in February 1848, marked the end of the Mexican\u2013American War. By the terms of the treaty, [[Mexican Cession|Mexico formally ceded]] Alta California along with its other northern territories east through [[Texas]], receiving [[USD|$]]15,000,000 in exchange. This largely unsettled territory constituted nearly half of its claimed territory with about 1% of its then population of about 4,500,000.<ref>Note: A new international boundary was drawn; [[San Diego Bay]] is one of the only two main natural harbors in California south of [[San Francisco Bay]];  the border was aligned from one Spanish league south of San Diego Bay east to the [[Gila River]] \u2013 [[Colorado River]] confluence, to include strategic San Diego and its harbor.</ref><ref>Two years after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, U.S. statehood was granted in 1850.</ref>  \n\nThe discovery of gold in [[Northern California]] (and subsequent discourse about that discovery in 1848) led to the [[California Gold Rush]]. In October 1848, the [[SS California (1848)|SS ''California'']] left [[New York Harbor]], rounded [[Cape Horn]] at the tip of South America, and arrived in [[San Francisco]] after the 4-month-21-day journey.  Thereafter, regular [[steamboat]] service continued from the west to the east coast of the United States.  During 1848, only an estimated 6,000 to 6,500 people traveled to California to seek gold that year.<ref name=\"Starr48\">Starr, Kevin and Orsi, Richard J. (eds.)

The following year, an ambassador from Texas approached the United States about the possibility of becoming an American state.  Fearing a war with Mexico, which did not recognize Texas independence, the United States declined the offer.<ref>Richard Bruce Winders, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&printsec=frontcover ''Crisis in the Southwest: The United States, Mexico, and the Struggle over Texas''] (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2002), p. 41.</ref>  \n\nIn 1844, [[James K. Polk]] was elected the United States president after promising to annex Texas.  Before he assumed office, the outgoing president, [[John Tyler]], entered negotiations with Texas.  On February 26, 1845, six days before Polk took office, the U.S. Congress approved the annexation.  The Texas legislature approved annexation in July 1845 and constructed a [[Constitution of the State of Texas|state constitution]].  In October, Texas residents approved the annexation and the new constitution, and Texas was officially inducted into the United States on December 29, 1845 as the 28th U.S. state..<ref>Fehrenbach, ''Lone Star'', pp. 264&#x2013;267</ref> Mexico still considered Texas to be a renegade Mexican state, and never considered land south of the [[Nueces River]] to be part of Texas. This border dispute between the newly-expanded United States and Mexico triggered the [[#Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican\u2013American War]]. \n\nWhen the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States. Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the [[Compromise of 1850]], in which Texas ceded some of its territory to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso.\n\n==== Mexican\u2013American War ====\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}[[File:Battle Molino del Rey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mexican\u2013American War]]]][[Territorial expansion of the United States|American territorial expansion]] to the [[Pacific coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] was a major goal of U.S. President [[James K.

Mexico did not accept the annexation, while also continuing to claim the [[Nueces River]] as its border with Texas<s>,</s> and also still considering Texas to be a province of Mexico. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] sent troops to the disputed area, and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces [[Thornton Affair|attacked American forces]], the U.S. declared the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848).\n\nCombat operations lasted a year and a half, from the spring of 1846 to the fall of 1847. U.S. forces quickly occupied the capital town of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] along the upper Rio Grande and began the [[Conquest of California]] in Mexico's [[Alta California]] Department. They then invaded to the south into parts of central Mexico (modern-day northeastern Mexico and northwest Mexico). Meanwhile, the [[Pacific Squadron]] of the [[United States Navy]] conducted a blockade and took control of several garrisons on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast farther south in lower [[Baja California Territory]]. The U.S. Army eventually captured the capital [[Mexico City]], having marched west from the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], where the Americans staged their first amphibious landing on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast.\n\nThe 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], forced onto the remnant Mexican government, ended the war and specified its major consequence, the [[Mexican Cession]] of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15 million compensation for the physical damage of the war. In addition, the United States assumed $3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of their province, later the Republic of Texas (and now the [[Texas|State of Texas]]), and thereafter cited and acknowledged the Rio Grande as its future northern national border with the United States. Including Texas, Mexico ceded an area of approximately {{convert|2500000|km2}} \u2013 by its terms, around 55% of its former national territory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=26|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)}}</ref>\n\n==== Mexico ====\n{{See also|Territorial evolution of Mexico|Centralist Republic of Mexico|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna}}\nThe 1840s for Mexico were the end of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] and the waning years the \"Age of Santa Anna\". In 1834, President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] dissolved Congress, forming a new government. That government instituted the new Centralist Republic of Mexico by approving a new centralist constitution (\"[[Siete Leyes]]\"), From its formation in 1835 until its dissolution in 1846, the Centralist Republic was governed by eleven [[President of Mexico|presidents]] (none of which finished their term). It called for the state militias to disarm, but many states resisted, including [[Mexican Texas]], which won its independence in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836.  \n\nThe [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] declared its independence from Mexico in January 1840. However, the border with Texas was never determined (whether the [[Nueces River]] or the [[Rio Grande]]). The new Republic fought a brief and unsuccessful war for independence, returning to Mexico late in the year.  \n\nIn 1841, Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] and [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Paredes]] led a rebellion against [[Anastasio Bustamante|President  Bustamante]], resulting in Santa Anna becoming president of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] for a fifth time . Local officials in Yucat\u00e1n declared independence in 1841, opposing strong autocratic rule and demanding the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], thus establishing the second [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]].  \n\nIn 1842, the region of [[Soconusco]] was annexed by Mexico as part of the state of [[Chiapas]], following the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].  \n\nIn 1846, [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|President Paredes]] and the Congress of Mexico declared war at the beginning of the Mexican\u2013American War. Paredes' presidential successor was deposed in a coup, replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas]].  Salas issued a new decree that restored the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], ending the Centralist Republic and beginning the [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico]]. After the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] became the second president of Mexico to finish his term (Mexico's first president completed his in 1829). It was during this time that Yucat\u00e1n reunited with Mexico.  A decisive factor for the reunion was the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]] (a revolt by the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population) for which Yucat\u00e1n initially sought help from Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but ultimately reunited with Mexico for help. \n\nHerrera peacefully turned over the presidency to the winner of the Federal Elections of 1850, General [[Mariano Arista]].  Despite being exiled from Mexico in 1848, Santa Anna would [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna#President for the last time|return to the presidency one last time]] during the [[1850s]]. \n\n==== El Salvador ====\n* February \u2013 [[El Salvador]] proclaims itself an independent republic, bringing an end to the (already ''de facto'' defunct) [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\n==== Nicaragua ====\n\n==== Costa Rica ====\n\n==== Puerto Rico ====\n\n==== Honduras ====\n\n=== Caribbean ===\n\n==== Barbados ====\n* [[June 6]], [[1843]] \u2013 In [[Barbados]], [[Samuel Jackman Prescod]] is the first non-white person elected to the House of Assembly.\n\n==== Dominican Republic ====\n* [[February 27]], [[1844]] \u2013 The [[Dominican Republic]] gains independence from [[Haiti]].\n* [[November 6]], [[1844]] \u2013 The [[Dominican Republic]] drafts its first [[Constitution]].\n\n==== Haiti ====\n* [[March 1]], [[1847]] \u2013 [[Faustin Soulouque]] declares himself [[Emperor]] of [[Haiti]].\n\n==== Trinidad ====\n* [[May 30]], [[1845]] \u2013 ''[[Fatel Razack]]'' (''Fath Al Razack'', \"Victory of Allah the Provider\", [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0642\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0642) is the first ship to bring indentured labourers from [[India]] to [[Trinidad]], landing in the [[Gulf of Paria]] with 227 immigrants.<ref>When the British decided they were going to bring Indians to Trinidad this year, most of the traditional British ship owners did not wish to be involved.

According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.

Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man, and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent.

Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy.

According to Leland, after dividing herself into light and darkness:\n:\"...Diana saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire. Wishing to receive the light again into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire. This desire was the Dawn.

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is \"[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]\".)<ref name=Kohler1923/> --> Similarly the [[Vulgate]] renders \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc in [[Latin]] as ''Lucifer'', the name in that language for the morning star. According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.

Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man, and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.<ref name=Laney/><ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}</ref>\n\nFor the unnamed<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 |title=Isaiah: God's Poet of Light |author=Carol J.

Christus Filius tuus, qui, regressus ab inferis, humano generi serenus illuxit, et vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum'' (\"May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death's domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever\").

Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious/philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.\n\n===Luciferianism===\n[[Luciferianism]] is a belief structure that venerates the fundamental traits that are attributed to Lucifer.

In what is known as the [[Taxil hoax]], he alleged that leading Freemason [[Albert Pike]] had addressed \"The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world\" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god [[Adonai]].  Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxil_confessed.html |title=Leo Taxil's confession |publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |date=2 April 2001 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref> that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the [[Palladists|Palladium]], which controlled the organization and had a satanic agenda.

Pike says in Morals and Dogma, \"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it ''he'' who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls?

(2009). Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character. Pp. 40-60 in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing.</ref> In Leland's mythology, Diana pursued her brother Lucifer across the sky as a cat pursues a mouse. According to Leland, after dividing herself into light and darkness:\n:\"...Diana saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire. Wishing to receive the light again into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire. This desire was the Dawn. But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he was the light which files into the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which flies before the cat.\"<ref name=aradia>Charles G. Leland, ''Aradia: The Gospel of Witches'', Theophania Publishing, US, 2010</ref>\n\nHere, the motions of Diana and Lucifer once again mirror the celestial motions of the moon and Venus, respectively.<ref name=stregheria>Magliocco, Sabina.
