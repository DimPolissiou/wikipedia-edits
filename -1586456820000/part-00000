It continues to follow the actions of a secret organization known as the '''Sanctuary''' Network, who track down a series of creatures known as abnormals and then bring them to the Sanctuary base for refuge. [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Robin Dunne]], [[Emilie Ullerup]], [[Ryan Robbins]], [[Agam Darshi]] and [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] are billed in the opening credits as the main cast.\n\nThe season starts six weeks after the conclusion of the [[Sanctuary (season 1)|first season]], where the protagonists work to defeat the antagonistic Cabal from destroying the Sanctuary Network, but in the process [[Ashley Magnus]] (Ullerup), daughter of Sanctuary leader [[Helen Magnus]] (Tapping), dies. Later episodes involve a story arc on Big Bertha, the most dangerous abnormal on Earth.\n\nThe second season included a writing team, where as in the first there were only two writers; series creator [[Damian Kindler]], and [[Sam Egan]]; however Egan left the series after the end of the first season. The producers wanted to expand on the Sanctuary Network by including episodes where the team visit some of their international sites as opposed to only mentioning them. The season was filmed in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia from late March to July 2009, with some scenes of the finale filmed on location in Tokyo, Japan. Anthem Visual Effects continues to produce the series' [[visual effects]]. Anthem found an exponential growth in their work, with some episodes including as many as 500 visual effects shots.\n\nThe first ten episodes were seen by an average of 1.55 million viewers in the United States, increasing to 2.2 million when time-shifted viewings were taken into account. It received generally positive reviews from critics; however, some reviewers criticized the abrupt end to the Cabal arc within the first few episodes. The introduction of the new character [[Kate Freelander]] (Darshi) was also met with mixed reactions, while there was an outpouring of fans against Ashley's demise. Season two won seven [[Leo Awards]] after its release. The season was released on a four-disc set on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on June 9, 2010 in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]], June 15 in Region 1, and October 4 in Region 2.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of Sanctuary episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>\n{{Episode table |background=#9A3300|overall=6 |season=6 |title=22 |director=15 |writer=25 |airdate=15 |viewers=11 |country=US |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Sanctuary (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = [[End of Nights|End of Nights (Part 1)]]\n |DirectedBy = [[Martin Wood (director)|Martin Wood]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Damian Kindler]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|10|9}}\n |Aux4 = 1.85<ref name=premratings>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/10/12/second-season-premiere-of-syfys-sanctuary-scores-double-digit-increases-stargate-universe-viewership-soars-in-second-week/30250 |title=Second Season Premiere of Syfy's ''Sanctuary'' Scores Double-Digit Increases, ''Stargate Universe'' Viewership Soars in Second Week |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |first=Bill |last=Gorman |publisher=TV by the Numbers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014134352/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/10/12/second-season-premiere-of-syfys-sanctuary-scores-double-digit-increases-stargate-universe-viewership-soars-in-second-week/30250 |archivedate=October 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = [[Sanctuary (season 1)#ep13|Six weeks]] after [[Ashley Magnus]] ([[Emilie Ullerup]]) was turned by the Cabal, her mother [[Helen Magnus]] ([[Amanda Tapping]]) and father [[John Druitt]] ([[Christopher Heyerdahl]]) search for her.

During the battle, Bigfoot is finally persuaded by Magnus to take the cure for Lazarus and help his friends. Three of the hybrids are killed by the weapon and another dies when Henry reactivates the base's electromagnetic (EM) shield, causing the hybrid to vaporize when it teleports.

In addition, they noticed a concert hall and took pictures of one of its angles as they deem the architecture suitable for a Tokyo Sanctuary base.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Robin Dunne]], [[Damian Kindler]], [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Martin Wood (director)|Martin Wood]] |title=Will Vision \u2013 Sanctuary Goes to Tokyo |date=2010 |medium=Sanctuary: The Complete Second Season (DVD) Disc 4 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the shoot of the first part of \"End of Nights\", Kindler loaned his car for a car chase sequence. A later scene involved having the car shot at by snipers. To prevent damage to the car, the bullet holes were made from visual effects.<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> In \"Pavor Nocturnus\", the crew had to make the Sanctuary set ruined in a post-apocalyptic state. Set designer Bridget McGuire made the set look \"horrible\" overnight, but then had to clean it up for the last scene. They also \"completely trashed\" the street sets in the studio.<ref name=\"ac_205\"/> \"Next Tuesday\" was considered a [[bottle episode]] as it was largely filmed in one set, a water tank some 14 feet deep and 70 feet long, in a studio.<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> The episode was filmed over five 13-hour days,<ref name=\"ac_208\"/> not including a two-day break midway through,<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> becoming the fastest time filming a ''Sanctuary'' episode.<ref name=\"ac_208\"/> Wood directed the episode from the water rather than dry land.<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> The following episode \"Penance\" was largely filmed at a constructed city set some three and a half blocks in size, which was previously used in the [[superhero film]] ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''.<ref name=\"ac_209\"/>\n\nThe Mumbai slum set in the season finale was constructed on the parking lot of the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Robin Dunne]] |title=Dancing in Mumbai |date=2010 |medium=Sanctuary: The Complete Second Season (DVD) Disc 4 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref> The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated.<ref name=\"ac_212\"/> 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an ''Sanctuary'' episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes.<ref name=\"ac_213\"/> The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.<ref name=\"ac_212\"/>\n\n===Music===\n[[Andrew Lockington]] was appointed the series composer in the season. The producers liked Lockington's contribution to the score as it was more heightened than it was in the first season.<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> Lockington would also capture the emotional temper when it comes to scoring for the emotional scenes.<ref name=\"ac_203\"/> The composer sampled several instruments from around the world to give the score a more ethnic, international feel.<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> Some episodes feature the score taking different styles. For instance \"Fragments\" features a \"cool [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] soundtrack.\"<ref name=\"ac_206\"/> In \"Kali\", the score adopted a more [[Bollywood]]-style theme, particularly during Will's dance sequence.<ref name=\"ac_213\"/> In addition to the score, there were occasional instances where popular music was featured. \"End of Nights\" featured a track from the [[Toronto]]-based [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Down with Webster]].<ref name=\"ac_202\"/>\n\n===Effects===\nAnthem Visual Effects resumed their duties of producing the visual effects for the second season. The company's Lee Wilson noted that their workload for the second season \"increased exponentially\" over the first,<ref name=sanctviseffects/> with some episodes containing as many as 500 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> The produce decided to \"re-jig\" the opening title sequence, which they wanted to do each year.<ref name=\"ac_210\"/> The photograph where Magnus meets [[Albert Einstein]] changed to aviation pilot [[Amelia Earhart]].<ref name=\"ac_203\"/> The producers noticed that the visual effects have been made \"more wonderous than we did the season before,\" as they were able to produce certain actions that they never tried before. The steno in \"Eulogy\" was designed to look adorable, harmless and bunny-like in its infancy, but more menacing when it grows up. In making the Adjuster fly in \"Hero\", both visual and practical effects were used; some of the simpler sequences involved Gauthier hooked up to a velocity rig, but in order to make him fly over the city skyline, a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] avatar was created.<ref name=sanctviseffects/> The design of the coleanthropus in the same episode was based on a mix of insect and dinosaur.<ref name=\"ac_204\"/>\n\nThe second season introduces \"moving zorts,\" an upgraded technique the film crew used to complete the effect where Druitt teleports. The zorts were used specifically to make the sequences where the cast around Heyerdahl freeze until he leaves the screen. The producers wanted to have the camera move during those shots, as they believed it would be \"way cooler to have those zorts on the move.\"<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> One of the more difficult moving zorts included a \"triple zort\" with other characters who could teleport on the same shot in \"End of Nights\". The sequence was difficult for Tapping, as she had to carry a prop weighing approximately 73 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]].<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> A three-dimensional [[holography|hologram]] of Rachel's office was included in \"Fragments\"; it was originally intended to feature the hologram throughout the episode, but because doing so would be costly, the producers decided to have one scene with the hologram, so Henry could use it as a blueprint to make an identical office with boxes.<ref name=\"ac_206\"/> For the finale, Anthem decided to make the macri and Big Bertha look like the same creature, though Bertha would be a considerably larger creature. Some scenes involve the macri interacting with real life objects, including clothing. To make a scene where the macri enters a jacket, Wilson used fishing wire to move a sleeve slightly. Big Bertha's actions meanwhile, were largely made underwater. Anthem found that making underwater effects was difficult because there was a different style of movement.<ref name=\"ac_212\"/> Additionally, Anthem produced a sequence where Wexford launches [[depth charge]]s from his ship. The producers were looking for [[stock footage]] of the dropping depth charges, but they could not find one in high-definition.<ref name=\"ac_213\"/>\n\n[[File:Next Tuesday Sanctuary.jpg|thumb|alt=A screenshot showing two creatures fighting at the tail of a helicopter, which is suspended in cables. Below, a man and a woman witness the battle. The woman readies a flare and is about to throw it at the helicopter.|An air pump placed under the helicopter (see the water jet below the helicopter) allowed it to sway, which was used to mimic the battle between the vampire squid and sea scorpion. In addition, Amanda Tapping (bottom left) was able to throw the flare in her hand, to the helicopter in only one take.<ref name=\"ac_208\"/>]]\nIn addition to visual effects, other forms of physical effects were produced. In \"Hero\", there was a scene where the camera appeared to be shot from inside a water tank. Instead, a water tank was placed between the camera and the actors, where [[Alka-Seltzer]] was placed at the bottom to simulate bubbles. Wood previously used this technique in the first-season episode \"Requiem\" as well as in ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. The Adjuster comic books at the end of the episode were designed by artists who occasionally work for [[DC Comics]].<ref name=\"ac_204\"/> Dunne wore a mullet and a white eye [[contact lens]] in \"Pavor Nocturnus\" for Will's alternate self in a dystopian future.<ref name=\"ac_205\"/> The vampire squid-related effects for \"Next Tuesday\" were made possible by visual aids. For the shots where the squid swims on the water surface, the production crew used a [[radio-controlled boat]] to mimic a [[wake]]. When the squid erupts from the water, they placed a [[beach ball]] underwater and released it to mimic the splash. To make the helicopter sway during the battles between the squid and sea scorpion, an air pump was placed below it. However, doing so added the side effect of strong currents, proving difficult for the cast to swim towards the helicopter.<ref name=\"ac_208\"/>\n\nThe season also includes stunt work. Weeks before filming \"End of Nights\", Heyerdahl practiced sword fighting to be done against the hybrids in the second part.<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> Jonathon Young performed his own stunts for \"Sleepers\", including being run over by a car and falling from a car. Both stunts involved harnesses and other safety measures. Young also participated in a fight scene with the other vampire characters, but he ended up injuring two of the actors. In one instance Young hit Chad Rook in the face, which caused a fang insert to puncture his lip.<ref name=\"ac_210\"/>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast and ratings===\nThe season commenced airing on Syfy from October 9, 2009, and aired nearly every Friday night until the two-part finale \"Kali\" on January 15, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/sanctuary/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z \u2013 Sanctuary of Syfy |accessdate=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref> It aired alongside the first season of ''[[Stargate Universe]]''.<ref name=gateworld/> The season started off with 1.85 million viewers.

Sinnott criticised the season for wrapping up the Cabal story line in the first two episodes, expecting it to continue throughout the season, as well as accusing the writers of throwing out \"a lot of aspects that made the end of the first season so great.\"<ref name=dvdtalk/> However, he felt there were good episodes, naming \"Sleepers\" as his favourite, and also saying he liked \"Hero\".

It continues to follow the actions of a secret organization known as the '''Sanctuary''' Network, who track down a series of creatures known as abnormals and then bring them to the Sanctuary base for refuge. [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Robin Dunne]], [[Emilie Ullerup]], [[Ryan Robbins]], [[Agam Darshi]] and [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] are billed in the opening credits as the main cast.\n\nThe season starts six weeks after the conclusion of the [[Sanctuary (season 1)|first season]], where the protagonists work to defeat the antagonistic Cabal from destroying the Sanctuary Network, but in the process [[Ashley Magnus]] (Ullerup), daughter of Sanctuary leader [[Helen Magnus]] (Tapping), dies. Later episodes involve a story arc on Big Bertha, the most dangerous abnormal on Earth.\n\nThe second season included a writing team, where as in the first there were only two writers; series creator [[Damian Kindler]], and [[Sam Egan]]; however Egan left the series after the end of the first season. The producers wanted to expand on the Sanctuary Network by including episodes where the team visit some of their international sites as opposed to only mentioning them.

In the original draft, Magnus would fall ill, but that later changed to Will before the episode was filmed.<ref name=\"ac_212\"/> Some episodes in the season originally followed a different order. \"Pavor Nocturnus\" was originally going to be the fourth episode, while \"Hero\" would become the tenth. \"Sleepers\" would also be in an earlier slot. However, the order changed, partially due to availability issues with Jonathon Young for \"Sleepers\".<ref name=\"ac_204\"/> The writers were also working on a Bigfoot-centric episode, where he returns to his home.

Adelson directed \"Fragments\"<ref name=\"ac_206\"/> and \"Sleepers\".<ref name=\"ac_210\"/> Amanda Tapping directed \"Veritas\", her first directorial credit since the ''Stargate SG-1'' episode \"[[Resurrection (Stargate SG-1)|Resurrection]]\" in 2004. To direct the scenes featuring Magnus, Tapping rehearsed them to decide how it would be shot, then appointed somebody to handle the cameras.<ref name=\"ac_207\"/> Peter DeLuise directed \"Haunted\".<ref name=\"ac_211\"/> Lee Wilson from Anthem Visual Effects directed a scene in \"Hero\",<ref name=\"ac_204\"/> while Robbins directed a scene from \"Fragments\" when his character recorded Rachel's documentary.<ref name=\"ac_206\"/>\n\n[[File:Shibuya Night (HDR).jpg|thumb|Some scenes of the second season were filmed on location in Tokyo, including the Shibuya crossing (pictured).]]\nLike the first season, much of the second was filmed on [[chroma key|green screen]] sets in a studio in [[Burnaby]], British Columbia,<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> though also like the first season, there are more instances it was shot on practical sets and on location, most of which taking place just outside the studio.<ref name=\"ac_204\"/> The first part of \"End of Nights\" had scenes filmed at a large empty warehouse.<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> At some point, Dunne, Kindler, Tapping and Wood were sent to Tokyo to promote the series for Syfy Asia. The four decided to use the opportunity to film some scenes for the finale there, one of which was filmed in the [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya crossing]]. Filming took place just as a [[monsoon]] season was kicking in. In addition, they noticed a concert hall and took pictures of one of its angles as they deem the architecture suitable for a Tokyo Sanctuary base.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Robin Dunne]], [[Damian Kindler]], [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Martin Wood (director)|Martin Wood]] |title=Will Vision \u2013 Sanctuary Goes to Tokyo |date=2010 |medium=Sanctuary: The Complete Second Season (DVD) Disc 4 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the shoot of the first part of \"End of Nights\", Kindler loaned his car for a car chase sequence. A later scene involved having the car shot at by snipers. To prevent damage to the car, the bullet holes were made from visual effects.<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> In \"Pavor Nocturnus\", the crew had to make the Sanctuary set ruined in a post-apocalyptic state. Set designer Bridget McGuire made the set look \"horrible\" overnight, but then had to clean it up for the last scene. They also \"completely trashed\" the street sets in the studio.<ref name=\"ac_205\"/> \"Next Tuesday\" was considered a [[bottle episode]] as it was largely filmed in one set, a water tank some 14 feet deep and 70 feet long, in a studio.<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> The episode was filmed over five 13-hour days,<ref name=\"ac_208\"/> not including a two-day break midway through,<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> becoming the fastest time filming a ''Sanctuary'' episode.<ref name=\"ac_208\"/> Wood directed the episode from the water rather than dry land.<ref name=\"anatomy\"/> The following episode \"Penance\" was largely filmed at a constructed city set some three and a half blocks in size, which was previously used in the [[superhero film]] ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''.<ref name=\"ac_209\"/>\n\nThe Mumbai slum set in the season finale was constructed on the parking lot of the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Robin Dunne]] |title=Dancing in Mumbai |date=2010 |medium=Sanctuary: The Complete Second Season (DVD) Disc 4 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref> The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated.<ref name=\"ac_212\"/> 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an ''Sanctuary'' episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes.<ref name=\"ac_213\"/> The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.<ref name=\"ac_212\"/>\n\n===Music===\n[[Andrew Lockington]] was appointed the series composer in the season. The producers liked Lockington's contribution to the score as it was more heightened than it was in the first season.<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> Lockington would also capture the emotional temper when it comes to scoring for the emotional scenes.<ref name=\"ac_203\"/> The composer sampled several instruments from around the world to give the score a more ethnic, international feel.<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> Some episodes feature the score taking different styles. For instance \"Fragments\" features a \"cool [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] soundtrack.\"<ref name=\"ac_206\"/> In \"Kali\", the score adopted a more [[Bollywood]]-style theme, particularly during Will's dance sequence.<ref name=\"ac_213\"/> In addition to the score, there were occasional instances where popular music was featured. \"End of Nights\" featured a track from the [[Toronto]]-based [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Down with Webster]].<ref name=\"ac_202\"/>\n\n===Effects===\nAnthem Visual Effects resumed their duties of producing the visual effects for the second season. The company's Lee Wilson noted that their workload for the second season \"increased exponentially\" over the first,<ref name=sanctviseffects/> with some episodes containing as many as 500 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> The produce decided to \"re-jig\" the opening title sequence, which they wanted to do each year.<ref name=\"ac_210\"/> The photograph where Magnus meets [[Albert Einstein]] changed to aviation pilot [[Amelia Earhart]].<ref name=\"ac_203\"/> The producers noticed that the visual effects have been made \"more wonderous than we did the season before,\" as they were able to produce certain actions that they never tried before. The steno in \"Eulogy\" was designed to look adorable, harmless and bunny-like in its infancy, but more menacing when it grows up. In making the Adjuster fly in \"Hero\", both visual and practical effects were used; some of the simpler sequences involved Gauthier hooked up to a velocity rig, but in order to make him fly over the city skyline, a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] avatar was created.<ref name=sanctviseffects/> The design of the coleanthropus in the same episode was based on a mix of insect and dinosaur.<ref name=\"ac_204\"/>\n\nThe second season introduces \"moving zorts,\" an upgraded technique the film crew used to complete the effect where Druitt teleports. The zorts were used specifically to make the sequences where the cast around Heyerdahl freeze until he leaves the screen. The producers wanted to have the camera move during those shots, as they believed it would be \"way cooler to have those zorts on the move.\"<ref name=\"ac_201\"/> One of the more difficult moving zorts included a \"triple zort\" with other characters who could teleport on the same shot in \"End of Nights\". The sequence was difficult for Tapping, as she had to carry a prop weighing approximately 73 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]].<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> A three-dimensional [[holography|hologram]] of Rachel's office was included in \"Fragments\"; it was originally intended to feature the hologram throughout the episode, but because doing so would be costly, the producers decided to have one scene with the hologram, so Henry could use it as a blueprint to make an identical office with boxes.<ref name=\"ac_206\"/> For the finale, Anthem decided to make the macri and Big Bertha look like the same creature, though Bertha would be a considerably larger creature. Some scenes involve the macri interacting with real life objects, including clothing. To make a scene where the macri enters a jacket, Wilson used fishing wire to move a sleeve slightly. Big Bertha's actions meanwhile, were largely made underwater. Anthem found that making underwater effects was difficult because there was a different style of movement.<ref name=\"ac_212\"/> Additionally, Anthem produced a sequence where Wexford launches [[depth charge]]s from his ship. The producers were looking for [[stock footage]] of the dropping depth charges, but they could not find one in high-definition.<ref name=\"ac_213\"/>\n\n[[File:Next Tuesday Sanctuary.jpg|thumb|alt=A screenshot showing two creatures fighting at the tail of a helicopter, which is suspended in cables. Below, a man and a woman witness the battle. The woman readies a flare and is about to throw it at the helicopter.|An air pump placed under the helicopter (see the water jet below the helicopter) allowed it to sway, which was used to mimic the battle between the vampire squid and sea scorpion. In addition, Amanda Tapping (bottom left) was able to throw the flare in her hand, to the helicopter in only one take.<ref name=\"ac_208\"/>]]\nIn addition to visual effects, other forms of physical effects were produced. In \"Hero\", there was a scene where the camera appeared to be shot from inside a water tank. Instead, a water tank was placed between the camera and the actors, where [[Alka-Seltzer]] was placed at the bottom to simulate bubbles. Wood previously used this technique in the first-season episode \"Requiem\" as well as in ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. The Adjuster comic books at the end of the episode were designed by artists who occasionally work for [[DC Comics]].<ref name=\"ac_204\"/> Dunne wore a mullet and a white eye [[contact lens]] in \"Pavor Nocturnus\" for Will's alternate self in a dystopian future.<ref name=\"ac_205\"/> The vampire squid-related effects for \"Next Tuesday\" were made possible by visual aids. For the shots where the squid swims on the water surface, the production crew used a [[radio-controlled boat]] to mimic a [[wake]]. When the squid erupts from the water, they placed a [[beach ball]] underwater and released it to mimic the splash. To make the helicopter sway during the battles between the squid and sea scorpion, an air pump was placed below it. However, doing so added the side effect of strong currents, proving difficult for the cast to swim towards the helicopter.<ref name=\"ac_208\"/>\n\nThe season also includes stunt work. Weeks before filming \"End of Nights\", Heyerdahl practiced sword fighting to be done against the hybrids in the second part.<ref name=\"ac_202\"/> Jonathon Young performed his own stunts for \"Sleepers\", including being run over by a car and falling from a car. Both stunts involved harnesses and other safety measures. Young also participated in a fight scene with the other vampire characters, but he ended up injuring two of the actors. In one instance Young hit Chad Rook in the face, which caused a fang insert to puncture his lip.<ref name=\"ac_210\"/>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\n===Broadcast and ratings===\nThe season commenced airing on Syfy from October 9, 2009, and aired nearly every Friday night until the two-part finale \"Kali\" on January 15, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/sanctuary/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z \u2013 Sanctuary of Syfy |accessdate=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref> It aired alongside the first season of ''[[Stargate Universe]]''.<ref name=gateworld/> The season started off with 1.85 million viewers.

Harcourt wondered what a [[Reality competition|reality show]] would look like if the people never met face-to-face. He had also been considering the idea of a [[bird's-eye view]]-style documentary of an apartment building, seeing into each of their lives. He began to work on ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people.

The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person.

He began to work on ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nToberlyan is bounded on the north by [[Corran, County Cavan|Corran]] townland, on the west by [[Derrycassan]] townland, on the south by [[Coologe]] townland and on the east by [[Toberlyan Duffin]] townland. Its chief geographical features are [[Coologe]] Lough, a stream and a stone quarry. Toberlyan is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes.

The said Cormacke McGawran was the son of a previous chief of the clan, [[Tomas \u00d3g M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]] who was elected in 1584. The lands are not shown on either the Plantation map of 1609 or the Down survey map of 1658 but would have been sub-divisions of [[Coologe]] townland at the time.

His Estate was large and he named eight beneficiaries, including Martha (Faris) Hinds, Ralph Hinds, Walter Hinds, John Hinds, William Hinds, Thomas Hinds, Anne Hinds and Mary (Hinds) Clarke. He left Toberlyan to his son Ralph as follows- ''To Ralph Hinds, his eldest son, the lands of Toberlion, Meelick and Duffin and the responsibility to pay his (Ralph's) brother John an annual income of \u00a340. Also to Ralph, and to his heirs forever, the lands of Nedd and Carnagee, and \u00a31000 to be paid out of his father's effects together with two score of the best bullocks on the lands which he is to enjoy after his father's decease''.<ref>[http://www.heatonbrown.com/p155.htm#i4132]</ref> The will of Ralph Hinds dated 15 April 1794 and proved on 10 May 1794 included, inter alia, ''Toberlion, Meelick and Duffin in the County of Cavan''.\n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Tobberlyan''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn the 1825 Registry of Freeholders for County Cavan there was one freeholder registered in ''Tobberlyan''- John Dunn.

The ROCAF's primary mission is the defense of the airspace over and around [[Taiwan]]. Priorities of the ROCAF include the development of long range reconnaissance and surveillance networks, integrating [[C4ISTAR]] systems to increase battle effectiveness, procuring counterstrike weapons, next generation fighters, and hardening airfields and other facilities to survive a surprise attack.\n\nIn May 2005, the Ministry of National Defense indicated its intention to transfer command of all defensive missile systems to the ROCAF, while future offensive missiles would be placed under a newly formed missile command. As of 2006, all medium and long range SAM units were transferred from ROC Army's Missile Command to ROCAF, while ROCAF's airbase security units were transferred to ROC Army Military Police. However, it was revealed that in January 2011, five years of problems of integrating those long range ex-ROC Army SAM units into ROCAF has forced ROCAF high command to return those units back to ROC Army's Missile Command. Missile Command is now directly under Defense Ministry's GHQ control.\n\nIn July 2010, former United States Air Force deputy under secretary for international affairs, Bruce Lemkin, said that Taiwan's ability to defend its airspace had degraded due to its ageing fighters and that the sale of new fighter aircraft to Taiwan was an urgent priority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|title=INTERVIEW - Taiwan overdue for F-16 jets, ex U.S. official say|author=Reuters Editorial|date=5 July 2010|work=Reuters India|accessdate=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204145337/http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|archive-date=4 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the ROC Air Force has trouble getting fighter planes from abroad due to mainland China's attempts to suppress fighter sales from any country.

In this [[Warlord era|period]], various airplanes were purchased and deployed by warlords in their struggle for power until nominal [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese reunification]] in 1928. In February 1932, US Reserve Lt. [[Robert McCawley Short]], who was transporting armed Chinese aircraft, shot down an IJN aircraft on February 19, 1932, and downed another on February 22 before he was killed (he was posthumously raised to the rank of colonel in the Chinese Air Service).\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), the ROCAF participated in attacks on Japanese warships on the eastern front and along the Yangtze river including support for the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937. The Chinese frontline fighter aircraft initially were mainly the Curtiss Hawk II and III and the [[Boeing P-26]] model 281, and engaged Japanese fighters in many major air battles beginning on August 14, 1937, when Imperial Japanese Navy warplanes raided [[Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport|Chienchiao airbase]]; \"814\" has thus become known as \"Air Force Day\". Chinese Boeing P-26/281 fighters engaged Japanese Mitsubishi A5M fighters in what is among the world's first aerial dogfighting between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft. A unique mission in May 1938 saw two Chinese [[Martin B-10|B-10]] bombers fly a mission over Japan, but dropping only propaganda leaflets over the Japanese cities of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Saga Prefecture|Saga]], four years before 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]] on Japanese home islands. It was a war of attrition for the Chinese pilots, as many of their most experienced ace fighter pilots, such as Lieutenant [[Liu Tsui-Kang]] and Colonel [[Kao Chih-Hang]] were lost early in the war. Code breaking operations played a role in the conflict. A Japanese radio intercept unit was attached to the landing forces at Shanghai. IJN Lt. Commander Tsunezo Wachi and a Lt. Yamada, an expert in Chinese codes, enabled Japanese to make preemptive strikes against ROCAF airfields.<ref>{{cite book|last1=RADM.

From 1946 to 1948, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROCAF participated in combat against the [[People's Liberation Army]] engaging in air-to-air combat on at least eleven occasions in the areas surrounding the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The ROCAF reportedly enjoyed a 31:1 kill ratio against the PLA. GHQ was evacuated to Taiwan along with the rest of the ROC Government in April 1949 following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|title=Taiwan in Time: The great retreat - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730170752/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|archive-date=2018-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref> The ROCAF assisted in halting the PLA advance at the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] on [[Kinmen]] the same year.\n\nThe ROCAF regularly patrolled the Taiwan Straits and fought many engagements with its Communist counterpart (the [[PLAAF]]). The ROCAF received second hand equipment from the US at that time, such as the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]], [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] and [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104]].\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the ROCAF was involved in combat air patrols over the Taiwan Strait and engaged the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLAAF]] and PLAN-AF on several occasions. The ROCAF was also the testbed of American technology at this time. The first successful kill scored by an air-to-air missile was accomplished by a ROCAF F-86 Sabre with then experimental [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. ROCAF pilots also flew [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] recon overflights of the PRC during this time with assistance from the USAF. Known as the [[Black Cat Squadron]] they flew a total of 220 missions, with 102 missions over mainland China, losing 5 aircraft. All five were shot down by [[SA-2|SA-2 surface-to-air missiles]], the same type of surface-to-air missile that shot down [[Gary Powers]] over the USSR in 1960. The 34th \"[[Black Bat Squadron]]\" flew low level missions into China as part of its mapping PRC growing air defense networks, conducting ESM and ECM missions, inserting agents behind enemy lines, and air drop resupply missions.\n[[File:C-123B in flight over US 1950s.jpg|thumb|C-123Bs in flight over US 1950s, Aircraft 641 was later transferred to Taiwan to support CIA operations]]\nStarting in November 1967, the ROC secretly operated a cargo transport detachment to assist the US and the ROV as part of [[Republic of China in the Vietnam War|its participation in the Vietnam War]]. It was based on existing formation of the 34th squadron of ROC Air force.

The ROCAF's primary mission is the defense of the airspace over and around [[Taiwan]]. Priorities of the ROCAF include the development of long range reconnaissance and surveillance networks, integrating [[C4ISTAR]] systems to increase battle effectiveness, procuring counterstrike weapons, next generation fighters, and hardening airfields and other facilities to survive a surprise attack.\n\nIn May 2005, the Ministry of National Defense indicated its intention to transfer command of all defensive missile systems to the ROCAF, while future offensive missiles would be placed under a newly formed missile command. As of 2006, all medium and long range SAM units were transferred from ROC Army's Missile Command to ROCAF, while ROCAF's airbase security units were transferred to ROC Army Military Police. However, it was revealed that in January 2011, five years of problems of integrating those long range ex-ROC Army SAM units into ROCAF has forced ROCAF high command to return those units back to ROC Army's Missile Command. Missile Command is now directly under Defense Ministry's GHQ control.\n\nIn July 2010, former United States Air Force deputy under secretary for international affairs, Bruce Lemkin, said that Taiwan's ability to defend its airspace had degraded due to its ageing fighters and that the sale of new fighter aircraft to Taiwan was an urgent priority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|title=INTERVIEW - Taiwan overdue for F-16 jets, ex U.S. official say|author=Reuters Editorial|date=5 July 2010|work=Reuters India|accessdate=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204145337/http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49901320100705|archive-date=4 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the ROC Air Force has trouble getting fighter planes from abroad due to mainland China's attempts to suppress fighter sales from any country.

In this [[Warlord era|period]], various airplanes were purchased and deployed by warlords in their struggle for power until nominal [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese reunification]] in 1928. In February 1932, US Reserve Lt. [[Robert McCawley Short]], who was transporting armed Chinese aircraft, shot down an IJN aircraft on February 19, 1932, and downed another on February 22 before he was killed (he was posthumously raised to the rank of colonel in the Chinese Air Service).\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), the ROCAF participated in attacks on Japanese warships on the eastern front and along the Yangtze river including support for the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937. The Chinese frontline fighter aircraft initially were mainly the Curtiss Hawk II and III and the [[Boeing P-26]] model 281, and engaged Japanese fighters in many major air battles beginning on August 14, 1937, when Imperial Japanese Navy warplanes raided [[Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport|Chienchiao airbase]]; \"814\" has thus become known as \"Air Force Day\". Chinese Boeing P-26/281 fighters engaged Japanese Mitsubishi A5M fighters in what is among the world's first aerial dogfighting between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft. A unique mission in May 1938 saw two Chinese [[Martin B-10|B-10]] bombers fly a mission over Japan, but dropping only propaganda leaflets over the Japanese cities of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Saga Prefecture|Saga]], four years before 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]] on Japanese home islands. It was a war of attrition for the Chinese pilots, as many of their most experienced ace fighter pilots, such as Lieutenant [[Liu Tsui-Kang]] and Colonel [[Kao Chih-Hang]] were lost early in the war. Code breaking operations played a role in the conflict. A Japanese radio intercept unit was attached to the landing forces at Shanghai. IJN Lt. Commander Tsunezo Wachi and a Lt. Yamada, an expert in Chinese codes, enabled Japanese to make preemptive strikes against ROCAF airfields.<ref>{{cite book|last1=RADM.

From 1946 to 1948, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROCAF participated in combat against the [[People's Liberation Army]] engaging in air-to-air combat on at least eleven occasions in the areas surrounding the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The ROCAF reportedly enjoyed a 31:1 kill ratio against the PLA. GHQ was evacuated to Taiwan along with the rest of the ROC Government in April 1949 following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|title=Taiwan in Time: The great retreat - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2018-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730170752/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/12/04/2003660529/1|archive-date=2018-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref> The ROCAF assisted in halting the PLA advance at the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] on [[Kinmen]] the same year.\n\nThe ROCAF regularly patrolled the Taiwan Straits and fought many engagements with its Communist counterpart (the [[PLAAF]]). The ROCAF received second hand equipment from the US at that time, such as the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]], [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] and [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104]].\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the ROCAF was involved in combat air patrols over the Taiwan Strait and engaged the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLAAF]] and PLAN-AF on several occasions. The ROCAF was also the testbed of American technology at this time. The first successful kill scored by an air-to-air missile was accomplished by a ROCAF F-86 Sabre with then experimental [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]. ROCAF pilots also flew [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] recon overflights of the PRC during this time with assistance from the USAF. Known as the [[Black Cat Squadron]] they flew a total of 220 missions, with 102 missions over mainland China, losing 5 aircraft. All five were shot down by [[SA-2|SA-2 surface-to-air missiles]], the same type of surface-to-air missile that shot down [[Gary Powers]] over the USSR in 1960. The 34th \"[[Black Bat Squadron]]\" flew low level missions into China as part of its mapping PRC growing air defense networks, conducting ESM and ECM missions, inserting agents behind enemy lines, and air drop resupply missions.\n[[File:C-123B in flight over US 1950s.jpg|thumb|C-123Bs in flight over US 1950s, Aircraft 641 was later transferred to Taiwan to support CIA operations]]\nStarting in November 1967, the ROC secretly operated a cargo transport detachment to assist the US and the ROV as part of [[Republic of China in the Vietnam War|its participation in the Vietnam War]]. It was based on existing formation of the 34th squadron of ROC Air force. The unit's strength included two [[C-123]] cargo aircraft, seven flight officers and two mechanics, even though a higher number of military personnel was involved through rotation.

Sun fled to [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord [[Chen Jiongming]] restored him in October 1920 during the [[Yuegui Wars]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} On 16 June 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship [[SS Zhongshan|Yongfeng]] after Chen sided with the [[Zhili Clique]]'s [[Beiyang government|Beijing government]]. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|a government]] in the city for the third time.\n\n[[File:Naval Jack of the Republic of China.svg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Flag of [[Kuomintang]]]]\nFrom 1923 to 1926 Sun and the Kuomintang [[Army and Navy Marshal stronghold of the Republic of China|used the city as a base]] to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north.  Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\n\nIn 1924 the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The [[First United Front|Kuomintang-CCP cooperation]] was confirmed in the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|First Congress of the KMT]] and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the [[Peasant Movement Training Institute]] in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used [[USSR|Soviet]] funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the [[Whampoa Military Academy]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} In August, the fledgling army suppressed the [[Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising]]. The next year the anti-imperialist [[May Thirtieth Movement]] swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the [[Shakee Massacre]].\n\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader [[Liao Zhongkai]] was assassinated and the right-wing leader [[Hu Hanmin]], the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist [[Wang Jingwei]] in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing [[Western Hills Group]] vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The \"[[Canton Coup]]\" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the [[KMT|Nationalists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|their army]] against [[Wang Jingwei]], the party's left wing, its [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] allies, and its [[USSR|Soviet]] advisors.<ref>{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925\u20131945 |series=Studies in the Modern History of Asia |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-14571-8 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&pg=PA101 101 ff] |access-date=2017-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225071802/https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |archive-date=2017-02-25 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=AhXiang1998>{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998}}</ref> By May, he had ended civilian control of the military<ref name=AhXiang1998/> and begun his [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] against the [[Warlord Era|warlords]] of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the [[Shanghai Massacre]]. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of [[Li Jishen]], resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when [[Zhang Fakui]], a general supportive of the Wuhan faction seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the [[Guangzhou Uprising]]. Prominent communist military leaders [[Ye Ting]] and [[Ye Jianying]] led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to [[Li Jishen]].\n\nLi was deposed in the War between Chiang and Guangxi Clique. By 1929, [[Chen Jitang]] had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou.<ref>\u674e\u6d01\u4e4b\uff0c\u9648\u6d4e\u68e0\u4e3b\u7ca4\u59cb\u672b\uff0c\u300a\u5e7f\u5dde\u6587\u53f2\u300b\u7b2c\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u8f91\u3002</ref> Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Sun Fo]] and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amidst the armed stand-off led to the [[4th National Congress of Kuomintang]] being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936.\n\nDuring [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II]], the \"[[Canton Operation]]\" subjected the city to [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation by the end of December 1938.\n\n==== People's Republic of China ====\nAmid the closing months of the [[Chinese Civil War]], Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] after the taking of [[Nanjing]] by the PLA in April 1949. The [[People's Liberation Army]] entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Colonial Macau|Macau]], the [[KMT|Nationalists]] blew up the [[Haizhu Bridge]] across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\n\nThe [[China|People's Republic of China]] initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's [[Tanka people|boat people]] to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]] and its ties to [[overseas Chinese]] have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's [[opening up policy|opening up]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialisation and development.\n\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with [[Huadu District|Huadu]] and [[Panyu District|Panyu]] joining the city as [[district (China)|urban districts]] and [[Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng]] as more rural [[county (China)|counties]]. The former districts of [[Dongshan District, Guangzhou|Dongshan]] and [[Fangcun District|Fangcun]] were abolished in 2005, merged into [[Yuexiu District|Yuexiu]] and [[Liwan District|Liwan]] respectively. The city acquired [[Nansha District|Nansha]] and [[Luogang District|Luogang]]. The former was carved out of [[Panyu District|Panyu]], the latter from parts of [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun]], [[Tianhe District|Tianhe]], [[Zengcheng]], and an exclave within [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]]. The [[National People's Congress]] approved a development plan for the [[Pearl River Delta]] in January 2009; on March 19 the same year, the Guangzhou and [[Foshan]] municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |title=Guangzhou and Foshan signed \"City Merge Cooperation Framework\" |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |access-date=2010-05-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705135320/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-03/19/content_11037051.htm |archive-date=2009-07-05 }}</ref> In 2014, [[Luogang District|Luogang]] merged into [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]] and both [[Conghua District|Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng District|Zengcheng]] counties were upgraded to districts.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Nieuhof-Ambassade-vers-la-Chine-1665 0744-2.tif|[[Johan Nieuhof|Nieuhof]]'s imaginative 1665 map of \"Kanton\",<ref>{{citation|last=La Carpentier|first=Jean-Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Le Carpentier|title=L'Ambassade de la Compagnie Orientale des Provinces Unies vers l'Empereur de la Chine ''[''Embassy of the United Provinces' East India Company to the Emperor of China'']''|date=1655|language=fr}}</ref> made from second-hand accounts while Europeans were still forbidden from entering the walled city\nFile:Canton factories.jpg|The [[Thirteen Factories]] {{c.|1805|lk=no}}, displaying the flags of [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]], the United States, Sweden, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and the [[Prince's Flag|Netherlands]]\nFile:Shop of Tingqua, the painter.jpg|An 1855 painting of the gallery of Tingqua, one of the most successful suppliers of \"export paintings\" for Guangzhou's foreign traders.<br />Common themes included the [[Thirteen Factories]], the [[Whampoa Anchorage]] (now Pazhou), and the [[Sea-Banner Temple]] (now Hoi Tong Monastery)\nFile:Canton1860.jpg|[[Daniel Vrooman|Vrooman]]'s 1860 map of the \"City and Entire Suburbs of Canton\", one of the first made after the treaties of [[Treaty of Tianjin|Tianjin]] and [[Convention of Peking|Beijing]] permitted foreigners full access to Guangzhou's walled city\nFile:Flowery Pagoda.jpg|The [[Flowery Pagoda]] at the [[Temple of the Six Banyan Trees]] in 1863\nFile:Lai Afong, Five Stories Pagoda Guangzhou, c1880.JPG|The [[Five-storey Pagoda]] atop [[Yuexiu Hill]] {{c.|1880|lk=no}}\nFile:Lai Afong, Sacred Heart Cathedral Guangzhou, c1880.JPG|The [[Guangzhou's Sacred Heart Cathedral|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] towering over the one- and two-storey homes of old Guangzhou {{c.|1880|lk=no}}\nFile:Canton street scene, 1919.jpg|Street scene in Guangzhou, 1919\nFile:Canton1920 d006 map of of the city.jpg|The [[US Navy]]'s Dept of Navigation's 1920 map of \"Canton\"<ref>{{citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/cantonchina00unitrich#page/4/mode/2up|title=US Navy Ports of the World: Canton|publisher=US Bureau of Navigation|series=Ditty Box Guide Book Series|at=[https://archive.org/stream/cantonchina00unitrich#page/n5/mode/2up Canton]}}</ref>\nFile:Whampoa3.jpg|[[Sun Yat-sen]] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] at the opening of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] on 16 June 1924\nFile:The Bund Canton.jpg|The Guangzhou Bund in 1930, with rows of [[Tanka people|Tanka]] boats.\nFile:1937 Canton, China VP8.webm|A short film of Guangzhou in 1937\nFile:PLA Troops entered to Guangzhou.jpg|The [[People's Liberation Army]] entering Guangzhou on 14 October 1949\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nf49-4.jpg|thumb|Map of Guangzhou (labeled as KUANG-CHOU (CANTON) {{lang|zh-hant|\u5ee3\u5dde}}) in surrounding region ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1954)]]\n[[File:Tiantang Peak.jpg|thumb|[[Tiantang Peak]], highest mountain in Guangzhou]]\nThe old town of Guangzhou was near [[Baiyun Mountain (Guangdong)|Baiyun Mountain]] on the east bank of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] (Zhujiang) about {{convert|80|mi|0}} from its junction with the [[South China Sea]] and about {{convert|300|mi|0}} below its [[head of navigation]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=37}} It commanded the rich alluvial plain of the [[Pearl River Delta]], with its connection to the sea protected at the [[Humen Strait]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=37}} The present city spans {{convert|7434.4|sqkm|1}} on both sides of the river from {{nowrap|112\u00b0 57\u2032}} to {{nowrap|114\u00b0 03\u2032 E}} longitude and {{nowrap|22\u00b0 26\u2032}} to {{nowrap|23\u00b0 56\u2032 N}} latitude in south-central Guangdong.

Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is [[Cantonese]]. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]]. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programmes on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based [[China National Radio]] also broadcasts Mandarin programmes in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programme, ''Guangdong Today'', which is broadcast globally through the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]]. Daily English news programmes are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.\n\nGuangzhou has some of the best Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in [[mainland China]], most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the [[Guangzhou Daily]] Press Group, [[Southern Daily|Nanfang Press Corporation]], and the [[Yangcheng Evening News]] Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are ''[[Guangzhou Daily]]'' and ''[[Southern Metropolis Daily]]''. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while ''Southern Metropolis Daily'' is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is ''That's Guangzhou'', which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into ''[[That's PRD]]'', producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces ''In the Red''.\n\n{{anchor|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre}}\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:North Square of SYSU.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Sun Yat-sen University]] main gate]]\n[[File:\u4e2d\u5c71\u5927\u5b78\u4e2d\u5c71\u91ab\u5b78\u9662\u6b63\u95802006.JPG|thumb|upright=.9|The College of Medical Science at Sun Yat-sen University]]\n[[File:Guangzhou Library 2013.11.15 18-30-36.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Guangzhou Library]]\nThe [[Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre]], also known as Guangzhou University Town ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e7f\u5dde|\u5927\u5b66|\u57ce}}}}), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou.

The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister [[Duan Qirui]]'s abrogation of the constitution triggered the [[Constitutional Protection Movement]]. [[Sun Yat-sen]] came to head the [[Constitutional Protection Junta|Guangzhou Military Government]] supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord [[Chen Jiongming]] restored him in October 1920 during the [[Yuegui Wars]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} On 16 June 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship [[SS Zhongshan|Yongfeng]] after Chen sided with the [[Zhili Clique]]'s [[Beiyang government|Beijing government]]. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|a government]] in the city for the third time.\n\n[[File:Naval Jack of the Republic of China.svg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Flag of [[Kuomintang]]]]\nFrom 1923 to 1926 Sun and the Kuomintang [[Army and Navy Marshal stronghold of the Republic of China|used the city as a base]] to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north.  Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\n\nIn 1924 the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The [[First United Front|Kuomintang-CCP cooperation]] was confirmed in the [[1st National Congress of Kuomintang|First Congress of the KMT]] and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the [[Peasant Movement Training Institute]] in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used [[USSR|Soviet]] funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the [[Whampoa Military Academy]].{{sfnp|Beck|2007}} In August, the fledgling army suppressed the [[Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising]]. The next year the anti-imperialist [[May Thirtieth Movement]] swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the [[Shakee Massacre]].\n\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader [[Liao Zhongkai]] was assassinated and the right-wing leader [[Hu Hanmin]], the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist [[Wang Jingwei]] in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing [[Western Hills Group]] vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The \"[[Canton Coup]]\" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the [[KMT|Nationalists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|their army]] against [[Wang Jingwei]], the party's left wing, its [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] allies, and its [[USSR|Soviet]] advisors.<ref>{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925\u20131945 |series=Studies in the Modern History of Asia |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-14571-8 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&pg=PA101 101 ff] |access-date=2017-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225071802/https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |archive-date=2017-02-25 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=AhXiang1998>{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998}}</ref> By May, he had ended civilian control of the military<ref name=AhXiang1998/> and begun his [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] against the [[Warlord Era|warlords]] of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the [[Shanghai Massacre]]. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of [[Li Jishen]], resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when [[Zhang Fakui]], a general supportive of the Wuhan faction seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the [[Guangzhou Uprising]]. Prominent communist military leaders [[Ye Ting]] and [[Ye Jianying]] led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to [[Li Jishen]].\n\nLi was deposed in the War between Chiang and Guangxi Clique. By 1929, [[Chen Jitang]] had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou.<ref>\u674e\u6d01\u4e4b\uff0c\u9648\u6d4e\u68e0\u4e3b\u7ca4\u59cb\u672b\uff0c\u300a\u5e7f\u5dde\u6587\u53f2\u300b\u7b2c\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u8f91\u3002</ref> Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Sun Fo]] and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amidst the armed stand-off led to the [[4th National Congress of Kuomintang]] being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936.\n\nDuring [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II]], the \"[[Canton Operation]]\" subjected the city to [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] occupation by the end of December 1938.\n\n==== People's Republic of China ====\nAmid the closing months of the [[Chinese Civil War]], Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] after the taking of [[Nanjing]] by the PLA in April 1949. The [[People's Liberation Army]] entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Colonial Macau|Macau]], the [[KMT|Nationalists]] blew up the [[Haizhu Bridge]] across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\n\nThe [[China|People's Republic of China]] initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's [[Tanka people|boat people]] to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]] and its ties to [[overseas Chinese]] have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's [[opening up policy|opening up]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialisation and development.\n\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with [[Huadu District|Huadu]] and [[Panyu District|Panyu]] joining the city as [[district (China)|urban districts]] and [[Conghua]] and [[Zengcheng]] as more rural [[county (China)|counties]]. The former districts of [[Dongshan District, Guangzhou|Dongshan]] and [[Fangcun District|Fangcun]] were abolished in 2005, merged into [[Yuexiu District|Yuexiu]] and [[Liwan District|Liwan]] respectively. The city acquired [[Nansha District|Nansha]] and [[Luogang District|Luogang]]. The former was carved out of [[Panyu District|Panyu]], the latter from parts of [[Baiyun District, Guangzhou|Baiyun]], [[Tianhe District|Tianhe]], [[Zengcheng]], and an exclave within [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Huangpu]].

The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while ''Southern Metropolis Daily'' is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is ''That's Guangzhou'', which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into ''[[That's PRD]]'', producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces ''In the Red''.\n\n{{anchor|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre}}\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:North Square of SYSU.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Sun Yat-sen University]] main gate]]\n[[File:\u4e2d\u5c71\u5927\u5b78\u4e2d\u5c71\u91ab\u5b78\u9662\u6b63\u95802006.JPG|thumb|upright=.9|The College of Medical Science at Sun Yat-sen University]]\n[[File:Guangzhou Library 2013.11.15 18-30-36.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Guangzhou Library]]\nThe [[Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center|Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre]], also known as Guangzhou University Town ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e7f\u5dde|\u5927\u5b66|\u57ce}}}}), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou.
