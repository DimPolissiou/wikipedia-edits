Centered around guitarist/lead vocalist [[Doug Martsch]], the only permanent member, Built to Spill has released eight full-length albums since its incarnation. \n\n==History==\nFormer [[Treepeople]] guitarist/vocalist [[Doug Martsch]] formed Built to Spill in 1992 with [[Brett Netson]] and [[Ralf Youtz]] as the band's original members. In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member.  After the band's first album, ''[[Ultimate Alternative Wavers]]'', was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by [[Brett Nelson]] and Andy Capps for 1994's ''[[There's Nothing Wrong with Love]]''.  A [[compilation album]] called ''[[The Normal Years]]'' followed, which included recordings by both lineups. ''[[Built to Spill Caustic Resin]]'', an EP that features Martsch with the members of [[Caustic Resin]], was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song \"Still Flat\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nMartsch signed Built to Spill to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with ''[[Perfect from Now On]]''. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. ''Perfect from Now On'' was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released ''[[Keep It Like a Secret]]'' to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success. ''[[Built to Spill Live|Live]]'' was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Ancient Melodies of the Future]]'', was released in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Martsch released ''[[Now You Know (Doug Martsch album)|Now You Know]]'', a solo album with both [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] elements.

Centered around guitarist/lead vocalist [[Doug Martsch]], the only permanent member, Built to Spill has has released eight full-length albums since its incarnation. \n\n==History==\nFormer [[Treepeople]] guitarist/vocalist [[Doug Martsch]] formed Built to Spill in 1992 with [[Brett Netson]] and [[Ralf Youtz]] as the band's original members. In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member.  After the band's first album, ''[[Ultimate Alternative Wavers]]'', was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by [[Brett Nelson]] and Andy Capps for 1994's ''[[There's Nothing Wrong with Love]]''.  A [[compilation album]] called ''[[The Normal Years]]'' followed, which included recordings by both lineups. ''[[Built to Spill Caustic Resin]]'', an EP that features Martsch with the members of [[Caustic Resin]], was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song \"Still Flat\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nMartsch signed Built to Spill to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with ''[[Perfect from Now On]]''. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. ''Perfect from Now On'' was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released ''[[Keep It Like a Secret]]'' to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success. ''[[Built to Spill Live|Live]]'' was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Ancient Melodies of the Future]]'', was released in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Martsch released ''[[Now You Know (Doug Martsch album)|Now You Know]]'', a solo album with both [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] elements.  He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.\n[[Image:Built2spill.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doug Martsch]] performing with the band at [[Primavera Sound Festival]].]]\nWarner Bros.

Today TFN is an inter-island [[airline hub|hub]] connecting all seven of the main [[Canary Islands]] with connections to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Europe]].\n\nOn 27 March 1977, Los Rodeos Airport was the site of the [[Tenerife airport disaster|worst accident in aviation history]], when two [[Boeing 747]]s collided on the runway in heavy fog causing the deaths of 583 passengers and crew.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nMany years before the airport had even been built, the field at Los Rodeos was hastily prepared to accommodate the first (though unofficial) flight into Tenerife operated by an [[Arado V I]] (D-1594) aircraft operating from [[Berlin]] on behalf of [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]].\n\nIn May 1930, the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Subvencionadas S.A. (C.L.A.S.S.A.) established the first air link between the Spanish mainland and the Canary Islands using a [[Ford Trimotor|Ford 4-AT Trimotor]] (M-CKKA), which took off from [[Getafe, Madrid]] to the Los Rodeos field via [[Casablanca]], [[Cape Juby]] and Gando in [[Gran Canaria]].\n\nAfter the final location of the airport had been decided, funds were gathered between 1935 and 1939 to build a small hangar and begin expanding the airstrip which would become Los Rodeos. In July 1936 [[Francisco Franco]] did not fly from here after taking over the island to invade the mainland Spain. He flew from Gando (Gran Canaria), in a DH-89 Dragon Rapide chartered to the British company Olley Air Service.\n\nOperations into Los Rodeos recommenced on 23 January 1941 with a [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide|De Havilland DH89A Dragon Rapide]] operating an [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]] flight from Gando in Gran Canaria. By 1946, more hangars, a passenger terminal and an {{convert|800|m|abbr=on|0}} paved runway had been built, and the airport was officially opened to all national and international traffic. The runway was stretched at various times during the 1940s and 1950s, reaching a length of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on|0}} in 1953, by which time the airport was also equipped with runway edge lighting and an air-ground radio, enabling night operations.\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\nBy 1964, runway 12/30 had been stretched to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on|0}} to accommodate the [[DC-8]], new [[Avionics|navigation aids]] were installed, and the apron was expanded to provide more parking spaces for aircraft. In 1971, with the prospect of the [[Boeing 747]] flying into the airport, the runway was reinforced and an [[Instrument Landing System|ILS (Instrument Landing System)]] was installed.\n\nA new airport, [[Tenerife South Airport]], was inaugurated on 6 November 1978, in response to the 1977 [[Tenerife airport disaster]] which resulted in the highest number of fatalities (excluding ground fatalities) of any single accident in aviation history. The south airport is situated at sea level to avert the occurrence of fog, one of the reasons for the crash.\n\nA new terminal was opened at Tenerife North Airport in 2002, comprising car park, motorway access ramps, and four-story terminal building, with 12 gates. The airport regained its international status when flights to [[Caracas]] began. An inter-island domestic area was opened in 2005.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Tenerife North:<ref>{{cite

Today TFN is an inter-island [[airline hub|hub]] connecting all seven of the main [[Canary Islands]] with connections to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Europe]].\n\nOn 27 March 1977, Los Rodeos Airport was the site of the [[Tenerife airport disaster|worst accident in aviation history]], when two [[Boeing 747]]s collided on the runway in heavy fog causing the deaths of 583 passengers and crew.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nMany years before the airport had even been built, the field at Los Rodeos was hastily prepared to accommodate the first (though unofficial) flight into Tenerife operated by an [[Arado V I]] (D-1594) aircraft operating from [[Berlin]] on behalf of [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]].\n\nIn May 1930, the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Subvencionadas S.A. (C.L.A.S.S.A.) established the first air link between the Spanish mainland and the Canary Islands using a [[Ford Trimotor|Ford 4-AT Trimotor]] (M-CKKA), which took off from [[Getafe, Madrid]] to the Los Rodeos field via [[Casablanca]], [[Cape Juby]] and Gando in [[Gran Canaria]].\n\nAfter the final location of the airport had been decided, funds were gathered between 1935 and 1939 to build a small hangar and begin expanding the airstrip which would become Los Rodeos. In July 1936 [[Francisco Franco]] did not fly from here after taking over the island to invade the mainland Spain. He flew from Gando (Gran Canaria), in a DH-89 Dragon Rapide chartered to the British company Olley Air Service.\n\nOperations into Los Rodeos recommenced on 23 January 1941 with a [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide|De Havilland DH89A Dragon Rapide]] operating an [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]] flight from Gando in Gran Canaria. By 1946, more hangars, a passenger terminal and an {{convert|800|m|abbr=on|0}} paved runway had been built, and the airport was officially opened to all national and international traffic. The runway was stretched at various times during the 1940s and 1950s, reaching a length of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on|0}} in 1953, by which time the airport was also equipped with runway edge lighting and an air-ground radio, enabling night operations.\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\nBy 1964, runway 12/30 had been stretched to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on|0}} to accommodate the [[DC-8]], new [[Avionics|navigation aids]] were installed, and the apron was expanded to provide more parking spaces for aircraft. In 1971, with the prospect of the [[Boeing 747]] flying into the airport, the runway was reinforced and an [[Instrument Landing System|ILS (Instrument Landing System)]] was installed.\n\nA new airport, [[Tenerife South Airport]], was inaugurated on 6 November 1978, in response to the 1977 [[Tenerife airport disaster]] which resulted in the highest number of fatalities (excluding ground fatalities) of any single accident in aviation history. The south airport is situated at sea level to avert the occurrence of fog, one of the reasons for the crash.\n\nA new terminal was opened at Tenerife North Airport in 2002, comprising car park, motorway access ramps, and four-story terminal building, with 12 gates. The airport regained its international status when flights to [[Caracas]] began. An inter-island domestic area was opened in 2005.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Tenerife North:<ref>{{cite

The comic contrasts the actions of the titular characters, presenting Gallant's actions as right and good and Goofus's as wrong and bad. Created by Garry Cleveland Myers and first published in ''Children's Activities'' in 1940, ''Goofus and Gallant'' moved to ''Highlights for Children'' when the magazine was founded in 1946.\n\nThroughout its history ''Goofus and Gallant'' has been interpreted as an effective [[didacticism|didactic]] comic. It has been used in several studies as a stimulus to prompt children to identify kind and unkind actions, and the characters of Goofus and Gallant, as archetypes of badness and goodness, have been referenced in several works by philosophers.\n\n==History==\n''Goofus and Gallant'' was created by Garry Cleveland Myers and was first featured in the magazine ''Children's Activities'' in 1940.

The comic contrasts the actions of the titular characters, presenting Gallant's actions as right and good and Goofus's as wrong and bad. Created by Garry Cleveland Myers and first published in ''Children's Activities'' in 1940, ''Goofus and Gallant'' moved to ''Highlights for Children'' when the magazine was founded in 1946.\n\nThroughout its history ''Goofus and Gallant'' has been interpreted as an effective [[didacticism|didactic]] comic. It has been used in several studies as a stimulus to prompt children to identify kind and unkind actions, and the characters of Goofus and Gallant, as archetypes of badness and goodness, have been referenced in several works by philosophers.\n\n==History==\n''Goofus and Gallant'' was created by Garry Cleveland Myers and was first featured in the magazine ''Children's Activities'' in 1940. According to family legend, the grandchildren of Myers and his wife Caroline, Kent Brown and Garry Cleveland Myers III, inspired the characters Goofus and Gallant respectively.<ref name=\"chicagotribune\">{{cite news|last1=Zorn|first1=Eric|title=Goofus, Gallant\u2013the inside story|url=http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2006/06/goofus_gallantt.html|accessdate=December 22, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 4, 1993|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420030344/http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2006/06/goofus_gallantt.html|archivedate=April 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> At first, the comic's characters were depicted as elves. In 1946, when the Myerses founded ''[[Highlights for Children]]'', they brought ''Goofus and Gallant'' with them to the new magazine. By the 1950s, the strip's art style changed and Goofus and Gallant turned from elves to human boys.<ref name=\"chicagotribune\" /> Throughout ''Goofus and Gallant''{{'}}s history, numerous artists have drawn for the strip.
