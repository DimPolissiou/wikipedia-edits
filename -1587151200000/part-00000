[[Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha]] headquartered at [[Chennai]] was formed to spread Hindi in [[South India|South Indian states]]. Regional Hindi implementation offices at [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Guwahati]], [[Bhopal]], [[Delhi]] and [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.\n\nAnnual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the ''Kendriya Hindi Samiti'' (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Language \u2013 Constitutional/Statutory Provisions |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |work=[[Government of India]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417150059/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |archivedate=17 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the government announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in [[South India|Southern]] and [[Northeast India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/centre-to-promote-use-of-hindi-in-south-india-northeast-jitendra-singh/|title=Centre to promote use of Hindi in South India, Northeast:<br/>In response to this several NGO and political parties have started agitation and some have even re-sorted to violent protests in the Darjeeling for separate statehood, which started in after the official statement in press meet by Central parliamentary affairs minister.

Examples include [[Kokborok]] in [[Tripura]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]] in [[Mizoram]].\n\n=== Legislature and administration ===\nThe constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the [[States and union territories of India|State level]] largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their [[official language]], Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their [[mother tongue]] with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.\n\nThe state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in [[public administration]], and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.\n\nIn addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the [[President of India|President]], the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of [[minority language]]s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide [[primary education]] in the mother tongue for all [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]], regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.\n\n=== State judiciary ===\nStates have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state's official language in proceedings of the High Court to the [[Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of states of India|Governor]], rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the [[President of India]], who in these matters acts on the advice of the [[Government of India]]. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court's judgments will be delivered.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) \u2013 Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) \u2013 Section 7 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nFour states\u2014[[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]\u2014<ref>[http://www.barandbench.com/index.php?title=Language%20in%20Courts%20-%20a%20bridge%20or%20a%20barrier?&page=brief&id=805&gn=0 Language in Courts \u2013 a bridge or a barrier?]</ref> have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi.

[[Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha]] headquartered at [[Chennai]] was formed to spread Hindi in [[South India|South Indian states]]. Regional Hindi implementation offices at [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Guwahati]], [[Bhopal]], [[Delhi]] and [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.\n\nAnnual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the ''Kendriya Hindi Samiti'' (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Language \u2013 Constitutional/Statutory Provisions |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |work=[[Government of India]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417150059/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |archivedate=17 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the government announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in [[South India|Southern]] and [[Northeast India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/centre-to-promote-use-of-hindi-in-south-india-northeast-jitendra-singh/|title=Centre to promote use of Hindi in South India, Northeast:<br/>In response to this several NGO and political parties have started agitation and some have even re-sorted to violent protests in the Darjeeling for separate statehood, which started in after the official statement in press meet by Central parliamentary affairs minister.

Examples include [[Kokborok]] in [[Tripura]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]] in [[Mizoram]].\n\n=== Legislature and administration ===\nThe constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the [[States and union territories of India|State level]] largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their [[official language]], Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their [[mother tongue]] with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.\n\nThe state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in [[public administration]], and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.\n\nIn addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the [[President of India|President]], the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of [[minority language]]s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide [[primary education]] in the mother tongue for all [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]], regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.\n\n=== State judiciary ===\nStates have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state's official language in proceedings of the High Court to the [[Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of states of India|Governor]], rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the [[President of India]], who in these matters acts on the advice of the [[Government of India]]. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court's judgments will be delivered.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) \u2013 Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) \u2013 Section 7 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nFour states\u2014[[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]\u2014<ref>[http://www.barandbench.com/index.php?title=Language%20in%20Courts%20-%20a%20bridge%20or%20a%20barrier?&page=brief&id=805&gn=0 Language in Courts \u2013 a bridge or a barrier?]</ref> have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi.

{"title_page": "Oxford Circus fire", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe '''Oxford Circus fire''' occurred on Friday 23 November 1984 at 9.50pm at [[Oxford Circus tube station|Oxford Circus station]] on\nthe [[London Underground]]. Oxford Circus station is in the heart of [[London]]'s shopping district and is served by three deep-level tube lines: the [[Bakerloo line]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] and [[Victoria line]]. The three lines are linked by a complex network of tunnels and cross-passages which all converge to a common booking hall situated beneath the junction of Oxford Street and Regent Street.\n\nThe fire started in a materials store at the south end of the northbound Victoria line platform, which was being used by contractors working on the modernisation of the station.  It gutted the northbound Victoria line platform tunnel and the passages leading off it.  The adjacent northbound Bakerloo line platform suffered smoke damage, as did the escalator tunnel and the booking hall.  Other areas of the station were undamaged.  The most likely cause of the fire was a [[Tobacco smoking|smoker]] discarding smoking materials through a ventilation grille into the materials store, which ignited rags or paint thinner.\n\n==Discovery==\nAt 9.50pm, a station inspector, on duty in the mezzanine level, was told by a passenger of smoke on the northbound Victoria line platform. He took a piece of wood with him down to the platform, expecting to deal with something smouldering on the track. When he saw that it was the contractors' storage area on fire, he tried to use a telephone in a kiosk nearby, but opening the door of the kiosk released thick smoke that drove him back. He then retreated and started the evacuation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=1187 | title=The Fire on 23rd November 1984 at Oxford Circus station: Enquiry Report | publisher=Railways Archive | date=1984 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | author=London Regional Transport.}}</ref>\n\n==Evacuation==\nOxford Circus station was rapidly evacuated when the fire was discovered, and the [[London Fire Brigade]] conducted a sweep of the station which confirmed that all passengers were clear.  The fire alert disrupted the routes of 10 trains on the three lines: passengers on six of the trains were evacuated at stations and passengers on four trains were escorted down the running tunnels to adjacent stations.  The last passenger evacuated from these trains left the track at 12.45am.  30 pumps attended the fire, which was declared extinguished just before 3am the next day.\n\n==Injuries==\nNo-one was killed as a result of the fire; 14 people (four passengers, one police officer and nine members of London Underground staff) were taken to hospital for [[smoke inhalation]], of whom all but one were released next day.\n\n==Reconstruction==\nThe gutted areas of the station had to be completely reconstructed, which in the case of the Victoria line platform tunnel involved sealing the ends so that the waterproof lining of the platform tunnel could be removed without releasing [[asbestos]] fibres into the atmosphere of the Underground.  The removal took just over three weeks.  Passenger services were restarted on the Central line the following morning.  Northbound Bakerloo line trains were not permitted to stop at the station until 30 November, by which time the access tunnels to the Bakerloo northbound platform had been cleared of fire damage.\n\n==Effects on services==\nVictoria line service through central London and to the station recommenced on 17 December, with the platform tunnel having been stripped of all fittings down to the tunnel segment rings. Wooden hoardings were erected at the rear of the platform and the entire platform tunnel was whitewashed. Reconstruction of the decorative fittings on the platform was not completed until early 1986.\n\n==Smoking bans==\nWhilst [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] had been banned on London Underground trains since July 1984, at the time of the Oxford Circus fire it was still allowed in stations. In response to the fire, a complete [[smoking ban|ban on smoking]] in all sub-surface stations was introduced in February 1985.<ref>D.

The resulting fire killed 31 people. After the King's Cross fire, staff training was increased and the smoking ban was enforced much more strictly with fines being introduced for offenders.{{cite needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* T.

[[n-Butyllithium]] undergoes a [[Organolithium reagent|halogen-lithium exchange]] reaction with the bromide at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to yield the intermediate '''c'''. The intermediate '''b''' is then added to a solution containing intermediate '''c''' dropwise. After quenching the reaction in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, a mixture of 1: 1 [[anomer]]s was obtained. It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with [[boron trichloride]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained. The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase [[high-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]. The optically pure compound and intermediate '''a''' are reacted with trimethyl phosphate and methylimidazole to obtain a [[diastereomer]] mixture of remdesivir. In the end, optically pure remdesivir can be obtained through [[chiral resolution]] methods.\n\n==Access==\nOn 20 March 2020, President Trump announced that remdesivir was available for \"[[compassionate use]]\" by people with COVID-19; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn confirmed the statement at the same press conference.<!--Apologies, but the following definition does not capture the definition provided at the corresponding Wikipedia article on the subject, and so creates unnecessary contradiction.

There is a public restroom and a small Eastern National retail shop. Visitors can view the exhibits and photographs and watch a film.\n\n'''Living room'''  \nVisitors to the Kennedy home would have been shown into the living room, or parlor as it would have been called when the family lived there. Here, visitors can see both a space for formal entertaining within the home, but also a space where the family would relax in the evenings when the children were getting ready for bed and when Joe Kennedy returned from his office in Boston.  The piano dominating the parlor belonged to Rose Kennedy and is one of the original pieces in the home. It was a wedding gift from two of her uncles.\n\n'''Dining room'''<ref>NPS Historic Furnishings Assessment</ref>\nThe dining room has the home's most complete collection of Kennedy artifacts. The china was Rose's wedding china. The table would not have been set with a formal place setting for day to day meals. Rose Kennedy sets the table this way because as she is turning the house into a museum, she is expecting company. Meals were a time for the family to have lively discussions about topics that ranged from history, to politics, current events and religion. Rose was fond of saying \"history is shaped by those who get their ideas across\"<ref>Kennedy, Rose Fitzgerald. ''Times to Remember''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1974.</ref> and mealtime discussions were a staple in the Kennedy home. Meals were a formal affair, with the family assembling in the dining room and the food brought from the kitchen by a uniformed maid.\n\n'''Master bedroom'''\nThe master bedroom is where Jack, Rosemary and Kathleen Kennedy were born. Jack Kennedy was born at 3:00pm on May 29, 1917.<ref>Goodwin</ref>  Rose Kennedy had seven of her nine children at home, and the same doctor, Dr. Good, delivered all of them, as well as the final two who were born in a hospital. The bedroom has several photographs, including the 6 month old baby pictures of Joe Jr., Jack, Rosemary, and Kathleen.\n\n'''Nursery'''\nThe nursery has a bassinet that will eventually hold each of the nine Kennedy children, as well as a christening cap, gown, and a number of books and toys Joe Jr. and Jack would have played with. Visitors can see Jack's two favorite books: \"King Arthur and his Knights\" and \"Billy Whiskers and His Kids.\"\n\n'''Guest bedroom'''\nThe guest bedroom showcases linens bearing Rose's initials - REF - and Rosemary Kennedy's toiletry set. The guest room was converted to a girl's bedroom as soon as Rosemary and Kathleen were born.\n\n'''Boudoir'''\nThe boudoir was Rose's private space as well as her office space. She would use the desk to keep track of the accounts of the household and to do her correspondence.  The desk showcases a card file. Rose kept an index card for each of her children where she would list important milestones in their medical history - things like vaccinations, major illnesses and hospital stays, as well as birthdays and confirmation dates. Jack Kennedy's card is on the desk.\n\n'''Kitchen'''\nThe kitchen would have been the domain of the household's servants. It is modern for the time; the stove is a combination coal and gas, the family has an electric toaster as well as a large icebox.  Servants would have frequented the kitchen and the basement, which at the time would have been used for laundry.\n\n'''3rd floor'''   \nThe third floor is not included on the tours. It has two attic rooms the servants used. Rose Kennedy hired both a French and an Irish girl, Alice Michelin and Mary O'Donahue<ref name=autogenerated1 /> as the maid-of-all-work and nanny in the house. Their bedrooms were on the third floor. More information on domestic servants is on the park's [http://www.nps.gov/jofi website]. The third floor was not restored by Rose Kennedy along with the rest of the house in the 1960s. This was due to the fact she did not have a complete memory of those rooms. Today, they are the park's administrative offices.\n\n==Visiting information==\nDuring the 2017 season (May\u2013October), John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site offers daily guided tours. Ranger-guided tours are available every half hour from 10:00\u201311:30 and 1:00\u20133:30. The tours are 30 minutes long. Self-guided tours are available from 12:00\u20131:00 and 4:00\u20135:00.

The family lived there until 1920, when the growth of the family motivated the Kennedys to move to a larger home just a few blocks away on the corner of Abbottsford and Naples Roads, just outside [[Boston]].<ref>https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/life-of-john-f-kennedy</ref> The Kennedys sold the Beals Street house to Joe Kennedy's advisor Edward Moore and his family. The Kennedys lived in the Abbottsford Road home until 1927, when Joe Kennedy's business interests prompted the family's move to [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], New York City.\n\nThe Kennedy family was the third owner of the house on Beals Street. It was built in 1909, a period of rapid growth in Brookline. The Kennedys moved into the home, then the last on the street, after returning from their honeymoon in 1914. A few months after they were married, Joe Kennedy purchased a new [[Model T Ford]] that he used to commute to downtown, where he worked as the president of the Columbia Trust Bank. The \"T\" line to Coolidge Corner existed when the Kennedys were living in Brookline. Rose Kennedy would often walk from the Beals Street house down to the shopping district in Coolidge Corner, where there was an [[S.S. Pierce]] store\u2014which replaced the Coolidge & Brothers General Store\u2014among the other shops. Brookline was a rapidly growing suburb of Boston, and it appealed to the growing Kennedy family because the suburbs would have more space for the children to play than if they were raised in the crowded inner city of Boston.<ref>Goodwin, Doris Kearns. ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Kennedy family repurchased the home. From 1966 to 1969, Rose Kennedy restored it to her recollection of its 1917 appearance. She wanted to restore the home to the hour of John's birth, but the home really paints a picture of a typical American home 1914\u20131920. About 19% of the artifacts in the home are original to the Kennedy family, either used in the Beals Street residence or in later homes and returned to Beals Street during the restoration. Rose Kennedy worked with an interior designer named Robert Luddington as she restored the home, and he was largely in charge of procuring the rest of the items in the home, which are either period antiques or reproductions.\n\nRose Kennedy donated the home to the [[National Park Service]] in 1967 as a memorial to her son. It is open to the public and visitors can take a ranger-guided tour or self-guided tours through the home.\n\n==Description==\n'''The house:'''<ref name=autogenerated1>NPS Historic Resource Study {{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/jofi/learn/management/upload/John-F-Kennedy-NHS-Historic-Resource-Study.pdf |title=John F.

Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract.

In 2012, the FAA selected [[Harris Corporation|Harris Corp.]], which then subcontracted [[Dataprobe]], to develop the [[National Airspace System Voice Switch|NAS Voice System]] and manage a $331 million Data Communications Integrated Services contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/09/harris-corporation-awarded-331-million-contract-by-faa-for-data/|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $331 Million Contract by FAA for Data Communications Integrated Services Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/08/harris-corporation-awarded-291-million-contract-to-provide-federal-aviation|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $291 Million Contract to Provide Federal Aviation Administration's New National Air Traffic Control Communications System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCommercial airlines also became involved in NextGen. In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|title=FAA Modernization and Reform Act (P.L. 112-095) Reports and Plans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811143229/http://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|archive-date=2014-08-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> included establishing deadlines for adopting existing NextGen navigation and surveillance technology and mandated development of precision navigational procedures at the nation's 35 busiest airports by 2015.\n\nIn 2010, the FAA's Aviation Safety organization released a work plan that identified how the safety staff would set NextGen standards and oversee safe implementation of new technologies, processes, and procedures. The FAA also issued a final rule mandating NextGen performance requirements for aircraft surveillance equipment. It requires aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020.\n\n==Justification==\nA Department of Transportation 30-year outlook report published in 2016, \u201cBeyond Traffic: Trends and Choices 2045,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/beyond-traffic-2045-final-report|title=Beyond Traffic: 2045 Final Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> estimated flight delays and congestion cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment.

It is not one technology, product, or goal; but rather, it encompasses many technologies and procedures that are being developed and implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions.

Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure. A new route structure makes straighter paths possible for greater efficiency, and more routes can fit into the same airspace, which increases capacity. From 2009\u20132016, PBN procedures available nearly tripled at airports across the nation. As of December 2019, the FAA has published more than 9,600 PBN procedures and routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/procedures/ifp_inventory_summary/|title=Instrument Flight Procedures (IFP) Inventory Summary|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2019|website=Federal Aviation Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These consist of RNAV [[standard instrument departure]]s, T-Routes (1,200 feet above the surface to 18,000 feet of altitude), Q-Routes (18,000\u201345,000 feet of altitude), RNAV [[Standard terminal arrival route|standard terminal arrivals]] (STAR), RNAV (GPS) approaches, and RNP approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the airports that publish [[instrument approach]] procedures, 96 percent publish PBN approach procedures and 31 percent use only PBN approach procedures.\n\nRNAV STAR procedures can provide a [[continuous descent approach]] also known as an optimized profile descent from cruising altitude to save fuel and reduce emissions and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/houston-nextgen-plane-descents/|title=Planes Are Finally Making Logical Descents Onto American Runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA has published many RNAV STAR procedures with this capability that enable aircraft to fly closer to the airport at a more fuel-efficient altitude before descending, which also saves fuel by eliminating level-offs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|title=New Analysis Shows Big Benefits at Minneapolis International Airport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628094052/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|archive-date=2017-06-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|title=Changes to Houston\u2019s Airspace Bring Millions in Benefits to Local Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201103647/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|archive-date=2016-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> These procedures can be flown when available and when pilots are able to use them.\n\nUsing the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]]<nowiki/>, instrument-rated pilots now can land at airports where that was previously impossible using just [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]<nowiki/>.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts. Integration of ADS-B into en route and terminal automation platforms was completed in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=94678|title=FAA Successfully Completes Final ADS-B Milestone|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2019|work=FAA News and Updates|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is evaluating space-based ADS-B surveillance services for oceanic airspace as part of a project called Advanced Surveillance Enhanced Procedural Separation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/faa-takes-steps-toward-space-based-ads-b-track-aircraft|title=FAA Takes Steps Toward Space-Based ADS-B To Track Aircraft|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2019|work=Aviation Week|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Moving from the current system of ADS-B ground stations to radios hosted on satellites offers the potential for reduced separation standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2017/04/27/faa-aireon-announce-space-based-ads-b-flight-test-success/|title=FAA and Aireon Announce Space-Based ADS-B Flight Test Success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-05-15/faa-nav-canada-and-aireon-test-space-based-ads-b|title=FAA, Nav Canada and Aireon Test Space-based ADS-B|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getconnected.aero/2017/04/faa-aireon-next-gen-ads-b/|title=FAA and Aireon announce next-gen ADS-B test success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Even with the capabilities offered by ADS-B through satellite technology, surveillance radar is still relevant and will be used as a supplement and ultimately as backup to ADS-B in the event of service disruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|title=Global Advance Of ADS-B|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926145530/http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|archive-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>\n\n==== ADS-B Out ====\nWith ADS-B Out, surveillance coverage increases because ground stations can be provided in locations where obstructions or physical limitations don't allow radar.

They help to achieve NextGen goals of safely increasing access, efficiency, and throughput at many airports when low visibility is the limiting factor. [[Head-up display]]s (HUD) <nowiki/>were approved to use on a precision approach to lower minimum decision heights to land. Use of a qualified HUD when flying to a suitable [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System]]<nowiki/> facility will reduce the required runway visual range visibility for approach.\n\nThe FAA allows the use of an [[enhanced flight vision system]] (EFVS)<nowiki/> instead of natural vision to conduct an instrument landing procedure in low-visibility conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|title=New FAA Rules Let Technology Replace Natural Vision|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111151324/http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|archive-date=2017-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/FAA-Expands-Enhanced-Vision-Capabilities-228201-1.html|title=FAA Expands Enhanced Vision Capabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> EFVS uses sensor technologies to provide a clear, real-time virtual image to the pilot of the view outside the aircraft, regardless of the cloud cover and visibility conditions. Pilots can identify required visual references that would be impossible without it. It provides access that otherwise would be denied because of low visibility. A [[Synthetic vision system|synthetic vision guidance system]]<nowiki/> combines flight guidance display technology with high-precision position assurance monitors to provide a continuous and correct depiction of the external scene and runway. It can assist a pilot's transition to natural vision references. A project also is under way to enable taxiing at airports in low-visibility conditions.\n\nAnother NextGen project is the Ground Based Augmentation System Landing System (GBAS). It uses GPS to support all precision-approach categories. Newark and Houston operate non-federal GBAS systems approved for operations to as low as 200 feet above the runway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/delivering/oiaa/investments/|title=NextGen Operator Investments|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502100203/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/delivering/oiaa/investments/|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter a reduction of minimum visual runway range requirements, an FAA assessment showed airport access during low-visibility conditions improved in two ways: almost 6 percent fewer periods of time with no access and 17 percent more flights could land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|title=NextGen Operational Performance Assessment September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429034552/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/NGPA_2015.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nInitial tailored arrivals are available for certain aircraft flying into San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Miami. These arrivals are planned, fixed routes for aircraft approaching these airports from oceanic airspace that are communicated via a data link from the air traffic controller. They limit vectoring and minimize the time the aircraft spends maintaining level flight during descent, which reduces fuel consumption, aircraft exhaust emissions, and time in flight. These differ from Performance Based Navigation's optimized profile descents because they are tailored to the characteristics of a limited number of aircraft types equipped with the [[Future Air Navigation System]].<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf|title=2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System based on the Future of the NAS Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804121920/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cms.dot.gov/content/benefits-next-generation-air-transportation-system|title=The Benefits of the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2005/05/01/tailored-arrivals-idling-down-to-the-final-approach/|title=Tailored Arrivals: Idling Down to the Final Approach|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Airport Mapping ===\nThe FAA Office of Airports [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) <nowiki/>program provides data to manage aeronautical information and NextGen implementation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0315/esri-solution-helps-airports-meet-new-faa-rules|title=Esri Solution Helps Airports Meet New FAA Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> GIS identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features or boundaries on the earth's surface.

The FAA Office of Environment and Energy Research and Development is working to reduce air and water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions that may affect climate, and noise that can disturb residents near airports. Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016. The FAA will use those results and other research under way to re-evaluate criteria to define significance under the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]<nowiki/> and federal land use guidelines. In addition, the FAA is conducting research in other impact areas, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular health, and children's learning. The FAA also is examining the potential noise impacts of new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems, civil supersonic aircraft, and commercial space vehicles.\n\nThe Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) program is a public-private partnership under NextGen to accelerate development and commercial deployment of more-efficient technologies and sustainable alternative fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|title=Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000308/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|archive-date=2011-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first five-year agreement with manufacturers produced jet engine, wing, and aerodynamic technologies; automation and flight management systems; fuels; and materials from 2010\u20132015.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions. It replaces the 1970s-era \u201csmoke number\u201d \u2014 a figure that describes the visibility of emissions \u2014 with a much more accurate measure of emissions particles.\n\n=== Safety ===\nThe FAA's safety program is guided by its [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]] <nowiki/>\u2014 an agency-wide approach that directs the management of NextGen initiatives. NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Research Council]] noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2017-05-17_-_full_committee_ssm.pdf|title=Committee Hearing on \"The Need to Reform FAA and Air Traffic Control to Build a 21st Century Aviation System for America\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400893|title=Latest Inspector General Report Underscores Need for Air Traffic Control Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of NextGen has led to a renewed push to reform air traffic control, supported by the Trump Administration, that would move this function from the government to a not-for-profit, independent entity managed by a professional board of directors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/05/president-donald-j-trumps-principles-reforming-us-air-traffic-control|title=President Donald J.

The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) began work on NextGen improvements in 2007 and plans to have all major components in place by 2025.<ref>[https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf 2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System] based on the Future of the NAS Report</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe goals of the modernization include using new technologies and procedures to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the [[environmental impact of aviation]].\n\n== History ==\nThe need for NextGen became apparent during the summer of 2000 when air travel was impeded by severe congestion and costly delays. Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract. [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], and [[ITT Inc.|ITT Corp.]] received FAA contracts worth up to $4.4 billion to conduct large-scale demonstrations to see how NextGen concepts, procedures, and technologies could be integrated into the current NAS. In 2012, the FAA selected [[Harris Corporation|Harris Corp.]], which then subcontracted [[Dataprobe]], to develop the [[National Airspace System Voice Switch|NAS Voice System]] and manage a $331 million Data Communications Integrated Services contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/09/harris-corporation-awarded-331-million-contract-by-faa-for-data/|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $331 Million Contract by FAA for Data Communications Integrated Services Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/08/harris-corporation-awarded-291-million-contract-to-provide-federal-aviation|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $291 Million Contract to Provide Federal Aviation Administration's New National Air Traffic Control Communications System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCommercial airlines also became involved in NextGen. In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff.

The FAA also issued a final rule mandating NextGen performance requirements for aircraft surveillance equipment. It requires aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020.\n\n==Justification==\nA Department of Transportation 30-year outlook report published in 2016, \u201cBeyond Traffic: Trends and Choices 2045,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/beyond-traffic-2045-final-report|title=Beyond Traffic: 2045 Final Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> estimated flight delays and congestion cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment.

It is not one technology, product, or goal; but rather, it encompasses many technologies and procedures that are being developed and implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions. It lowers the chances of delays or cancellations when weather affects the flight route. Pilots and controllers also can spend more time on other critical tasks, which enhances safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20160624/lax-unveils-data-comm-aircraft-texting-system-designed-to-reduce-flight-delays|title=LAX unveils Data Comm aircraft texting system designed to reduce flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kutv.com/news/local/new-data-comm-reduces-wait-time-on-slc-runways|title=New Data Comm system reduces wait time on SLC runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|title=Pilots, air traffic controllers shifting to text messaging|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235508/https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|archive-date=2018-01-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ohare-pilot-texting-0930-biz-20160929-story.html|title=Pilots to start texting at O'Hare, Midway \u2014 but it's not what you think|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/faa-shows-off-new-air-traffic-communications-at-msp/419214164/|title=\"FAA shows off new air-traffic communications at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-flights-benefiting-from-new-text-based-tech-faa-says-1.13276922|title=NYC flights benefiting from new text-based tech, FAA says|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/pilot-text-messages-are-saving-you-from-flight-delays/|title=Pilot text messages are saving you from flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-09-28/faa-accelerates-data-communications-roll-out-atc-towers|title=FAA Accelerates Data Communications Roll Out to ATC Towers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/27/airlines-flight-controllers-data-communications/91177576/|title=Less chat, more action for airlines, flight controllers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crankyflier.com/2016/06/28/a-demo-on-how-data-comm-is-going-to-make-flying-better/|title=A Demo On How Data Comm Is Going to Make Flying Better|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/new-direct-digital-link-between-tower-and-cockpit-will-speed-planes-on-their-way/2016/09/27/50eb9ec8-843b-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html|title=New direct digital link between tower and cockpit will speed planes on their way|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBased on Data Comm's success, air carriers requested and the FAA approved in 2017 seven more airports to receive tower services to be completed by 2019.

More types of air traffic controller messages will be available, including the ability to reroute multiple aircraft.

In critical situations, they continue to be the primary form of controller-pilot interaction. For routine communications between pilots and controllers, Data Comm will increase efficiency and airspace capacity. Data Comm is expected to save operators more than $10 billion over the 30-year life cycle of the program and the FAA about $1 billion in future operating costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Data Communications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313110025/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Navigation ===\n[[Performance-based navigation|Performance Based Navigation]] (PBN) is an [[instrument flight rules]]<nowiki/> way of moving through airspace that varies depending equipage, navigational aids, and pilot training. Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure. A new route structure makes straighter paths possible for greater efficiency, and more routes can fit into the same airspace, which increases capacity. From 2009\u20132016, PBN procedures available nearly tripled at airports across the nation. As of December 2019, the FAA has published more than 9,600 PBN procedures and routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/procedures/ifp_inventory_summary/|title=Instrument Flight Procedures (IFP) Inventory Summary|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2019|website=Federal Aviation Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These consist of RNAV [[standard instrument departure]]s, T-Routes (1,200 feet above the surface to 18,000 feet of altitude), Q-Routes (18,000\u201345,000 feet of altitude), RNAV [[Standard terminal arrival route|standard terminal arrivals]] (STAR), RNAV (GPS) approaches, and RNP approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the airports that publish [[instrument approach]] procedures, 96 percent publish PBN approach procedures and 31 percent use only PBN approach procedures.\n\nRNAV STAR procedures can provide a [[continuous descent approach]] also known as an optimized profile descent from cruising altitude to save fuel and reduce emissions and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/houston-nextgen-plane-descents/|title=Planes Are Finally Making Logical Descents Onto American Runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA has published many RNAV STAR procedures with this capability that enable aircraft to fly closer to the airport at a more fuel-efficient altitude before descending, which also saves fuel by eliminating level-offs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|title=New Analysis Shows Big Benefits at Minneapolis International Airport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628094052/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|archive-date=2017-06-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|title=Changes to Houston\u2019s Airspace Bring Millions in Benefits to Local Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201103647/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|archive-date=2016-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> These procedures can be flown when available and when pilots are able to use them.\n\nUsing the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]]<nowiki/>, instrument-rated pilots now can land at airports where that was previously impossible using just [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]<nowiki/>.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts.

For independent runways, aircraft can approach without having to maintain a staggered diagonal separation required by dependent operations. Further revisions to closely spaced parallel operations were included in the November 2015 update to [[FAA Order 7110.65]], Air Traffic Control<nowiki/>.\n\nThe new procedures reduce lateral separation requirements to as close as 3,900 feet for triple independent approaches, and 3,000 feet for offset dual independent approaches without requiring high-update-rate radar or Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast. For dual dependent approaches, the runway spacing requirement remains 2,500 feet, but the diagonal spacing is reduced from 1.5 nautical mile (nm) to 1&nbsp;nm.\n\nFAA Order 7110.308C identifies specific airports \u2014 Boston, Cleveland, Memphis, Newark, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco, and St. Louis \u2014 with runways spaced less than 2,500 feet apart that can reduce staggered spacing between aircraft on parallel approaches from 1.5&nbsp;nm to 1&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/working_together/airports/|title=NextGen Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518055951/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/working_together/airports/|archive-date=2018-05-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Converging Runway Display Aid is an automation tool used by air traffic controllers to manage the sequence of arrival flows on converging or intersecting runways.

They help to achieve NextGen goals of safely increasing access, efficiency, and throughput at many airports when low visibility is the limiting factor. [[Head-up display]]s (HUD) <nowiki/>were approved to use on a precision approach to lower minimum decision heights to land. Use of a qualified HUD when flying to a suitable [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System]]<nowiki/> facility will reduce the required runway visual range visibility for approach.\n\nThe FAA allows the use of an [[enhanced flight vision system]] (EFVS)<nowiki/> instead of natural vision to conduct an instrument landing procedure in low-visibility conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|title=New FAA Rules Let Technology Replace Natural Vision|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111151324/http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|archive-date=2017-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/FAA-Expands-Enhanced-Vision-Capabilities-228201-1.html|title=FAA Expands Enhanced Vision Capabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> EFVS uses sensor technologies to provide a clear, real-time virtual image to the pilot of the view outside the aircraft, regardless of the cloud cover and visibility conditions. Pilots can identify required visual references that would be impossible without it. It provides access that otherwise would be denied because of low visibility. A [[Synthetic vision system|synthetic vision guidance system]]<nowiki/> combines flight guidance display technology with high-precision position assurance monitors to provide a continuous and correct depiction of the external scene and runway. It can assist a pilot's transition to natural vision references. A project also is under way to enable taxiing at airports in low-visibility conditions.\n\nAnother NextGen project is the Ground Based Augmentation System Landing System (GBAS).

These arrivals are planned, fixed routes for aircraft approaching these airports from oceanic airspace that are communicated via a data link from the air traffic controller. They limit vectoring and minimize the time the aircraft spends maintaining level flight during descent, which reduces fuel consumption, aircraft exhaust emissions, and time in flight.

The FAA Office of Environment and Energy Research and Development is working to reduce air and water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions that may affect climate, and noise that can disturb residents near airports. Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016. The FAA will use those results and other research under way to re-evaluate criteria to define significance under the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]<nowiki/> and federal land use guidelines. In addition, the FAA is conducting research in other impact areas, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular health, and children's learning. The FAA also is examining the potential noise impacts of new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems, civil supersonic aircraft, and commercial space vehicles.\n\nThe Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) program is a public-private partnership under NextGen to accelerate development and commercial deployment of more-efficient technologies and sustainable alternative fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|title=Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000308/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|archive-date=2011-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first five-year agreement with manufacturers produced jet engine, wing, and aerodynamic technologies; automation and flight management systems; fuels; and materials from 2010\u20132015.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions. It replaces the 1970s-era \u201csmoke number\u201d \u2014 a figure that describes the visibility of emissions \u2014 with a much more accurate measure of emissions particles.\n\n=== Safety ===\nThe FAA's safety program is guided by its [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]] <nowiki/>\u2014 an agency-wide approach that directs the management of NextGen initiatives. NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

Led by airline executives and others from the aviation community with an intimate understanding of shared challenges and opportunities, the NAC conducts its business in public so that deliberations and findings are transparent.\n\nIn 2014, the NAC developed a joint three-year implementation plan for delivering new capabilities with near-term benefits to airports across the country. The process of developing and monitoring this plan provided all parties with a better understanding about planning decisions and has bolstered trust and cooperation among all parties. This collaborative plan, delivered to Congress in October 2014 and updated annually since then, outlined milestones for delivering benefits in a one- to three-year timeframe. The high-readiness capabilities are improvements in Performance Based Navigation, Data Communications, surface operations, and improved multiple runway operations, and at the end of fiscal year 2017, the FAA had completed 157 commitments in these areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2014/06/05/the-four-new-priorities-of-nextgen/|title=The Four New Priorities of NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/319040-a-missed-opportunity-for-the-aviation-community|title=A missed opportunity for the aviation community|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gcn.com/Articles/2017/03/20/FAA-data-comm.aspx|title=NextGen expands digital communications between pilots, tower|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2017/02/08/airspace-integration-tech.aspx|title=Airspace Integration Takes More Than Tech|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A fifth focus area, Northeast Corridor, was established in 2017 to improve operations in the busy airspace between Washington, D.C. and Boston.

In many cases, foundational systems are installed on aircraft as well as on the ground. The interoperability of air and ground systems, along with the need to synchronize equipage and other industry investments with FAA programs, has been a primary challenge to date. Standards, regulations, and procedures have to be developed. Program execution planning has to look at cost, schedule, and technical performance. Stakeholder buy-in in areas such as equipage and using new capabilities must be ongoing, and all involved \u2014 industry, federal agencies, government partners, and Congress \u2014 must be on the same path ahead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\nIndustry and the FAA need to invest to make progress, and the FAA needs adequate and stable funding.

Due to the integrated nature of NextGen, many of its component systems are mutually dependent on one or more other systems. The FAA implements systems through segments that the stakeholder community agrees are useful and that balance costs and benefits. The FAA will have delivered initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide all anticipated NextGen benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Story of NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== New entrants ===\nThe demand for access to airspace by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and commercial spacecraft is evolving, and the FAA must accommodate changing needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/americas-plan-somehow-make-drones-not-ruin-skies/|title=America's Plan to Somehow Make Drones Not Ruin the Skies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA is pursuing ways to safely and efficiently integrate these new entrants into the National Airspace System (NAS) with minimal impact on other NAS users. This involves determining the required automation support, as well as the surveillance, communication, and navigation capabilities that account for the unique performance characteristics of UAS, and space launch and re-entry vehicles.

The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

The FAA's implementation of this approach has led to unclear and inconsistent reporting on overall program costs, schedules, and benefits. Notwithstanding reforms, several underlying and systemic issues \u2014 including overambitious plans, shifting requirements, software development problems, ineffective contract and program management, and unreliable cost and schedule estimates \u2014 affect the FAA's ability to introduce new technologies and capabilities that are critical to transitioning to NextGen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/news/show/1014429.html/|title=Inspector General Report Shows FAA Is Failing and Why a Non-Profit Should Manage Air Traffic Control|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/32908|title=FAA Reforms Have Not Achieved Expected Cost, Efficiency, and Modernization Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring a meeting with air carrier CEOs shortly after taking office, [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] claimed that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] spent more than $7 billion to upgrade the system and \u201ctotally failed.\u201d However, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a speech that NextGen has already provided $2.7 billion in benefits, and is on track to provide more than $157 billion more by 2030.

The National Research Council's 2015 \u201cReview of the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d report explains that NextGen needs an explicit system architecture \u2014 in addition to its existing enterprise architecture  \u2014 to guide its development, manage risk, and cope with change. To create this architecture, FAA should build an architecture community and also strengthen its work force in several technical fields. The report also examines the incorporation of cybersecurity, unmanned aircraft systems, and human factors into the NextGen architecture. Finally, the report considers NextGen's anticipated costs and benefits, noting that airlines are not motivated to spend money on NextGen because they receive few direct benefits and face schedule uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21721|title=FAA Should 'Reset Expectations' for Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Noise ===\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jdasolutions.aero/blog/nextgen-noise-study/|title=NextGen Noise: RNP\u2019s concentrated IMPACT may justify substantive change in FAA policies under a proper study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|title=FAA facing backlash over noise issues created by PBN flight paths|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021124915/http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/advances-in-airport-technology-mean-sleepless-nights-for-some/2016/03/04/7b8eb936-e098-11e5-9c36-e1902f6b6571_story.html|title=Advances in airport technology mean sleepless nights for some|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aireform.com/a-closer-look-at-how-faa-is-tone-deaf-on-nextgen-noise-impacts/|title=A Closer Look at How FAA is \u2018Tone-Deaf\u2019 on NextGen Noise Impacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectparkquietskies.org/Maurice_Implications_Enviro_NextGen.pdf|title=Implications of Administration Environmental Requirements for NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes.

The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Research Council]] noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2017-05-17_-_full_committee_ssm.pdf|title=Committee Hearing on \"The Need to Reform FAA and Air Traffic Control to Build a 21st Century Aviation System for America\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400893|title=Latest Inspector General Report Underscores Need for Air Traffic Control Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of NextGen has led to a renewed push to reform air traffic control, supported by the Trump Administration, that would move this function from the government to a not-for-profit, independent entity managed by a professional board of directors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/05/president-donald-j-trumps-principles-reforming-us-air-traffic-control|title=President Donald J.
