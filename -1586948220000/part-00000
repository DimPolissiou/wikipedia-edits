It is at the south-center of the modern [[Turkey]] and known locally as [[\u00c7ukurova]].\n\nCilicia has been a crossroad for cultures, religions and ethnicities throughout the history. Anatolian civilizations, Romans, Greeks, Armenians, Arabs and Turks resided and built civilizations at the region.\nCilicia existed as a political entity from the [[Hittites|Hittite]] era until the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], during the late [[Byzantine Empire]]. The region was continued to be called Cilicia internationally, during the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]. After World War I, Cilicia again appeared as a political entity during the three years' of French rule. The name was unused after the foundation of the Turkish Republic, together with other regional names like [[Cappadocia]] and [[Lycia]]. It is getting attention in the last decades, as Cilicia has now been used in many brand names in the [[Adana Province|Adana]] and [[Mersin Province|Mersin]] provinces.\n\n==Geography and etymology==\nCilicia extended along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast east from [[Pamphylia]], to the [[Nur Mountains]], which separated it from [[Syria]]. North and east of Cilicia lie the rugged [[Taurus Mountains]] that separate it from the high central plateau of Anatolia, which are pierced by a narrow gorge, called in antiquity the [[Cilician Gates]].<ref>Ramsay, William Mitchell (1908) ''The Cities of St. Paul Their Influence on His Life and Thought: The cities of Eastern Asia Minor'' A.C.

The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, and that the united rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, [[Adana]] (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.<ref name=EB1911/>\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Cilicia shows significant differences at the mountains and the lower plains. At the lower plains, the climate reflects a typical [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]; summers are hot and dry, winters are warm and rainy. In the coldest month (January), the average temperature is 9&nbsp;\u00b0C, and in the warmest month (August), the average temperature is 28&nbsp;\u00b0C. Mountains of Cilicia have an inland climate with snowy winters. The average annual precipitation in the region is 647mm and the average number of rainy days in a year is 76. [[Mersin]] and surrounding areas have the highest average temperature in Cilicia. Mersin also has a high annual precipitation (1096mm) and 85 rainy days in a year.\n\n===Geology===\nThe Mountains of Cilicia are formed from ancient limestones, [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], marlstone and similar materials. The lower plain is the largest [[alluvial plain]] in Turkey. Expansion of limestone formations and fourth era alluvials brought by the rivers [[Seyhan River|Seyhan]] and [[Ceyhan River|Ceyhan]], formed the plains of the region over the course of time.\n\n[[Akyatan Lagoon|Akyatan]], Akyayan, Salt Lake, Seven lakes at Alada\u011f, and Karstik Dipsiz lake near [[Karaisal\u0131]] are the lakes of the region. The reservoirs in the region are Seyhan, \u00c7atalan, Yedig\u00f6ze, Kozan and Mehmetli.\n\nThe major rivers in Cilicia are [[Seyhan River|Seyhan]], [[Ceyhan River|Ceyhan]], [[Berdan River|Berdan (Tarsus)]], [[Orontes River|Asi]] and [[G\u00f6ksu]].\n\n*[[Seyhan River]] emerges from the confluence of Zamant\u0131 and G\u00f6ksu rivers which originate from [[Kayseri Province]] and flows into the Gulf of Mersin. The river is 560&nbsp;km long.\n*[[Ceyhan River]] emerges from the confluence of Aksu and Hurman rivers and flows into Cape H\u00fcrm\u00fcz at the [[Gulf of \u0130skenderun]]. It is 509&nbsp;km long and it forms the Akyayan, Akyatan and Kakarat lakes before flowing into the Mediterranean.\n*[[Berdan River]] originates from the [[Taurus Mountains]] and flows into the Mediterranean, south of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]].\n*[[G\u00f6ksu]] river originates from the [[Taurus Mountains]] and flows into the Mediterranean, 16&nbsp;km southeast of [[Silifke]]. It forms the delta of G\u00f6ksu, including Akg\u00f6l Lake and Paradeniz Lagoon.\n*[[Orontes River|Asi River (Orontes)]] rises in the great springs of [[Labweh]] on the side of the [[Beqaa Valley]] and it runs due north, parallel with the coast and flows into the Mediterranean just south of the little port of [[Samanda\u011f\u0131]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history===\n[[File:Slave treaty tablet.jpg|thumb|220px|Fugitive slave treaty between Idrimi of [[Alalakh]] (now [[Tell Atchana]]) and Pillia of [[Kizzuwatna]] ''(now Cilicia),'' (c. 1480 BC) Ref:{{British-Museum-db|131447|id=327265}}.]]\nCilicia was settled from the Neolithic period onwards.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Akpinar|first=Ezgi|date=September 2004|publication-place=Ankara|title=Hellenistic & Roman Settlement Patterns in the Plain of Issus & the Amanus Range|type=Master of Arts Thesis |chapter=The Natural Landscape - Hydrology|publisher=[[Bilkent University]]|page=12 |url=http://www.thesis.bilkent.edu.tr/0002770.pdf|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref><ref name=mellink>Mellink, M.J. 1991.''

The Cilician cities unknown to Homer already bore their pre-Greek names: [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarzu (Tarsus)]], Ingira ([[Anchiale]]), [[Adana|Danuna-Adana]], which retains its ancient name, Pahri (perhaps [[Mopsuestia]]), Kundu (Kyinda, then [[Anazarbus]]) and [[Karatepe|Azatiwataya]] (today's [[Karatepe]]).<ref>Fox 2008:75 notes these city names.</ref>\n\nThere exists evidence that circa 1650 BC both Hittite kings [[Hattusili I]] and [[Mursili I]] enjoyed freedom of movement along the [[Pyramus River]] (now the Ceyhan River in southern [[Turkey]]), proving they exerted strong control over Cilicia in their battles with [[Syria]]. After the death of Murshili around 1595 BC, [[Hurrians]] wrested control from the Hitties, and Cilicia was free for two centuries. The first king of free Cilicia, [[Isputahsu|I\u0161putah\u0161u]], son of [[Pariyawatri]], was recorded as a \"great king\" in both [[cuneiform]] and [[Hittite hieroglyphs]]. Another record of Hittite origins, a treaty between I\u0161putah\u0161u and [[Telipinu]], king of the Hittites, is recorded in both Hittite and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hallo|first=William W.|title=The Ancient Near East: A History|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1971|location=New York|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\nIn the next century, Cilician king [[Pilliya]] finalized treaties with both King [[Zidanta II]] of the Hittites and [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]], in which Idrimi mentions that he had assaulted several military targets throughout Eastern Cilicia. [[Niqmepa]], who succeeded Idrimi as king of Alalakh, went so far as to ask for help from a Hurrian rival, [[Shaushtatar]] of [[Mitanni]], to try and reduce Cilicia's power in the region. It was soon apparent, however, that increased Hittite power would soon prove Niqmepa's efforts to be futile, as the city of [[Kizzuwatna]] soon fell to the Hittites, threatening all of Cilicia. Soon after, King [[Sunassura II]] was forced to accept [[vassal]]ization under the Hittites, becoming the last king of ancient Cilicia.<ref>Hallo, p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century BC a major population shift occurred as the [[Sea Peoples]] overran Cilicia.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The Hurrians that resided there deserted the area and moved northeast towards the [[Taurus Mountains]], where they settled in the area of [[Cappadocia]].<ref>Hallo, pp. 119\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of Muk\u0161u\u0161, whom the Greeks rendered [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\"/> and credited as the founder of Mopsuestia,<ref name=\"CAH-364\"/> though the capital was Adana. Mopsuestia's multicultural character is reflected in the bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries, written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].\n\nIn the ninth century BC it became part of [[Assyria]] and remained so until the late seventh century BC.\n\n===Kingdom of Cilicia===\n{{main|Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)}} \nCilicians could manage to protect themselves from Assyrian domination and with the dissolution of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 612BC, they had established their fully independent kingdom. As being at a geography that is strategically significant, Cilicians could manage to expand their kingdom as north as [[K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River|Halys River]] in a short period. With the expansions, Cilician Kingdom became as strong as [[Babylonia]], one of the powerhouses of the time.\n\nIn 585BC, [[Herodotus]] praised Cilician king [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]], the founder of the kingdom, for his efforts in leading negotiations in ending the 5 years' war between [[Lydia]] and [[Medes|Median Kingdom]].\n\n<blockquote>War broke out between the two countries and continued for five years, during which both the Lydians and Medes won a number of victories. On one occasion they had an unexpected battle in the dark, an event which occurred after five years of indecisive warfare. The two armies had already engaged and the fight was in progress, when the day was suddenly turned into night. [...] Both Lydians and Medes broke off the engagement when they saw this darkening of the day; they were more anxious than they had been to conclude peace, and a reconciliation was brought about by Syennesis, a Cilician, and Labynetus of Babylon, who were the men responsible both for the pact to keep the peace and for the exchange of marriages between the two kingdoms. They persuaded Alyattes to give his daughter Aryenis to Astyages, son of Cyaxares - knowing that treaties seldom remain intact without powerful sanctions.{{sfn|Heredotus|Histories|page=1.74.}}</blockquote>\n\nPeaceful governance conducted by the Syennesis dynasty, not only kept the kingdom survive, also prevented Achaemenid Empire to attacks Lydians, after Achaemenid invasions of Median lands. Appua\u0161u, the son of Syennessis, defended the country against the Babylonian king [[Neriglissar]] campaign, whose army reached Cilicia and crossed the Taurus mountain range. Achaemenids could manage to defeat Lydians, thus Appua\u0161u had to recognize the authority of the Persians in 549BBC to keep the local administration with the Cilicians.

In 401, Syennesis III and his wife Epyaxa supported the revolt of Cyrus the Younger against his brother Artaxerxes II Mnemon. This was sound policy, because otherwise, Cilicia would have been looted by the rebel army. However, after the defeat of Cyrus at Cunaxa, Syennesis' position was difficult. Most scholars assume that this behavior marked the end of the independence of Cilicia.

On its long rough descent from the Anatolian plateau to Tarsus, it ran through the narrow pass between walls of rock called the [[Cilician Gates]]. After crossing the low hills east of the Pyramus it passed through a masonry (Cilician) gate, Demir Kapu, and entered the plain of Issus. From that plain one road ran southward through another masonry (Syrian) gate to [[Alexandretta]], and thence crossed Mt. Amanus by the Syrian Gate, Beilan Pass, eventually to Antioch and Syria. Another road ran northwards through a masonry (Armenian) gate, south of Toprak Kale, and crossed Mt. Amanus by the Armenian Gate, Baghche Pass, to northern Syria and the Euphrates. By the last pass, which was apparently unknown to Alexander, Darius crossed the mountains prior to the [[battle of Issus]]. Both passes are short and easy and connect Cilicia Pedias geographically and politically with Syria rather than with Anatolia.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n====Satrapy of the Empire of Alexander====\n[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] forded the [[Halys River]] in the summer of 333 BC, ending up on the border of southeastern [[Phrygia]] and Cilicia. He knew well the writings of [[Xenophon]], and how the Cilician Gates had been \"impassable if obstructed by the enemy\". Alexander reasoned that by force alone he could frighten the defenders and break through, and he gathered his men to do so. In the cover of night they attacked, startling the guards and sending them and their satrap into full flight, setting their crops aflame as they made for [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]. This good fortune allowed Alexander and his army to pass unharmed through the Gates and into Cilicia.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=Alexander the Great|publisher=The Dial Press|year=1974|pages=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nAfter Alexander's death it was long a battleground of rival [[Hellenistic]] monarchs and kingdoms, and for a time fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] dominion (i.e., Egypt), but finally came to the [[Seleucids]], who, however, never held effectually more than the eastern half.<ref name=EB1911/> During the [[Hellenistic]] era, numerous cities were established in Cilicia, which minted coins showing the badges (gods, animals and objects) associated with each polis.<ref>For a full list of ancient cities and their coins see asiaminorcoins.com - [http://www.asiaminorcoins.com/gallery/index.php?cat=21 ancient coins of Cilicia]</ref>\n\n=== Roman/Byzantine Cilicia ===\n{{main|Cilicia (Roman province)|Cibyrrhaeot Theme}} \n[[File:Asia Minor in the 2nd century AD - general map - Roman provinces under Trajan - bleached - English legend.jpg|thumb|300px|The Roman provinces of Asia Minor under Trajan, including Cilicia.]]\n[[File:Anazarbus klikya city south gate.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Roman-period triumphal arch at [[Anazarbus]], later converted into the city's south gate]]\n'''Cilicia Trachea''' became the haunt of [[Cilician pirates|pirates]], who were subdued by [[Pompey]] in 67 BC following a [[Battle of Korakesion]] (modern [[Alanya]]), and Tarsus was made the capital of the [[Roman province]] of Cilicia.

With the improvements in agriculture and the spike of agricultural yield, agriculture-based industries are built in large numbers. Today, the manufacturing industry is mainly concentrated around [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], [[Adana]] and [[Ceyhan]]. Textile, leather tanning and food processing plants are plentiful. \u0130sdemir is a large steel plant located in [[\u0130skenderun]]. \n\nThe [[petrochemical industry]] is rapidly developing in the region with the investments around the Ceyhan Oil Terminal. Petroleum refineries are being built in the area. [[Ceyhan]] is also expected to host the shipbuilding industry.\n\n===Commerce===\n[[Adana]] is the commercial center of the region where many of the public and private institutions have their regional offices. [[Mersin]] and [[Antakya]] are also home to regional offices of public institutions. Many industry fairs and congresses are held in the region at venues such as the T\u00dcYAP Congress and Exhibition Center in [[Adana]] and the Mersin Congress Center.\n\n'''Mersin Seaport''' is the third largest seaport in Turkey, after [[\u0130stanbul]] and [[\u0130zmir]].

This area is zoned for resort tourism and is expected to have a rapid development within the next 20 years.  [[Karata\u015f]] and [[Yumurtal\u0131k]] coasts are home to cottages with a bird conservatory between the two areas.  Arsuz is a seaside resort that is mostly frequented by [[Antakya]] and [[\u0130skenderun]] residents.\n\nPlateaus on the Taurus mountains are cooler escapes for the locals who wants to chill out from hot and humid summers of the lower plains.

There are a few hotels and camping sites in the Tekir plateau.\n\nLying at a crossroads of three major religions, namely [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], the region is home to numerous landmarks that are important for people of faith. Tarsus is the birthplace of [[St. Paul]], who returned to the city after his conversion. The city was a stronghold of Christians after his death. Ashab-\u0131 Kehf cavern, one of the locations claimed to be the resting place of the legendary [[Seven Sleepers]], holy to Christians and Muslims, is located north of Tarsus. [[Antakya]] is another destination for the spiritual world, where the followers of [[Jesus Christ]] were first called Christians.

The major reason is the mountainous geography of Hatay as well as the religiously and ethnically diverse culture. Hatay joined Turkey in 1939, thus did not face the population exchanges of the 1920. The province has many villages inhabited by Christians as well as the only remaining ethnic [[Armenians|Armenian]] village of Turkey, [[Vak\u0131fl\u0131, Samanda\u011f|Vak\u0131fl\u0131]]. [[Adana Province]] is the most urbanized province, with most of the population centered in the city of [[Adana]]. [[Mersin Province]] has a larger rural population than [[Adana Province]], owing to its long and narrow stretch of flat land in between the [[Taurus Mountains]] and the Mediterranean.\n\n===Urban areas===\nSettlements are well spread to all parts of Cilicia.

[[Adana \u015eakirpa\u015fa Airport]] is an international airport that have flights to European destinations. There are daily domestic flights to [[\u0130stanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[\u0130zmir]], [[Antalya]] and [[Trabzon]]. [[Adana \u015eakirpa\u015fa Airport]] serves the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]] and [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]].\n\n[[Image:Rail transport map of Turkey.png|upright=1.3|thumb|Railway connections of Cilicia]]\n[[Hatay Airport]], opened in 2007, is a domestic airport, and currently has flights to [[\u0130stanbul]], [[Ankara]] and [[Nicosia]], [[Northern Cyprus|TRNC]]. Hatay Airport mostly serves [[Hatay Province]].\n\nAnother underconstruction airport is [[\u00c7ukurova Regional Airport]], According to the newspaper [[H\u00fcrriyet]], the project's cost will be 357 million Euro. When finished, it will serve to 15 million people, and the capacity will be doubled in the future.\n\n===Sea===\nThere are daily seabus and vehicle-passenger ferry services from [[Ta\u015fucu]] to [[Kyrenia]], [[Northern Cyprus]]. From [[Mersin]] port, there are ferry services to [[Famagusta]].\n\n===Road===\nThe [[List of highways in Turkey#Motorways|O50 - O59]] motorways crosses Cilicia. Motorways of Cilicia extends to [[Ni\u011fde]] on the north, [[Erdemli]] on the west and [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]] on the east, and [[\u0130skenderun]] on the south. [[State road D400 (Turkey)|State road D-400]] connects Cilicia to Antalya on the west. [[Adana]]&ndash;[[Kozan, Adana|Kozan]], [[Adana]]&ndash;[[Karata\u015f]], [[\u0130skenderun]]&ndash;[[Antakya]]&ndash;[[Aleppo]] double roads are other regional roads.\n\n===Railway===\nParallel to the highway network in Cilicia, there is an extensive railway network. Adana-Mersin train runs as a commuter train between Mersin, Tarsus and Adana. There are also regional trains from Adana to Ceyhan, Osmaniye and \u0130skenderun.\n\n==Society==\nCilicia was one of the most important regions for the Ottoman Armenians because it managed very well to preserve Armenian character throughout the years. In fact, the Cilician highlands were densely populated by Armenian peasants in small but prosperous towns and villages such as [[Hadjin]] and [[S\u00fcleymanl\u0131|Zeitun]], two mountainous areas where autonomy was maintained until the 19th century.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\">Bournoutian, Ani Atamian. \"Cilician Armenia\" in ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century''.

Their population was continuously increasing in numbers in Cilicia in contrast to other parts of the Ottoman Empire, where it was, since 1878, decreasing due to repression.\n\n== Mythological namesake ==\n[[Greek mythology]] mentions another '''Cilicia''', as a small region situated immediately southeast of the [[Troad]] in northwestern Anatolia, facing the Gulf of [[Adramyttium]]. The connection (if any) between this Cilicia and the better-known and well-defined region mentioned above is unclear. This Trojan Cilicia is mentioned in [[Homer]]'s ''Iliad'' and [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'', and contained localities such as [[Cilician Thebe|Thebe]], [[Lyrnessus]] and Chryse (home to [[Chryses]] and Chryseis). These three cities were all attacked and sacked by [[Achilles]] during the [[Trojan War]].\n\nIn ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (v 353), [[Aeschylus]] mentions the Cilician caves (probably [[Cennet and Cehennem]]), where the earth-born, hundred-headed monster [[Typhon]] dwelt before he withstood the gods and was stricken and charred by [[Zeus]]'s thunderbolt.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ancient regions of Anatolia]]\n* [[Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]]\n* [[Catholicos of Cilicia]]\n* [[Notitia dignitatum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Pilhofer, Philipp. 2018.

It is at the south-center of the modern [[Turkey]] and known locally as [[\u00c7ukurova]].\n\nCilicia has been a crossroad for cultures, religions and ethnicities throughout the history. Anatolian civilizations, Romans, Greeks, Armenians, Arabs and Turks resided and built civilizations at the region.\nCilicia existed as a political entity from the [[Hittites|Hittite]] era until the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], during the late [[Byzantine Empire]]. The region was continued to be called Cilicia internationally, during the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]. After World War I, Cilicia again appeared as a political entity during the three years' of French rule. The name was unused after the foundation of the Turkish Republic, together with other regional names like [[Cappadocia]] and [[Lycia]]. It is getting attention in the last decades, as Cilicia has now been used in many brand names in the [[Adana Province|Adana]] and [[Mersin Province|Mersin]] provinces.\n\n==Geography and etymology==\nCilicia extended along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast east from [[Pamphylia]], to the [[Nur Mountains]], which separated it from [[Syria]]. North and east of Cilicia lie the rugged [[Taurus Mountains]] that separate it from the high central plateau of Anatolia, which are pierced by a narrow gorge, called in antiquity the [[Cilician Gates]].<ref>Ramsay, William Mitchell (1908) ''The Cities of St. Paul Their Influence on His Life and Thought: The cities of Eastern Asia Minor'' A.C.

The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus \u00c7ay), the Sarus ([[Seyhan River|Seyhan]]) and the Pyramus ([[Ceyhan River]]), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, and that the united rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, [[Adana]] (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.<ref name=EB1911/>\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Cilicia shows significant differences at the mountains and the lower plains. At the lower plains, the climate reflects a typical [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]; summers are hot and dry, winters are warm and rainy. In the coldest month (January), the average temperature is 9&nbsp;\u00b0C, and in the warmest month (August), the average temperature is 28&nbsp;\u00b0C. Mountains of Cilicia have an inland climate with snowy winters. The average annual precipitation in the region is 647mm and the average number of rainy days in a year is 76. [[Mersin]] and surrounding areas have the highest average temperature in Cilicia. Mersin also has a high annual precipitation (1096mm) and 85 rainy days in a year.\n\n===Geology===\nThe Mountains of Cilicia are formed from ancient limestones, [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], marlstone and similar materials. The lower plain is the largest [[alluvial plain]] in Turkey. Expansion of limestone formations and fourth era alluvials brought by the rivers [[Seyhan River|Seyhan]] and [[Ceyhan River|Ceyhan]], formed the plains of the region over the course of time.\n\n[[Akyatan Lagoon|Akyatan]], Akyayan, Salt Lake, Seven lakes at Alada\u011f, and Karstik Dipsiz lake near [[Karaisal\u0131]] are the lakes of the region. The reservoirs in the region are Seyhan, \u00c7atalan, Yedig\u00f6ze, Kozan and Mehmetli.\n\nThe major rivers in Cilicia are [[Seyhan River|Seyhan]], [[Ceyhan River|Ceyhan]], [[Berdan River|Berdan (Tarsus)]], [[Orontes River|Asi]] and [[G\u00f6ksu]].\n\n*[[Seyhan River]] emerges from the confluence of Zamant\u0131 and G\u00f6ksu rivers which originate from [[Kayseri Province]] and flows into the Gulf of Mersin. The river is 560&nbsp;km long.\n*[[Ceyhan River]] emerges from the confluence of Aksu and Hurman rivers and flows into Cape H\u00fcrm\u00fcz at the [[Gulf of \u0130skenderun]]. It is 509&nbsp;km long and it forms the Akyayan, Akyatan and Kakarat lakes before flowing into the Mediterranean.\n*[[Berdan River]] originates from the [[Taurus Mountains]] and flows into the Mediterranean, south of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]].\n*[[G\u00f6ksu]] river originates from the [[Taurus Mountains]] and flows into the Mediterranean, 16&nbsp;km southeast of [[Silifke]].

The region was divided into two parts, Uru Adaniya (flat Cilicia), a well-watered plain, and \"rough\" Cilicia (Tarza), in the mountainous west.\n\nThe Cilicians appear as ''Hilikku'' in Assyrian inscriptions, and in the early part of the first millennium BC were one of the four chief powers of [[Western Asia]].<ref name=EB1911/> [[Homer]] mentions [[\u00c7ukurova|the plain]] as the \"Aleian plain\" in which [[Bellerophon]] wandered,<ref>''Iliad'' 6.201.</ref> but he transferred the Cilicians far to the west and north and made them allies of Troy. The Cilician cities unknown to Homer already bore their pre-Greek names: [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarzu (Tarsus)]], Ingira ([[Anchiale]]), [[Adana|Danuna-Adana]], which retains its ancient name, Pahri (perhaps [[Mopsuestia]]), Kundu (Kyinda, then [[Anazarbus]]) and [[Karatepe|Azatiwataya]] (today's [[Karatepe]]).<ref>Fox 2008:75 notes these city names.</ref>\n\nThere exists evidence that circa 1650 BC both Hittite kings [[Hattusili I]] and [[Mursili I]] enjoyed freedom of movement along the [[Pyramus River]] (now the Ceyhan River in southern [[Turkey]]), proving they exerted strong control over Cilicia in their battles with [[Syria]]. After the death of Murshili around 1595 BC, [[Hurrians]] wrested control from the Hitties, and Cilicia was free for two centuries. The first king of free Cilicia, [[Isputahsu|I\u0161putah\u0161u]], son of [[Pariyawatri]], was recorded as a \"great king\" in both [[cuneiform]] and [[Hittite hieroglyphs]]. Another record of Hittite origins, a treaty between I\u0161putah\u0161u and [[Telipinu]], king of the Hittites, is recorded in both Hittite and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hallo|first=William W.|title=The Ancient Near East: A History|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1971|location=New York|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\nIn the next century, Cilician king [[Pilliya]] finalized treaties with both King [[Zidanta II]] of the Hittites and [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]], in which Idrimi mentions that he had assaulted several military targets throughout Eastern Cilicia. [[Niqmepa]], who succeeded Idrimi as king of Alalakh, went so far as to ask for help from a Hurrian rival, [[Shaushtatar]] of [[Mitanni]], to try and reduce Cilicia's power in the region. It was soon apparent, however, that increased Hittite power would soon prove Niqmepa's efforts to be futile, as the city of [[Kizzuwatna]] soon fell to the Hittites, threatening all of Cilicia. Soon after, King [[Sunassura II]] was forced to accept [[vassal]]ization under the Hittites, becoming the last king of ancient Cilicia.<ref>Hallo, p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century BC a major population shift occurred as the [[Sea Peoples]] overran Cilicia.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The Hurrians that resided there deserted the area and moved northeast towards the [[Taurus Mountains]], where they settled in the area of [[Cappadocia]].<ref>Hallo, pp. 119\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of Muk\u0161u\u0161, whom the Greeks rendered [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\"/> and credited as the founder of Mopsuestia,<ref name=\"CAH-364\"/> though the capital was Adana. Mopsuestia's multicultural character is reflected in the bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries, written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].\n\nIn the ninth century BC it became part of [[Assyria]] and remained so until the late seventh century BC.\n\n===Kingdom of Cilicia===\n{{main|Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)}} \nCilicians could manage to protect themselves from Assyrian domination and with the dissolution of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 612BC, they had established their fully independent kingdom. As being at a geography that is strategically significant, Cilicians could manage to expand their kingdom as north as [[K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River|Halys River]] in a short period. With the expansions, Cilician Kingdom became as strong as [[Babylonia]], one of the powerhouses of the time.\n\nIn 585BC, [[Herodotus]] praised Cilician king [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]], the founder of the kingdom, for his efforts in leading negotiations in ending the 5 years' war between [[Lydia]] and [[Medes|Median Kingdom]].\n\n<blockquote>War broke out between the two countries and continued for five years, during which both the Lydians and Medes won a number of victories. On one occasion they had an unexpected battle in the dark, an event which occurred after five years of indecisive warfare. The two armies had already engaged and the fight was in progress, when the day was suddenly turned into night. [...] Both Lydians and Medes broke off the engagement when they saw this darkening of the day; they were more anxious than they had been to conclude peace, and a reconciliation was brought about by Syennesis, a Cilician, and Labynetus of Babylon, who were the men responsible both for the pact to keep the peace and for the exchange of marriages between the two kingdoms. They persuaded Alyattes to give his daughter Aryenis to Astyages, son of Cyaxares - knowing that treaties seldom remain intact without powerful sanctions.{{sfn|Heredotus|Histories|page=1.74.}}</blockquote>\n\nPeaceful governance conducted by the Syennesis dynasty, not only kept the kingdom survive, also prevented Achaemenid Empire to attacks Lydians, after Achaemenid invasions of Median lands. Appua\u0161u, the son of Syennessis, defended the country against the Babylonian king [[Neriglissar]] campaign, whose army reached Cilicia and crossed the Taurus mountain range. Achaemenids could manage to defeat Lydians, thus Appua\u0161u had to recognize the authority of the Persians in 549BBC to keep the local administration with the Cilicians.

In 401, Syennesis III and his wife Epyaxa supported the revolt of Cyrus the Younger against his brother Artaxerxes II Mnemon. This was sound policy, because otherwise, Cilicia would have been looted by the rebel army. However, after the defeat of Cyrus at Cunaxa, Syennesis' position was difficult. Most scholars assume that this behavior marked the end of the independence of Cilicia.

On its long rough descent from the Anatolian plateau to Tarsus, it ran through the narrow pass between walls of rock called the [[Cilician Gates]]. After crossing the low hills east of the Pyramus it passed through a masonry (Cilician) gate, Demir Kapu, and entered the plain of Issus. From that plain one road ran southward through another masonry (Syrian) gate to [[Alexandretta]], and thence crossed Mt. Amanus by the Syrian Gate, Beilan Pass, eventually to Antioch and Syria. Another road ran northwards through a masonry (Armenian) gate, south of Toprak Kale, and crossed Mt. Amanus by the Armenian Gate, Baghche Pass, to northern Syria and the Euphrates. By the last pass, which was apparently unknown to Alexander, Darius crossed the mountains prior to the [[battle of Issus]]. Both passes are short and easy and connect Cilicia Pedias geographically and politically with Syria rather than with Anatolia.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n====Satrapy of the Empire of Alexander====\n[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] forded the [[Halys River]] in the summer of 333 BC, ending up on the border of southeastern [[Phrygia]] and Cilicia. He knew well the writings of [[Xenophon]], and how the Cilician Gates had been \"impassable if obstructed by the enemy\". Alexander reasoned that by force alone he could frighten the defenders and break through, and he gathered his men to do so. In the cover of night they attacked, startling the guards and sending them and their satrap into full flight, setting their crops aflame as they made for [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]. This good fortune allowed Alexander and his army to pass unharmed through the Gates and into Cilicia.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=Alexander the Great|publisher=The Dial Press|year=1974|pages=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nAfter Alexander's death it was long a battleground of rival [[Hellenistic]] monarchs and kingdoms, and for a time fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] dominion (i.e., Egypt), but finally came to the [[Seleucids]], who, however, never held effectually more than the eastern half.<ref name=EB1911/> During the [[Hellenistic]] era, numerous cities were established in Cilicia, which minted coins showing the badges (gods, animals and objects) associated with each polis.<ref>For a full list of ancient cities and their coins see asiaminorcoins.com - [http://www.asiaminorcoins.com/gallery/index.php?cat=21 ancient coins of Cilicia]</ref>\n\n=== Roman/Byzantine Cilicia ===\n{{main|Cilicia (Roman province)|Cibyrrhaeot Theme}} \n[[File:Asia Minor in the 2nd century AD - general map - Roman provinces under Trajan - bleached - English legend.jpg|thumb|300px|The Roman provinces of Asia Minor under Trajan, including Cilicia.]]\n[[File:Anazarbus klikya city south gate.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Roman-period triumphal arch at [[Anazarbus]], later converted into the city's south gate]]\n'''Cilicia Trachea''' became the haunt of [[Cilician pirates|pirates]], who were subdued by [[Pompey]] in 67 BC following a [[Battle of Korakesion]] (modern [[Alanya]]), and Tarsus was made the capital of the [[Roman province]] of Cilicia.

The Ramadanids played an important role in 15th century [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-[[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] relations, being a [[buffer state]] located in the Mamluk ''[[al-'Awasim]]'' frontier zone.

There are a small number of hotels between [[Erdemli]] and [[Anamur]] that attracts tourists. Cilicia tourism is mostly cottage tourism serving the Cilicia locals as well as residents of [[Kayseri]], [[Gaziantep]] and surrounding areas. Between [[Silifke]] and [[Mersin]], high-rise and low-rise cottages line the coast, leaving almost no vacant land.  The coastline from [[Mersin]] to [[Karata\u015f]] is mostly farmland. This area is zoned for resort tourism and is expected to have a rapid development within the next 20 years.  [[Karata\u015f]] and [[Yumurtal\u0131k]] coasts are home to cottages with a bird conservatory between the two areas.  Arsuz is a seaside resort that is mostly frequented by [[Antakya]] and [[\u0130skenderun]] residents.\n\nPlateaus on the Taurus mountains are cooler escapes for the locals who wants to chill out from hot and humid summers of the lower plains.

There are a few hotels and camping sites in the Tekir plateau.\n\nLying at a crossroads of three major religions, namely [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], the region is home to numerous landmarks that are important for people of faith. Tarsus is the birthplace of [[St. Paul]], who returned to the city after his conversion. The city was a stronghold of Christians after his death. Ashab-\u0131 Kehf cavern, one of the locations claimed to be the resting place of the legendary [[Seven Sleepers]], holy to Christians and Muslims, is located north of Tarsus.

[[Adana \u015eakirpa\u015fa Airport]] serves the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]] and [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]].\n\n[[Image:Rail transport map of Turkey.png|upright=1.3|thumb|Railway connections of Cilicia]]\n[[Hatay Airport]], opened in 2007, is a domestic airport, and currently has flights to [[\u0130stanbul]], [[Ankara]] and [[Nicosia]], [[Northern Cyprus|TRNC]]. Hatay Airport mostly serves [[Hatay Province]].\n\nAnother underconstruction airport is [[\u00c7ukurova Regional Airport]], According to the newspaper [[H\u00fcrriyet]], the project's cost will be 357 million Euro. When finished, it will serve to 15 million people, and the capacity will be doubled in the future.\n\n===Sea===\nThere are daily seabus and vehicle-passenger ferry services from [[Ta\u015fucu]] to [[Kyrenia]], [[Northern Cyprus]]. From [[Mersin]] port, there are ferry services to [[Famagusta]].\n\n===Road===\nThe [[List of highways in Turkey#Motorways|O50 - O59]] motorways crosses Cilicia. Motorways of Cilicia extends to [[Ni\u011fde]] on the north, [[Erdemli]] on the west and [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]] on the east, and [[\u0130skenderun]] on the south. [[State road D400 (Turkey)|State road D-400]] connects Cilicia to Antalya on the west.

Adana-Mersin train runs as a commuter train between Mersin, Tarsus and Adana. There are also regional trains from Adana to Ceyhan, Osmaniye and \u0130skenderun.\n\n==Society==\nCilicia was one of the most important regions for the Ottoman Armenians because it managed very well to preserve Armenian character throughout the years. In fact, the Cilician highlands were densely populated by Armenian peasants in small but prosperous towns and villages such as [[Hadjin]] and [[S\u00fcleymanl\u0131|Zeitun]], two mountainous areas where autonomy was maintained until the 19th century.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\">Bournoutian, Ani Atamian. \"Cilician Armenia\" in ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century''.

Their population was continuously increasing in numbers in Cilicia in contrast to other parts of the Ottoman Empire, where it was, since 1878, decreasing due to repression.\n\n== Mythological namesake ==\n[[Greek mythology]] mentions another '''Cilicia''', as a small region situated immediately southeast of the [[Troad]] in northwestern Anatolia, facing the Gulf of [[Adramyttium]]. The connection (if any) between this Cilicia and the better-known and well-defined region mentioned above is unclear. This Trojan Cilicia is mentioned in [[Homer]]'s ''Iliad'' and [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'', and contained localities such as [[Cilician Thebe|Thebe]], [[Lyrnessus]] and Chryse (home to [[Chryses]] and Chryseis). These three cities were all attacked and sacked by [[Achilles]] during the [[Trojan War]].\n\nIn ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (v 353), [[Aeschylus]] mentions the Cilician caves (probably [[Cennet and Cehennem]]), where the earth-born, hundred-headed monster [[Typhon]] dwelt before he withstood the gods and was stricken and charred by [[Zeus]]'s thunderbolt.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ancient regions of Anatolia]]\n* [[Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]]\n* [[Catholicos of Cilicia]]\n* [[Notitia dignitatum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Pilhofer, Philipp. 2018.

Retrieved 1 August 2013</ref>\n\n==History==\n===18th\u201319th centuries===\n[[File:Valentine Morris.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Valentine Morris circa 1765]]\nRecords since the 14th century refer variously to Peerfield, Peersfield, Persfield and Piersfield, the area taking its name, according to some sources, from the nearby [[manor]] of [[St. Pierre, Monmouthshire|St. Pierre]]. The land was owned by the influential Walter family from [[medieval]] times until the 18th century. Local historians report an enlargement of the existing house under John Walter in the 1630s, and a later extension around 1700 is believed to have been the work of the architect [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], also responsible for [[Chatsworth House]].\n\nIn 1727, the estate was sold for \u00a33,366, 5.6d to Thomas Rous of [[Wotton-under-Edge]]. His son then sold it again in 1740, for \u00a38,250, to Colonel Valentine Morris. Morris (c 1678\u20131743) was born in [[Antigua]], the son of a [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar planter]] and merchant, and is thought to have been descended from the Walter family. The estate was then inherited by his son, also [[Valentine Morris]] (1727\u20131789), who began living at Piercefield with his family in 1753. At this time, tourism in the [[Wye Valley]] was in its infancy. Morris landscaped the parkland, with the help of [[Richard Owen Cambridge]] in the style of [[Capability Brown]].{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}}  The work was largely undertaken by architect Charles Howells and builder William Knowles of Chepstow, who had also undertaken work at nearby [[Tintern]] for the [[Charles Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort|Duke of Beaufort]].<ref name=waters>Ivor Waters, ''The Unfortunate Valentine Morris'', 1964</ref> Piercefield was developed into a park of national reputation, as one of the earliest examples of [[picturesque]] landscaping. Morris laid out walks through the woodland, and included a grotto, druid's temple, bathing house and giant's cave. He also developed viewpoints along the clifftop above the [[River Wye]], and opened the park up to visitors. One of the many tourists to marvel at this view was the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], who wrote: \"Oh what a godly scene....The whole world seemed imaged in its vast circumference\".  The scientist and traveller [[Joseph Banks]] wrote: \"I am more and more convinced that it is far the most beautiful place I ever saw\".<ref name=waters/>\n\nIn the 1770s Valentine Morris's gambling, business and political dealings bankrupted him, and he was forced to leave Piercefield for the [[West Indies]]. In 1785, Piercefield was sold again, for \u00a326,200, to George Smith, a [[Durham, England|Durham]] banker, father of the linguist [[Elizabeth Smith (translator)|Elizabeth]]. Smith continued to open the walks, but straightened some of them.{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}} He also commissioned a young architect, [[Sir John Soane|John Soane]] to design a new mansion in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style, which would incorporate Morris's house.{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}}  Work began in 1792, and the new three-storey stone building had reached roof level when Smith found himself in financial difficulties. He sold Piercefield in 1794 to Colonel [[Sir Mark Wood, 1st Baronet|Mark Wood]], [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Newark-on-Trent]], who continued and modified the work with architect [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder|Joseph Bonomi]],{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}} incorporating a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[portico]] and wings, and commissioning the long stone wall which runs along the edge of the estate. Wood was also the owner of [[Llanthony Priory]]. In 1802, Wood in turn sold the house and estate to the [[mixed race]] planter [[Nathaniel Wells]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/slavery_nathanielwells.shtml|title=South East Wales \u2013 BBC News|website=BBC News}}</ref> for \u00a390,000 cash. Wells was born in [[St. Kitts]], the son of William Wells, a sugar merchant and planter originally from [[Cardiff]], and Juggy, one of his house slaves. With his inherited fortune, Wells continued to add to the Piercefield estate until it reached almost 3,000 acres (12&nbsp;km\u00b2). In 1818 he became Britain's only known black sheriff when he was appointed [[Sheriff of Monmouthshire]].\n\nIt is rumoured that [[Admiral Nelson]] spent a night at Piercefield House on one of his visits to [[Monmouthshire]]. Nelson was closely connected to the town of Monmouth through his mistress [[Lady Hamilton]]. It is possible that he stayed in the summer of 1802 with her and her elderly husband [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], on a journey to a friend's Pembrokeshire estate via [[Monmouth]] and [[Kymin Hill]].\n[[File:Piercefield House 1840.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Piercefield House circa 1840 from a painting by George Eyre Brooks]]\n\nIn 1848, [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis's]] ''Topographical Dictionary of England'' described Piercefield in the following terms: <blockquote>From Piercefield Park, a splendid seat, the views are remarkably magnificent, and embrace numerous reaches of the Wye, the Severn, and a great range of the surrounding country. The mansion, situated on an eminence, in the midst of fine plantations, is a superb elevation of freestone, consisting of a centre and two wings, and much admired for its tasteful architecture: on the spacious staircase are four beautiful pieces of [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelin tapestry]] which belonged to [[Louis XVI]], representing subjects in the natural history of Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50761&strquery=kingsmark#s1|title=Arvans, St \u2013 Ashburton \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWells left the area in the 1840s and his tenants closed the walks to the public. In the late 1840s the estate was leased to [[John Russell (collier)|John Russell]] (1788\u20131873) the Coal and Ironmaster, (High Sheriff of Monmouthshire 1855), who owned the neighbouring estate of [[Wyelands]]. In 1855 following the death of  Nathaniel Wells, Russell purchased the estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Gwent/BlackVein.htm|title=Black Vein Colliery, Risca|website=www.welshcoalmines.co.uk}}</ref> The walks were occasionally reopened to the public, but for a charge. Around this time suggestions were made in the national press that the estate would be a suitable residence for the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]].<ref name=waters/> However, following the explosion at his [[Risca]] Blackvein Colliery, Russell sold the estate in 1861 to Henry Clay, a banker and brewer from [[Burton-on-Trent]]. In 1874 the estate passed to Clay's eldest son, also Henry Clay, who lived there until his death in 1921 aged 96.\n\n===20th century===\nThe Clay family sold the house and much of the estate on the death of Henry Clay to the [[Chepstow Racecourse|Chepstow Racecourse Company]] (of which the Directors were all members of the Clay family), who opened the new racecourse there in 1926. The house, already in a poor state of repair, was abandoned and stripped, gradually decaying to its current ruinous condition, with just the main walls still standing.  The woods overlooking the river became established as a [[nature reserve]], and footpaths which now form part of the [[Wye Valley Walk]] were reopened in the 1970s. Plans to develop the site as a hotel or outdoor pursuits centre have so far been unfulfilled, with emergency repairs to the house carried out in 2008\u201309.<ref>[http://www.davies-sutton.co.uk/#!__projects/vstc5=conservation Davies Sutton Architects].

The house sits within Piercefield Park, a Grade I listed historic landscape, that was created in the 18th century as a notable [[Picturesque]] estate.\n\nThe house is now a shell, along with its extensive stable block, but its status as a [[Grade II* listed building]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-2013-ruins-of-piercefield-house-central-block-s|title=Ruins of Piercefield House (Central Block), St. Arvans, Monmouthshire|first=Good|last=Stuff|website=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk}}</ref> reflects its importance.

The land was owned by the influential Walter family from [[medieval]] times until the 18th century. Local historians report an enlargement of the existing house under John Walter in the 1630s, and a later extension around 1700 is believed to have been the work of the architect [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], also responsible for [[Chatsworth House]].\n\nIn 1727, the estate was sold for \u00a33,366, 5.6d to Thomas Rous of [[Wotton-under-Edge]]. His son then sold it again in 1740, for \u00a38,250, to Colonel Valentine Morris. Morris (c 1678\u20131743) was born in [[Antigua]], the son of a [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar planter]] and merchant, and is thought to have been descended from the Walter family. The estate was then inherited by his son, also [[Valentine Morris]] (1727\u20131789), who began living at Piercefield with his family in 1753. At this time, tourism in the [[Wye Valley]] was in its infancy. Morris landscaped the parkland, with the help of [[Richard Owen Cambridge]] in the style of [[Capability Brown]].{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}}  The work was largely undertaken by architect Charles Howells and builder William Knowles of Chepstow, who had also undertaken work at nearby [[Tintern]] for the [[Charles Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort|Duke of Beaufort]].<ref name=waters>Ivor Waters, ''The Unfortunate Valentine Morris'', 1964</ref> Piercefield was developed into a park of national reputation, as one of the earliest examples of [[picturesque]] landscaping. Morris laid out walks through the woodland, and included a grotto, druid's temple, bathing house and giant's cave. He also developed viewpoints along the clifftop above the [[River Wye]], and opened the park up to visitors. One of the many tourists to marvel at this view was the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], who wrote: \"Oh what a godly scene....The whole world seemed imaged in its vast circumference\".  The scientist and traveller [[Joseph Banks]] wrote: \"I am more and more convinced that it is far the most beautiful place I ever saw\".<ref name=waters/>\n\nIn the 1770s Valentine Morris's gambling, business and political dealings bankrupted him, and he was forced to leave Piercefield for the [[West Indies]]. In 1785, Piercefield was sold again, for \u00a326,200, to George Smith, a [[Durham, England|Durham]] banker, father of the linguist [[Elizabeth Smith (translator)|Elizabeth]]. Smith continued to open the walks, but straightened some of them.{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}} He also commissioned a young architect, [[Sir John Soane|John Soane]] to design a new mansion in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] style, which would incorporate Morris's house.{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}}  Work began in 1792, and the new three-storey stone building had reached roof level when Smith found himself in financial difficulties. He sold Piercefield in 1794 to Colonel [[Sir Mark Wood, 1st Baronet|Mark Wood]], [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Newark-on-Trent]], who continued and modified the work with architect [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder|Joseph Bonomi]],{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=471}} incorporating a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[portico]] and wings, and commissioning the long stone wall which runs along the edge of the estate. Wood was also the owner of [[Llanthony Priory]]. In 1802, Wood in turn sold the house and estate to the [[mixed race]] planter [[Nathaniel Wells]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/slavery_nathanielwells.shtml|title=South East Wales \u2013 BBC News|website=BBC News}}</ref> for \u00a390,000 cash. Wells was born in [[St. Kitts]], the son of William Wells, a sugar merchant and planter originally from [[Cardiff]], and Juggy, one of his house slaves. With his inherited fortune, Wells continued to add to the Piercefield estate until it reached almost 3,000 acres (12&nbsp;km\u00b2). In 1818 he became Britain's only known black sheriff when he was appointed [[Sheriff of Monmouthshire]].\n\nIt is rumoured that [[Admiral Nelson]] spent a night at Piercefield House on one of his visits to [[Monmouthshire]]. Nelson was closely connected to the town of Monmouth through his mistress [[Lady Hamilton]]. It is possible that he stayed in the summer of 1802 with her and her elderly husband [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], on a journey to a friend's Pembrokeshire estate via [[Monmouth]] and [[Kymin Hill]].\n[[File:Piercefield House 1840.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Piercefield House circa 1840 from a painting by George Eyre Brooks]]\n\nIn 1848, [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis's]] ''Topographical Dictionary of England'' described Piercefield in the following terms: <blockquote>From Piercefield Park, a splendid seat, the views are remarkably magnificent, and embrace numerous reaches of the Wye, the Severn, and a great range of the surrounding country. The mansion, situated on an eminence, in the midst of fine plantations, is a superb elevation of freestone, consisting of a centre and two wings, and much admired for its tasteful architecture: on the spacious staircase are four beautiful pieces of [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelin tapestry]] which belonged to [[Louis XVI]], representing subjects in the natural history of Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50761&strquery=kingsmark#s1|title=Arvans, St \u2013 Ashburton \u2013 British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWells left the area in the 1840s and his tenants closed the walks to the public. In the late 1840s the estate was leased to [[John Russell (collier)|John Russell]] (1788\u20131873, High Sheriff of Monmouthshire 1855), who owned the neighbouring estate of [[Wyelands]]. In 1855 following the death of  Nathaniel Wells, Russell purchased the estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Gwent/BlackVein.htm|title=Black Vein Colliery, Risca|website=www.welshcoalmines.co.uk}}</ref> The walks were occasionally reopened to the public, but for a charge. Around this time suggestions were made in the national press that the estate would be a suitable residence for the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]].<ref name=waters/> However, following the explosion at his [[Risca]] Blackvein Colliery, Russell sold the estate in 1861 to Henry Clay, a banker and brewer from [[Burton-on-Trent]]. In 1874 the estate passed to Clay's eldest son, also Henry Clay, who lived there until his death in 1921 aged 96.\n\n===20th century===\nThe Clay family sold the house and much of the estate on the death of Henry Clay to the [[Chepstow Racecourse|Chepstow Racecourse Company]] (of which the Directors were all members of the Clay family), who opened the new racecourse there in 1926. The house, already in a poor state of repair, was abandoned and stripped, gradually decaying to its current ruinous condition, with just the main walls still standing.  The woods overlooking the river became established as a [[nature reserve]], and footpaths which now form part of the [[Wye Valley Walk]] were reopened in the 1970s. Plans to develop the site as a hotel or outdoor pursuits centre have so far been unfulfilled, with emergency repairs to the house carried out in 2008\u201309.<ref>[http://www.davies-sutton.co.uk/#!__projects/vstc5=conservation Davies Sutton Architects].

He kneels down and his hands hover over a bowl installed in the base of the sculpture. He has a beard and mustache and looks upwards to the sky. The sculpture is a working fountain with water flowing up from the bowl and into the figure's proper left hand. \n\nA plaque nearby is inscribed with:\n\n:Jimilu (American)\n:THE SERVANT OF CHRIST\n:MEEKLY I FIT MY STATUE TO YOUR NEED\n:TILL BY SNECHART (sic) I SHALL ACHIEVE MY\n:MORIAL (sic) PLAN.\n:TO PASS THE LOW INITIAL OF THE HUMAN\n:HEART.\n:FROM IMMANANCE (sic) BY\n:EVALYN UNDERHILL <ref name=\"SOS\">{{Cite web| author=SOS! | year=1993 | title=The Servant Christ (sculpture).  | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!323062~!0#focus | accessdate= 10 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Background about The Servant Christ==\n\nThe sculpture is installed on the sidewalk in front of Christ House, a medical facility for homeless men. The statue represents Christ offering to wash the feet of the people of the [[Adams Morgan]] neighborhood where the sculpture is located. The sculpture faces towards the building at a relief on the wall and under the window of a sun-room. According to the artist, \"the men in the sunroom window become a living part of the men and women and children in the Frieze, which represents the richness of the cultural diversity in Adams Morgan.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nWhen the piece was installed, people questioned why Mason would want to have the piece displayed outside \"where it would surely be abused.\" In response, Mason said \"there is very little they could do to him that hasn\u2019t already been done.\"<ref name=\"Curtiss\">{{cite web |last1=Curtiss |first1=Victoria G. |title=A Fourth Church Sermon by Victoria G.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.  The other consortium comprised [[IVG Immobilien|IVG]], [[Vienna Airport|Flughafen Wien AG]], Dorsch-Consult, [[Commerzbank]] and [[Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations|Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts]]. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder. This saw them granted exclusive authority to negotiate the terms and conditions for an acquisition of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport holding and the construction and operation of the new airport for 50 years.<ref name=\"welt\">{{cite news| url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article630849/Hochtief-baut-in-Schoenefeld.html| work=[[Die Welt]]| title=Hochtief baut in Sch\u00f6nefeld| date=19 September 1998| last=Sch\u00fcmann| first=Timm| language=German| trans-title=Hochtief expands in Sch\u00f6nefeld}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 1999, BBF officially commissioned Hochtief and its partners to construct the new airport, causing IVG to file a lawsuit. The Brandenburg [[Oberlandesgericht]] acknowledged the concerns voiced by IVG. In its review, it found that in certain points the assessment of the applications had been biased towards Hochtief.

In the terminal building, the system was not built according to the [[construction permit]] and failed the [[Technischer \u00dcberwachungsverein|mandatory acceptance test]] necessary to open the airport. FBB proposed an interim solution employing up to 700 human fire spotters, which the building supervision department of the local [[Dahme-Spreewald]] district rejected.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joshua Hammer Reprints |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-07-23/how-berlin-s-futuristic-airport-became-a-6-billion-embarrassment |title=How Berlin's Futuristic Airport Became a $6 Billion Embarrassment |publisher=Bloomberg |date=23 July 2015}}</ref> Inspectors uncovered flaws in the wiring, programming and implementation of the highly complex system designed by [[Siemens]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]].

Inspectors have uncovered many examples of poor workmanship due to a lack of proper supervision and documentation, most notably concerning the wiring. Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

They are the same company which designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport which opened in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At BER the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called ''midfield airport'' above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers. [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas Germany]] will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 [[jet bridge]]s with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. Lufthansa and [[Air France]]/[[KLM]] will operate [[airport lounge]]s in the main pier which will also be open for passengers of the respective [[airline alliance|alliance partners]].<ref name=\"Handbuch\">{{cite book|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |title=Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg Handbuch |publisher=Berliner Flughafen-Gesellschaft mbH |accessdate=6 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417010130/http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/GeschaeftskundenUndPartner/Touristik/Handbuch_Flughafen_Berlin_Brandenburg_deutsch.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:120513-BER-innen.JPG|thumb|The main hall of the terminal]]\nThe south pier was reserved for near-exclusive use of defunct [[Air Berlin]] and its [[Oneworld]] partners.

The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin.

A further ''Business Park North'' was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld terminal. However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents.

The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.  The other consortium comprised [[IVG Immobilien|IVG]], [[Vienna Airport|Flughafen Wien AG]], Dorsch-Consult, [[Commerzbank]] and [[Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations|Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts]]. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder. This saw them granted exclusive authority to negotiate the terms and conditions for an acquisition of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport holding and the construction and operation of the new airport for 50 years.<ref name=\"welt\">{{cite news| url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article630849/Hochtief-baut-in-Schoenefeld.html| work=[[Die Welt]]| title=Hochtief baut in Sch\u00f6nefeld| date=19 September 1998| last=Sch\u00fcmann| first=Timm| language=German| trans-title=Hochtief expands in Sch\u00f6nefeld}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 1999, BBF officially commissioned Hochtief and its partners to construct the new airport, causing IVG to file a lawsuit. The Brandenburg [[Oberlandesgericht]] acknowledged the concerns voiced by IVG. In its review, it found that in certain points the assessment of the applications had been biased towards Hochtief.

It became clear on 8 May 2012 that the building could not open on schedule, officially due to the failure of the fire protection system. In reality, according to a Brandenburg State Audit report in February 2016 the usability of the airport was at 56.2% (there were no ticket counters, the escalators did not work, etc.).

On the retail side of the airport, shops and restaurants prepared for the opening. As the airports in Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld were to close once the last flights of 2 June had been serviced, a major logistics operation for moving the airports' infrastructure was launched. Vehicles, equipment and supplies that were needed at Tegel until the final moments would have been transported to BER during the night of 2\u20133 June. To allow this, the authorities planned to restrict the highways linking the two airports ([[Bundesautobahn 113|A113]], [[Bundesautobahn 100|A100]] and parts of [[Bundesautobahn 111|A111]]) to airport traffic only.<ref name=\"megamove\">{{cite news| url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20120411-41867.html| title=Mega move to new Berlin Airport begins|date=11 April 2012| work=[[The Local]]}}</ref> [[Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg]], the national broadcaster for Berlin and Brandenburg, scheduled 24 hours of continuous live coverage of the airport move.<ref name=\"rbb\">{{cite press release| title=24 h Airport \u2013 Der Flughafenumzug live| trans-title=24 h Airport: The Airport Move Live| date=30 April 2012| publisher=RBB| url=http://www.rbb-online.de/themen/flughafen-ber/flughafen_ber/programmtipp/24_stunden_live.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217064110/http://www.rbb-online.de/themen/flughafen-ber/flughafen_ber/programmtipp/24_stunden_live.html| url-status=dead|archive-date=17 February 2013| language=German}}</ref> A special Lufthansa flight to [[Frankfurt Airport]], operated with an [[Airbus A380]], was scheduled as the first departure from the new airport on 3 June at 06:00.<ref name=\"rbb\" />\n\nOn 8 May 2012 just 26 days before the move, FBB again postponed the opening date.

Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers.

The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].

The issue is complicated by the fact that the line would have to cross the state border and it is unclear who would have to pay for which parts of construction operations and maintenance. While Berlin has many \"ghost stations\" built in preparation for potential future construction, there is no provision underneath the terminal building for a subway station.\n\n===Road===\n[[File:Berlin Stra\u00dfenverkehr BER.png|thumb|Map of motorways in Berlin]]\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport is connected by its own exit to the [[Bundesautobahn 113|A113]]. The road carries traffic into Berlin to the [[Bundesautobahn 100|A100]] and out to the [[Bundesautobahn 10|A10]] where it continues south as the [[Bundesautobahn 13|A13]] in the direction of Dresden. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin. There are also concerns at increased accidents and air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/neues-verkehrsgutachten-zum-hauptstadtflughafen-der-ber-koennte-die-stadtautobahn-lahmlegen/14535896.html |title=Der BER k\u00f6nnte die Stadtautobahn lahmlegen|trans-title=BER could cripple traffic on city highways |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> The traffic volumes would also cause frequent closings of the Britz tunnel on the A100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/kolumne/wenn-der-flughafen-ber-oeffnet-dann-schliesst-der-tunnel-britz-2|title=Wenn der Flughafen BER \u00f6ffnet, dann schlie\u00dft der Tunnel Britz|trans-title=if BER opens tunnel Britz closes}}\n</ref>\n\nOver 10% of passengers are expected to come from [[Poland]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/verkehr/hauptstadtflughafen-landkreis-warnt-vor--verkehrsinfarkt--am-ber-29614178| title=Hauptstadtflughafen Landkreis warnt vor \"Verkehrsinfarkt\" am BER |accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> also thanks to upgraded highways on the Polish side of the border.

The X11 bus continues to [[Lichterfelde-West]] and to [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]].

A further ''Business Park North'' was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld terminal. However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents. This prompted a wave of protests and a lawsuit that the courts rejected.<ref name=warner>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-749894.html| work=Der Spiegel| title=Resistance Builds to Planned Flight Paths at New Berlin Airport| date=3 November 2011| first=Mary Beth| last=Warner}}</ref>\n\nBoth the expansion of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport into BER and the quality of the connection to the railway network are the subject of public debate. The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.
