At first, the band had [[Beat music|beat]] influences and Schenker himself handled the vocals.<ref>{{cite web|quote=The first members were Joachim Kirchhoff (bass), Rudolf Schenker (guitar), Katty Vollmer (guitar) und Wolfgang Dziony (drums). The band played the songs of the British charts, mainly the songs of the [[Beatles]]|author=Blazek, Matthias|title=Das nieders\u00e4chsische Bandkompendium 1963\u20132003 \u2013 Daten und Fakten von 100 Rockgruppen aus Niedersachsen, Celle |date=2006 |isbn=978-3-00-018947-0|page=8|url=http://www.hannover-live.com/urscorpfl.html|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Things began to come together in 1970 when Schenker's younger brother [[Michael Schenker|Michael]] and vocalist [[Klaus Meine]] joined the band. With this line-up they won a music contest in 1972 and recorded two songs for a single that was never released on the CCA label, but the songs, early versions of [[the Sweet]] cover \"[[Action (Sweet song)|Action]]\" and the original \"I'm Going Mad\" were later released on different compilation albums including Psychedelic Gems 2.\n\nIn 1972, the group recorded and released their debut album ''[[Lonesome Crow]]'', with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums and re-recorded versions of their CCA songs.<ref name=\"Music Legends\" /> During the ''Lonesome Crow'' tour, the Scorpions opened for upcoming British band [[UFO (band)|UFO]]. Near the end of the tour, guitarist [[Michael Schenker]] accepted an offer of lead guitar for UFO. [[Uli Jon Roth]], a friend of Michael's, was then introduced to the band and he helped them to finish off the tour.\n\nThe departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In 1973, [[Ulrich Roth|Uli Roth]], who had helped the Scorpions complete the ''Lonesome Crow'' tour, was offered the role as lead guitarist, but turned the band down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Rudolf Schenker eventually decided he wanted to work with Roth, but did not want to resurrect the last Scorpions lineup. He attended some of Dawn Road's rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which consisted of Roth, [[Francis Buchholz]] (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards) and [[J\u00fcrgen Rosenthal]] (drums). Uli Roth and Buchholz persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join on vocals, which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because it was well known in the German hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulijonroth.com/sky/bands_concepts/scorpions_2.htm |title=Official ULI JON ROTH Website |publisher=Ulijonroth.com |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410083007/http://www.ulijonroth.com/sky/bands_concepts/scorpions_2.htm |archivedate=10 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Rise to fame (1974\u20131978)===\nIn 1974, the new line-up released ''[[Fly to the Rainbow]]''. The album proved to be more successful than ''Lonesome Crow'' and songs such as \"Speedy's Coming\" and the title track established the band's sound. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recordings. Soon after, [[J\u00fcrgen Rosenthal]] had to leave as he was drafted into the army. In 1976, he joined a German progressive rock band called [[Eloy (band)|Eloy]] recording three albums. He was replaced in July 1974 by J\u00fcrgen Fechter. In 1975, Rudy Lenners from [[Belgium]] became the next drummer.\n\n[[File:Scorpions Logo.svg|thumb|The Scorpions logo, used since 1975]]\nThat year, the band released ''[[In Trance]]'', which marked the beginning of their long collaboration with German producer [[Dieter Dierks]]. The album was a huge step forward for the Scorpions and established their heavy metal formula. It garnered a fan base at home and abroad with cuts such as \"In Trance\", \"Dark Lady\" and \"Robot Man\".\n\nMeanwhile, as \"The Hunters\", the band recorded \"Fuchs geh' voran\" and \"Wenn es richtig losgeht\", German cover versions of \"[[Action (Sweet song)|Action]]\" and \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\" by [[the Sweet]] for EMI's [[Electrola]] label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/lower+saxony/hannover/the+hunters|title=The Hunters|website=Rockdectector.com|publisher=MusicMight|access-date=30 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415221257/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/lower+saxony/hannover/the+hunters|archive-date=15 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Scorpions released ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', the album cover of which featured a [[nudity|nude]] prepubescent girl behind a broken pane of glass. The cover art was designed by Stefan Bohle, who was the product manager for [[RCA Records]],<ref name=\"RothRules\" /> their label at the time. The cover brought the band considerable market exposure but was subsequently pulled or replaced in other countries. The album itself garnered widespread praise for its music from select critics and fan base. In 2008, the cover art on the [[English Wikipedia]] was briefly [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|blacklisted]] by the [[Internet Watch Foundation]], before reversing their decision 4 days later.\n\nThe following year, Rudy Lenners resigned for personal reasons and was replaced by [[Herman Rarebell]], an experienced musician who had recorded with the bands Missus Beastly and [[Onyx (Cornish band)|Onyx]].\n\nFor the follow-up ''[[Taken by Force]]'', RCA Records made a determined effort to promote the album in stores and on the radio. The album's single, \"Steamrock Fever\", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, [[Electric Sun]] prior to the release of the resultant double live album ''[[Tokyo Tapes (album)|Tokyo Tapes]]''. ''Tokyo Tapes'' was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid-1978, after auditioning around 140 guitarists, the Scorpions recruited Matthias Jabs.\n\n===Commercial success (1978\u20131992)===\nFollowing the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for [[Mercury Records]] in the United States and [[Harvest Records|Harvest]]/EMI Electrola worldwide to record their next album ''[[Lovedrive]]''. Just weeks after quitting UFO, Michael Schenker returned to the group for a short period during the recordings for the album. This gave the band three guitarists. ''[[Lovedrive]]'' was an album that some critics consider to be the pinnacle of their career.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17523|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic review of the album|accessdate= 18 May 2007|publisher=allmusic.com}}</ref> Containing such fan favourites as \"Loving You Sunday Morning\", \"Always Somewhere\", \"Holiday\" and the instrumental \"Coast to Coast\", it firmly cemented the \"Scorpions formula\" of hard rock songs mixed with melodic ballads. Although it had been widely believed for decades that Michael Schenker's contribution to the record was only limited to three songs, he vehemently maintained he appeared on the whole album during an interview with satellite radio host [[Eddie Trunk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHreGTAqLZo&t=18m17s|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com}}</ref> The album's provocative artwork was named \"Best album sleeve of 1979\" by [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]], yet ultimately changed for American release. ''Lovedrive'' reached No.&nbsp;55 on the US charts, demonstrating that the band was gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album the band decided to retain Michael in the band, forcing Jabs to leave. However, in April 1979, during their tour in France, Michael quit and Jabs was brought in permanently to replace him.\n\nIn 1980, the band released ''[[Animal Magnetism (Scorpions album)|Animal Magnetism]]'', again with a provocative cover this time showing a girl kneeling and a Doberman Pinscher sitting in front of a man. ''Animal Magnetism'' contained classics such as \"[[The Zoo (Scorpions song)|The Zoo]]\" and \"Make It Real\". Soon after the album's release, Meine began experiencing throat problems. He required surgery on his vocal cords and doubts were raised{{by whom|date=February 2018}} about whether he would ever sing again.\n\nMeanwhile, the band began working on their next album, ''[[Blackout (Scorpions album)|Blackout]]'' in 1981. [[Don Dokken]] was brought in to provide guide and backing vocals while Meine recovered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035057/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviews01/don_dokken_interview.htm|url-status=dead|title=Classic Rock Revisited your online source for Rock and Metal fans|archivedate=12 October 2007|website=Classicrockrevisited.com|accessdate=2 October 2019}}</ref> Meine eventually healed completely and was able to finish the album. ''Blackout'' was released in 1982 and quickly became the band's best selling album to date, eventually going platinum. Meine's voice showed no signs of weakness and fan response to the album was good. ''Blackout'' spawned two singles: \"[[No One Like You]]\" and \"[[Can't Live Without You (Scorpions song)|Can't Live Without You]]\".\n\nGaining in popularity from the success of ''Blackout'', the Scorpions performed to over 375,000 fans on Day 2 at the three-day [[US Festival]] concert held in San Bernardino, California during Memorial Day Weekend of 1983. The concert was aired live on MTV, giving the band wide exposure in a live show.\n\nThe 1984 album ''[[Love at First Sting]]'' cemented the Scorpions' status as an internationally popular band. Propelled by the single \"[[Rock You Like a Hurricane]]\", ''Love at First Sting'' climbed the charts and went double platinum in the USA a few months after its release.\n\n[[MTV]] gave the album's videos \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\", \"Bad Boys Running Wild\", \"Big City Nights\", and the [[power ballad]] \"[[Still Loving You]]\" significant airtime greatly contributing to the album's success. The channel even supplied Scorpions with the nickname \"The Ambassadors of Rock\" to the chagrin of industry insiders who recognized the executive influence behind the scenes. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named them \"The Heroes of Heavy Metal\".\n\nThe band toured extensively behind ''Love at First Sting'' and released their second live album, ''[[World Wide Live]]'' in 1985. Recorded over a year-long world tour and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at No.&nbsp;14 in the charts in the US and at No.&nbsp;18 in the UK.\n\nAfter their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record ''[[Savage Amusement]]''. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, ''Savage Amusement'' represented a more polished and mature sound similar to the style [[Def Leppard]] had found success with. The album sold well but was considered somewhat of a critical disappointment. However, British heavy rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' did award the album five K's out of five.\n\nOn the ''Savage Amusement'' tour in 1988, the Scorpions became only the second Western group (not American) to play in the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] had performed in December 1987 in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. The following year the band returned to perform at the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]]. As a result, the Scorpions developed an extended Russian fan base and still return to perform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Scorpions-Nov2003.htm |title=Scorpions Interview with Klaus Meine |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Also in 1989, Scorpions released the compilation album ''[[Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads]]'', which, in addition to the band's hits from 1979 to 1988, included several rare or previously unreleased tracks: \"Hey You\", from the ''[[Animal Magnetism (Scorpions album)|Animal Magnetism]]'' sessions; the re-recorded \"long version\" of \"Is There Anybody There?\"; and a cover of [[The Who]]'s \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", which was also included on that same year's ''[[Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell]]'' charity compilation album. This is the Scorpions' only compilation album to be certified platinum in the United States.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/>\n\nWishing to distance themselves from the ''Savage Amusement'' style, the band separated from their long-time producer and \"Sixth Scorpion\", [[Dieter Dierks]], replacing him with [[Keith Olsen]] when they returned to the studio in 1990. ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' was released that year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad \"[[Wind of Change (Scorpions song)|Wind of Change]]\". The song muses on the socio-political changes that were occurring in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world at the end of the [[Cold War]]. ''Crazy World'' is the band's last album to receive gold or platinum certification in the United States.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/> On 21 July 1990, they joined many other guests for [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin|massive performance]] of ''[[The Wall]]'' in Berlin. Scorpions performed both versions of \"[[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]\" from ''The Wall''.\n\nAfter the ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' tour Francis Buchholz, the band's long-serving bassist, left the group.\n\n===Later days (1993\u20132009)===\nIn 1993, the Scorpions released ''[[Face the Heat]]''. Bass was handled by Ralph Rieckermann. For the recording process, the band brought in producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]]. The album's sound was more metal than melodic. Neither the heavy metal single \"Alien Nation\" nor the ballad \"Under The Same Sun\" came close to matching the success of \"Wind of Change\". ''Face the Heat'' was a moderate success. In 1995, a new album, ''Live Bites'', was produced. The disc documented retro live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a technologically cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, ''World Wide Live'', it was not as successful.\n\nPrior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996's ''[[Pure Instinct]]'', drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording label. [[Curt Cress]] took charge of the drumsticks for the album before Louisville, Kentucky-born [[James Kottak]] took over permanently. The album had many ballads. Still, the album's singles \"Wild Child\" and the soothing [[Rock ballad|ballad]] \"[[You and I (Scorpions song)|You and I]]\" both enjoyed moderate success.\n\n1999 saw the release of ''[[Eye II Eye]]'' and a significant change in the band's style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, it was not received well by fans. The video to the album's first European single, \"To Be No.&nbsp;1\", featured a [[Monica Lewinsky]] look-alike which did little to improve its popularity.\n\nThe following year, the Scorpions had an artistic collaboration with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] that resulted in a 10-song album named ''[[Moment of Glory]]''. The album went a long way toward rebuilding the band's reputation after the harsh criticism of ''[[Eye II Eye]]''. However, critics accused them of following on the coattails of [[Metallica]]'s similar collaboration (''[[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]]'') with the [[San Francisco Symphony]] which had been released the previous year, even though the orchestra had first approached the Scorpions with the idea in <!-- wikilinked 2 paras ago -->1995.\n\n[[File:Scorpions (10) cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Scorpions in 2007]]\nIn 2001, the Scorpions released ''[[Acoustica (Scorpions album)|Acoustica]]'', a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band's biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and ''Acoustica'' did little to return the band to the spotlight.\n\nIn 2004, the band released ''[[Unbreakable (Scorpions album)|Unbreakable]]'', an album that was hailed by critics as a long-awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since ''Face the Heat''. Whether a result of poor promotion by the band's label or the long time between studio releases, ''Unbreakable'' received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album and played as \"Special Guests\" with [[Judas Priest]] during the 2005 British tour\u2014these were the Scorpions' first dates in the UK since 1999.\n\nIn early 2006, the Scorpions released the DVD ''1 Night in Vienna'' that included 14 live tracks and a complete [[rockumentary]]. In LA, the band spent about four months in the studio with producers James Michael and [[Desmond Child]] working on a [[concept album]] titled ''[[Humanity: Hour I]]'', which was released in late May 2007,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/60273 |title=> News > New SCORPIONS Album Title, Artwork Revealed |publisher=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> and was followed by the \"[[Humanity World Tour]]\".\n\nIn 2007, the band collaborated with two of their signature tracks in the video game series, ''Guitar Hero''. \"No One Like You\" was featured on the ''Rocks the '80s'' version of the game while \"Rock You Like A Hurricane\" was released on ''Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock''.\n\nOn 14 May 2007, the Scorpions released ''Humanity \u2013 Hour I'' in Europe. ''Humanity \u2013 Hour I'' became available in the U.S. on August 28 on [[Universal Music Group|New Door Records]], entering the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts at number No.&nbsp;63.\n\nIn a September 2007 podcast interview, Meine said the album was not so much a \"concept album\", but rather a collection of songs with a common theme. \"We didn't want to make another record with songs about boys chasing girls. I mean, come on, give me a break,\" Meine said.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |title=Klaus Meine podcast interview |publisher=Stuck in the 80s |url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2007/09/scorpions-inter.html |accessdate=26 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119085220/http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2007/09/scorpions-inter.html |archivedate=19 November 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAsked in 2007 if the band was planning to release a ''Humanity \u2013 Hour II'', Meine replied:\n{{quote|That is what everybody is asking.

At first, the band had [[Beat music|beat]] influences and Schenker himself handled the vocals.<ref>{{cite web|quote=The first members were Joachim Kirchhoff (bass), Rudolf Schenker (guitar), Katty Vollmer (guitar) und Wolfgang Dziony (drums). The band played the songs of the British charts, mainly the songs of the [[Beatles]]|author=Blazek, Matthias|title=Das nieders\u00e4chsische Bandkompendium 1963\u20132003 \u2013 Daten und Fakten von 100 Rockgruppen aus Niedersachsen, Celle |date=2006 |isbn=978-3-00-018947-0|page=8|url=http://www.hannover-live.com/urscorpfl.html|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Things began to come together in 1970 when Schenker's younger brother [[Michael Schenker|Michael]] and vocalist [[Klaus Meine]] joined the band. With this line-up they won a music contest in 1972 and recorded two songs for a single that was never released on the CCA label, but the songs, early versions of [[the Sweet]] cover \"[[Action (Sweet song)|Action]]\" and the original \"I'm Going Mad\" were later released on different compilation albums including Psychedelic Gems 2.\n\nIn 1972, the group recorded and released their debut album ''[[Lonesome Crow]]'', with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums and re-recorded versions of their CCA songs.<ref name=\"Music Legends\" /> During the ''Lonesome Crow'' tour, the Scorpions opened for upcoming British band [[UFO (band)|UFO]]. Near the end of the tour, guitarist [[Michael Schenker]] accepted an offer of lead guitar for UFO. [[Uli Jon Roth]], a friend of Michael's, was then introduced to the band and he helped them to finish off the tour.\n\nThe departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In 1973, [[Ulrich Roth|Uli Roth]], who had helped the Scorpions complete the ''Lonesome Crow'' tour, was offered the role as lead guitarist, but turned the band down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Rudolf Schenker eventually decided he wanted to work with Roth, but did not want to resurrect the last Scorpions lineup. He attended some of Dawn Road's rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which consisted of Roth, [[Francis Buchholz]] (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards) and [[J\u00fcrgen Rosenthal]] (drums). Uli Roth and Buchholz persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join on vocals, which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because it was well known in the German hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulijonroth.com/sky/bands_concepts/scorpions_2.htm |title=Official ULI JON ROTH Website |publisher=Ulijonroth.com |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410083007/http://www.ulijonroth.com/sky/bands_concepts/scorpions_2.htm |archivedate=10 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Rise to fame (1974\u20131978)===\nIn 1974, the new line-up released ''[[Fly to the Rainbow]]''. The album proved to be more successful than ''Lonesome Crow'' and songs such as \"Speedy's Coming\" and the title track established the band's sound. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recordings. Soon after, [[J\u00fcrgen Rosenthal]] had to leave as he was drafted into the army. In 1976, he joined a German progressive rock band called [[Eloy (band)|Eloy]] recording three albums. He was replaced in July 1974 by J\u00fcrgen Fechter. In 1975, Rudy Lenners from [[Belgium]] became the next drummer.\n\n[[File:Scorpions Logo.svg|thumb|The Scorpions logo, used since 1975]]\nThat year, the band released ''[[In Trance]]'', which marked the beginning of their long collaboration with German producer [[Dieter Dierks]]. The album was a huge step forward for the Scorpions and established their heavy metal formula. It garnered a fan base at home and abroad with cuts such as \"In Trance\", \"Dark Lady\" and \"Robot Man\".\n\nMeanwhile, as \"The Hunters\", the band recorded \"Fuchs geh' voran\" and \"Wenn es richtig losgeht\", German cover versions of \"[[Action (Sweet song)|Action]]\" and \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\" by [[the Sweet]] for EMI's [[Electrola]] label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/lower+saxony/hannover/the+hunters|title=The Hunters|website=Rockdectector.com|publisher=MusicMight|access-date=30 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415221257/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/lower+saxony/hannover/the+hunters|archive-date=15 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Scorpions released ''[[Virgin Killer]]'', the album cover of which featured a [[nudity|nude]] prepubescent girl behind a broken pane of glass. The cover art was designed by Stefan Bohle, who was the product manager for [[RCA Records]],<ref name=\"RothRules\" /> their label at the time. The cover brought the band considerable market exposure but was subsequently pulled or replaced in other countries. The album itself garnered widespread praise for its music from select critics and fan base. In 2008, the cover art on the [[English Wikipedia]] was briefly [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|blacklisted]] by the [[Internet Watch Foundation]], before reversing their decision 4 days later.\n\nThe following year, Rudy Lenners resigned for personal reasons and was replaced by [[Herman Rarebell]], an experienced musician who had recorded with the bands Missus Beastly and [[Onyx (Cornish band)|Onyx]].\n\nFor the follow-up ''[[Taken by Force]]'', RCA Records made a determined effort to promote the album in stores and on the radio. The album's single, \"Steamrock Fever\", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, [[Electric Sun]] prior to the release of the resultant double live album ''[[Tokyo Tapes (album)|Tokyo Tapes]]''. ''Tokyo Tapes'' was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid-1978, after auditioning around 140 guitarists, the Scorpions recruited Matthias Jabs.\n\n===Commercial success (1978\u20131992)===\nFollowing the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for [[Mercury Records]] in the United States and [[Harvest Records|Harvest]]/EMI Electrola worldwide to record their next album ''[[Lovedrive]]''. Just weeks after quitting UFO, Michael Schenker returned to the group for a short period during the recordings for the album. This gave the band three guitarists. ''[[Lovedrive]]'' was an album that some critics consider to be the pinnacle of their career.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17523|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic review of the album|accessdate= 18 May 2007|publisher=allmusic.com}}</ref> Containing such fan favourites as \"Loving You Sunday Morning\", \"Always Somewhere\", \"Holiday\" and the instrumental \"Coast to Coast\", it firmly cemented the \"Scorpions formula\" of hard rock songs mixed with melodic ballads. Although it had been widely believed for decades that Michael Schenker's contribution to the record was only limited to three songs, he vehemently maintained he appeared on the whole album during an interview with satellite radio host [[Eddie Trunk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHreGTAqLZo&t=18m17s|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com}}</ref> The album's provocative artwork was named \"Best album sleeve of 1979\" by [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]], yet ultimately changed for American release. ''Lovedrive'' reached No.&nbsp;55 on the US charts, demonstrating that the band was gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album the band decided to retain Michael in the band, forcing Jabs to leave. However, in April 1979, during their tour in France, Michael quit and Jabs was brought in permanently to replace him.\n\nIn 1980, the band released ''[[Animal Magnetism (Scorpions album)|Animal Magnetism]]'', again with a provocative cover this time showing a girl kneeling and a Doberman Pinscher sitting in front of a man. ''Animal Magnetism'' contained classics such as \"[[The Zoo (Scorpions song)|The Zoo]]\" and \"Make It Real\". Soon after the album's release, Meine began experiencing throat problems. He required surgery on his vocal cords and doubts were raised{{by whom|date=February 2018}} about whether he would ever sing again.\n\nMeanwhile, the band began working on their next album, ''[[Blackout (Scorpions album)|Blackout]]'' in 1981. [[Don Dokken]] was brought in to provide guide and backing vocals while Meine recovered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035057/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviews01/don_dokken_interview.htm|url-status=dead|title=Classic Rock Revisited your online source for Rock and Metal fans|archivedate=12 October 2007|website=Classicrockrevisited.com|accessdate=2 October 2019}}</ref> Meine eventually healed completely and was able to finish the album. ''Blackout'' was released in 1982 and quickly became the band's best selling album to date, eventually going platinum. Meine's voice showed no signs of weakness and fan response to the album was good. ''Blackout'' spawned two singles: \"[[No One Like You]]\" and \"[[Can't Live Without You (Scorpions song)|Can't Live Without You]]\".\n\nGaining in popularity from the success of ''Blackout'', the Scorpions performed to over 375,000 fans on Day 2 at the three-day [[US Festival]] concert held in San Bernardino, California during Memorial Day Weekend of 1983. The concert was aired live on MTV, giving the band wide exposure in a live show.\n\nThe 1984 album ''[[Love at First Sting]]'' cemented the Scorpions' status as an internationally popular band. Propelled by the single \"[[Rock You Like a Hurricane]]\", ''Love at First Sting'' climbed the charts and went double platinum in the USA a few months after its release.\n\n[[MTV]] gave the album's videos \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\", \"Bad Boys Running Wild\", \"Big City Nights\", and the [[power ballad]] \"[[Still Loving You]]\" significant airtime greatly contributing to the album's success. The channel even supplied Scorpions with the nickname \"The Ambassadors of Rock\" to the chagrin of industry insiders who recognized the executive influence behind the scenes. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named them \"The Heroes of Heavy Metal\".\n\nThe band toured extensively behind ''Love at First Sting'' and released their second live album, ''[[World Wide Live]]'' in 1985. Recorded over a year-long world tour and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at No.&nbsp;14 in the charts in the US and at No.&nbsp;18 in the UK.\n\nAfter their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record ''[[Savage Amusement]]''. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, ''Savage Amusement'' represented a more polished and mature sound similar to the style [[Def Leppard]] had found success with. The album sold well but was considered somewhat of a critical disappointment. However, British heavy rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' did award the album five K's out of five.\n\nOn the ''Savage Amusement'' tour in 1988, the Scorpions became only the second Western group (not American) to play in the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] had performed in December 1987 in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. The following year the band returned to perform at the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]]. As a result, the Scorpions developed an extended Russian fan base and still return to perform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/Scorpions-Nov2003.htm |title=Scorpions Interview with Klaus Meine |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Also in 1989, Scorpions released the compilation album ''[[Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads]]'', which, in addition to the band's hits from 1979 to 1988, included several rare or previously unreleased tracks: \"Hey You\", from the ''[[Animal Magnetism (Scorpions album)|Animal Magnetism]]'' sessions; the re-recorded \"long version\" of \"Is There Anybody There?\"; and a cover of [[The Who]]'s \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", which was also included on that same year's ''[[Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell]]'' charity compilation album. This is the Scorpions' only compilation album to be certified platinum in the United States.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/>\n\nWishing to distance themselves from the ''Savage Amusement'' style, the band separated from their long-time producer and \"Sixth Scorpion\", [[Dieter Dierks]], replacing him with [[Keith Olsen]] when they returned to the studio in 1990. ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' was released that year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad \"[[Wind of Change (Scorpions song)|Wind of Change]]\". The song muses on the socio-political changes that were occurring in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world at the end of the [[Cold War]]. ''Crazy World'' is the band's last album to receive gold or platinum certification in the United States.<ref name=\"RIAA\"/> On 21 July 1990, they joined many other guests for [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin|massive performance]] of ''[[The Wall]]'' in Berlin. Scorpions performed both versions of \"[[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]\" from ''The Wall''.\n\nAfter the ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'' tour Francis Buchholz, the band's long-serving bassist, left the group.\n\n===Later days (1993\u20132009)===\nIn 1993, the Scorpions released ''[[Face the Heat]]''. Bass was handled by Ralph Rieckermann. For the recording process, the band brought in producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]]. The album's sound was more metal than melodic. Neither the heavy metal single \"Alien Nation\" nor the ballad \"Under The Same Sun\" came close to matching the success of \"Wind of Change\". ''Face the Heat'' was a moderate success. In 1995, a new album, ''Live Bites'', was produced. The disc documented retro live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a technologically cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, ''World Wide Live'', it was not as successful.\n\nPrior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996's ''[[Pure Instinct]]'', drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording label. [[Curt Cress]] took charge of the drumsticks for the album before Louisville, Kentucky-born [[James Kottak]] took over permanently. The album had many ballads. Still, the album's singles \"Wild Child\" and the soothing [[Rock ballad|ballad]] \"[[You and I (Scorpions song)|You and I]]\" both enjoyed moderate success.\n\n1999 saw the release of ''[[Eye II Eye]]'' and a significant change in the band's style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, it was not received well by fans. The video to the album's first European single, \"To Be No.&nbsp;1\", featured a [[Monica Lewinsky]] look-alike which did little to improve its popularity.\n\nThe following year, the Scorpions had an artistic collaboration with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] that resulted in a 10-song album named ''[[Moment of Glory]]''. The album went a long way toward rebuilding the band's reputation after the harsh criticism of ''[[Eye II Eye]]''. However, critics accused them of following on the coattails of [[Metallica]]'s similar collaboration (''[[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]]'') with the [[San Francisco Symphony]] which had been released the previous year, even though the orchestra had first approached the Scorpions with the idea in <!-- wikilinked 2 paras ago -->1995.\n\n[[File:Scorpions (10) cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Scorpions in 2007]]\nIn 2001, the Scorpions released ''[[Acoustica (Scorpions album)|Acoustica]]'', a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band's biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and ''Acoustica'' did little to return the band to the spotlight.\n\nIn 2004, the band released ''[[Unbreakable (Scorpions album)|Unbreakable]]'', an album that was hailed by critics as a long-awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since ''Face the Heat''. Whether a result of poor promotion by the band's label or the long time between studio releases, ''Unbreakable'' received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album and played as \"Special Guests\" with [[Judas Priest]] during the 2005 British tour\u2014these were the Scorpions' first dates in the UK since 1999.\n\nIn early 2006, the Scorpions released the DVD ''1 Night in Vienna'' that included 14 live tracks and a complete [[rockumentary]]. In LA, the band spent about four months in the studio with producers James Michael and [[Desmond Child]] working on a [[concept album]] titled ''[[Humanity: Hour I]]'', which was released in late May 2007,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/60273 |title=> News > New SCORPIONS Album Title, Artwork Revealed |publisher=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> and was followed by the \"[[Humanity World Tour]]\".\n\nIn 2007, the band collaborated with two of their signature tracks in the video game series, ''Guitar Hero''. \"No One Like You\" was featured on the ''Rocks the '80s'' version of the game while \"Rock You Like A Hurricane\" was released on ''Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock''.\n\nOn 14 May 2007, the Scorpions released ''Humanity \u2013 Hour I'' in Europe. ''Humanity \u2013 Hour I'' became available in the U.S. on August 28 on [[Universal Music Group|New Door Records]], entering the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts at number No.&nbsp;63.\n\nIn a September 2007 podcast interview, Meine said the album was not so much a \"concept album\", but rather a collection of songs with a common theme. \"We didn't want to make another record with songs about boys chasing girls. I mean, come on, give me a break,\" Meine said.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |title=Klaus Meine podcast interview |publisher=Stuck in the 80s |url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2007/09/scorpions-inter.html |accessdate=26 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119085220/http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2007/09/scorpions-inter.html |archivedate=19 November 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAsked in 2007 if the band was planning to release a ''Humanity \u2013 Hour II'', Meine replied:\n{{quote|That is what everybody is asking.

The [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] is a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]- and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate-styled]] [[mansion]] built by John Hampden Randolph in 1859, and is the largest extant [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] plantation house in the South with {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of floor space.\n\n==Mansion and grounds==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation House.jpg|thumb|left|250px|North Front of Nottoway]]\nJohn Randolph commissioned renowned architect [[Henry Howard (architect)|Henry Howard]] of [[New Orleans]] with the task of designing the grand mansion with the intention that no expense would be spared in the construction. Howard sited the three-story wooden frame house, that includes a one-story rusticated stucco-covered brick base on a concrete foundation, to face east towards the [[Mississippi River]]. The entrance facade is asymmetrically balanced with a projecting bedroom wing to the left side and a large curved bay with galleries on the right. The main five-bay structure, with a central projecting portico, emphasizes height rather than width with the main living areas on the second and third-stories both being {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} in height above the one-story basement, scored to appear as stone, and featuring an arched niche flanked with narrow [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestrations]]. The galleries are embellished with custom ornamental iron railings made in New Orleans, capped with molded wooden handrails. Double curved [[granite]] staircases, installed by skilled mason, Newton Richards, rise to the second-story. These steps were built with the left side intended for ladies and the right side for gentlemen. The steps for the men can also be identified by the boot scraper at the bottom. The separate staircases were so that the men would not see the women's ankles beneath their skirts as they climbed, which was considered a severe breach of social [[etiquette]] at the time. The close spacing and angularity of the gallery's 22 square columns and their elongated capitals also emphasize the vertical qualities of the house. Above the capitals, small brackets branch out to carry a tall [[entablature]] decorated with [[modillions]], supporting a projecting [[cornice]] that nearly covers the hipped roof that is pierced with six chimneys. In the rear of the house is a two-story [[studio apartment|gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re]] wing where the Randolph sons resided.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway Plantation|url=http://www.knowla.org/entry/1727/|publisher=Knowla.org|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of Nottoway was completed in 1859 at an estimated cost of $80,000; to prevent any duplicate homes being built, Randolph destroyed the architect's plans after completion.\n\n===Interiors===\n[[File:Nottoway Interior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The White Ballroom]][[File:Nottoway Dining Room.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Dining Room]]\nNottoway has over an acre of floor space spread out over three floors, and a total of 64 rooms with 165 doors and 200 windows, most of which can also double as doors.  The house enjoyed 19th-century novelties such as a bathroom located on each floor with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water, gas lighting throughout the house and a complex servant call bell system. The principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. The entrance hall runs the length of the house and is 12 feet wide and 40 feet long. Large [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] and brass chandeliers hang from the {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} high ceilings and the doors with hand-painted German Dresden porcelain doorknobs and matching keyhole covers, leading to the adjacent rooms are {{convert|11|ft|m}} tall. Above the doors and along the ceilings are plaster frieze moldings, with modillions interspersed with [[paterae]], that are made from mud, clay, horse hair and Spanish moss. To the right of the entrance hall is the most unusual, and reportedly John Randolph's most favorite room in the house, the White Ballroom. With [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, hand-cast archways and an L-shaped extension into a curved bay, Randolph had it painted completely white, including the flooring, to show off the natural beauty of his seven daughters, six of whom would be married there. Featuring two fireplaces with hand-carved [[rococo]] white marble mantles, there is also an original mirror placed so that the women could see if their ankles or [[Hoop skirt|hoops]] were showing beneath their skirts. Over one of the fireplaces, there is a painting of Mary Henshaw (no relation to the family), whose eyes are said to follow the viewer around the room. Flanking the entrance hall to the left is a gentleman's study, a stair hall and the formal dining room. Both the study and the dining room feature black Italian hand-carved marble mantles on their coal burning fireplaces, and the rooms are filled with period antique furniture. The dining room plasterwork showcases pink camellias, Emily Randolph's favorite flower, and is the only plasterwork in the house to have color.\n\nThe main staircase of Honduran mahogany is covered in green velvet and ascends to the Ancestral Hall on the third-floor. The hall was used by the Randolphs as a family parlor, being a central thoroughfare to many of the adjacent bedrooms, and gave access to the third-floor gallery with views of the Mississippi River. Nearby, is the master bedroom, with one of the three original bathrooms, as well as a small room that was used as a [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] for Julia Marceline, the Randolph's last and only child born at Nottoway. During the Civil War, Emily Randolph utilized a bedpost at the end of the bed to hide valuable jewelry. Though originally bedrooms, one has been made into a music room displaying musical instruments from the 19th-century, and another known as the Wicker Room features wicker furniture originally owned by the Randolph family.\n\nThe first floor basement has been transformed into a restaurant and a small museum about the Randolph family, and the history of the plantation. Originally the space held the laundry, dairy, wine cellar and servants quarters, as well as a 10-pin bowling alley for the amusement of the children.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe landscape for Nottoway was designed by John Nelson of New Orleans whose plan included 120 fruit and citrus trees, 12 magnolia trees, poplar and live oak trees, 75 rose bushes, 150 strawberry plants and a variety of flower and vegetable gardens. However, due to neglect and the erosion of six and a half acres of land by the Mississippi River, the gardens designed by Nelson no longer exist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nottoway's Architectural History|url=https://nottowayplantation.wordpress.com/|publisher=Nottoway Plantation's Blog|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Today, the house sits only 200 feet behind a river levee and the grounds include a small formal hedge garden adjacent to the gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re where the detached kitchen once stood, and a fountain courtyard in front of the southern bedroom wing. Surrounding the house are modern ancillary buildings that house offices and event facilities. The owners expanded the property in 2008 by building a carriage house, ballroom and nine Acadian-style cottages modeled after the property's original slave quarters, while the plantation was closed to the public for repairs, as a result of damage incurred by [[Hurricane Gustav]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Louisiana plantation to be auctioned|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/02/historic-louisiana-plantation-to-be-auctioned/|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> To the north of the house is the reconstructed stables, now re-purposed as a ballroom, and the Randolph cemetery where the remains of the family were reinterred in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nJohn Hampden Randolph was born in [[Virginia]] in 1813, a member of the prominent [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph family]]. He migrated with his family to Mississippi when his father, [[Peter Randolph|Peter Randolph Jr.]], was appointed a federal judge in [[Woodville, Mississippi]], by [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] in 1820.\n\nJohn Randolph married Emily Jane Liddell in 1837 and went on to have eleven children with her. Randolph devoted most of his time to his [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], but believing sugar production would be more lucrative he decided to move his family to southern Louisiana in 1842 where he purchased a {{convert|1650|acre|km2}} cotton plantation that he named Forest Home. Converting the plantation to [[sugar cane]] production two years later and constructing [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville Parish's]] first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[sugar cane mill|sugar mill]], he was able to triple his earnings over his cotton production. Within ten years he had increased his holdings to {{convert|7116|acre|km2}} and owned 176 [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] making Randolph one of the larger slaveholders in the South. In 1855 he purchased an additional {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of highland, and {{convert|620|acre|km2}} of [[swamp]] and Mississippi River-front land where he sought to build a more prestigious home that he named \"Nottoway\", after [[Nottoway County, Virginia|Nottoway County]] in the part of Virginia where he was born.\n\n[[File:Nottoway Plantation-022.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Painting by Cornelia Randolph showing original garden landscape]]\nHe selected Henry Howard, a very popular architect of the time, considered to have been one of the finest architects of 19th-century [[New Orleans]]. Many of his Greek Revival and Italianate style buildings, churches, and homes can still be found in the city.  He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work. The massive home was completed in 1859 along with a variety of other buildings including quarters for enslaved workers, a schoolhouse, greenhouse, stable, steam-powered sugar house, wood cisterns, and other necessary buildings for an agricultural operation.<ref name=\"Nottoway\">{{cite book |title=Nottoway Plantation: The South's Largest Antebellum Mansion |last=Sommers Castaldi |first=Robin |year=2013 |publisher=Nottoway Properties, Inc |isbn=978-0-9891285-0-6 |pages=26\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the house was completed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''. North American Case Research Association (NACRA), 16(3).</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe new owners of Nottoway were D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Pierre Landry and his father-in-law, Jean Baptiste Dugas, whose family owned the plantation until 1909, when Landry's widow sold Nottoway to sugar [[Planter (American South)|planter]] Alfonse Hanlon. Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|km2}} keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house trying to maintain the house with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. Dying in 2003, it was at this time the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.

He also designed the neighboring [[Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)|Belle Grove]], now destroyed.  Randolph and the owner of Belle Grove, John Andrews, are known to have had a rivalry of sorts that even extended to their homes.<ref name=\"lostplan\">{{cite book |title=Lost Plantations of the South |last=Matrana |first=Marc R. |year=2009 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |isbn=978-1-57806-942-2 |pages=184\u2013192 }}</ref> Compiling the materials for his [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation home]], cypress logs were cut and cured under water for six years, then cut into planks and dried into what is called virgin cypress. The wood's most notable feature is not its durability, but its resistance to termites. Handmade bricks were baked in kilns by enslaved workers and 40 carpenters, brick masons and plumbers were hired by Howard, who lived in tents at the site of construction while doing their work. The massive home was completed in 1859 along with a variety of other buildings including quarters for enslaved workers, a schoolhouse, greenhouse, stable, steam-powered sugar house, wood cisterns, and other necessary buildings for an agricultural operation.<ref name=\"Nottoway\">{{cite book |title=Nottoway Plantation: The South's Largest Antebellum Mansion |last=Sommers Castaldi |first=Robin |year=2013 |publisher=Nottoway Properties, Inc |isbn=978-0-9891285-0-6 |pages=26\u201369 }}</ref>\n\nSoon after the house was completed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began. Randolph did not support secession from the Union, but once the war began, backed the war financially and sent his three sons to fight for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], losing his oldest son, Algernon Sidney Randolph, at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]]. With the war coming ever closer to Nottoway, it was decided that Randolph would take 200 enslaved people to [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], and grow cotton there while his wife, Emily, stayed at Nottoway with the youngest children, hoping that their presence would save it from destruction. The plantation was occupied by both [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and Confederate troops and though the grounds were damaged and the animals taken, Nottoway survived the war with only a single [[grapeshot]] to the far left column that did not fall out until 1971.\n\nWith the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] of the slaves, John Randolph contracted with 53 of his former bond people to continue working as laborers. When he returned to Nottoway after the Civil War, most, having few other choices, returned with him. The sugar business was not as profitable after the war and by 1875, Nottoway was reduced to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. John Randolph died at Nottoway on September 8, 1883, leaving the plantation to his wife.\n\nEmily Randolph sold the plantation in 1889 for [[$]]50,000, which she divided equally among her nine surviving children and herself. She died in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in 1904.<ref>Fisher, C. (1996). ''The Nottoway Plantation, Restaurant, and Inn: The White Castle of Louisiana''.

Soon after, Hanlon lost Nottoway to foreclosure in 1913 due to crop failures the previous two years that resulted in tax problems and accrued medical bills by his wife's failing health. Dr. Whyte G. Owen purchased the plantation out of foreclosure in the amount of $10,000.\n\nDr. Owen, one-time Surgeon General of Louisiana, attempted to run the estate as a sugar plantation, but was not successful.  He sold off {{convert|1193|acre|km2}} keeping the house and surrounding property. After his death in 1949, Nottoway was inherited by his son Stanford who lived with his wife Odessa in the house until his death in 1974. Thereafter, Odessa Owen lived alone in the massive house trying to maintain the house with her limited resources. Knowing she was unable to adequately care for the house, Owen sold the plantation to Arlin K. Dease in 1980, who had restored three other antebellum mansions, including the [[Myrtles Plantation]] in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]] with the caveat that she be allowed to live in house until her death. Dying in 2003, it was at this time the house ceased to be a private home. Dease restored Nottoway, working a crew of 40 to 60 men 12 hours a day, and opened the house to the public three months after his purchase. Arlin Dease sold Nottoway to [[Paul Ramsay]] of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985, after he had stayed at the property while in the area for business.<ref name=Nottoway/>\n\n===21st century===\nUnder Ramsay's tenure, Nottoway has become a resort destination.
