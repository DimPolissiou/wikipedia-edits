During his career he won the [[European Cup]], three [[English football champions|English league titles]] and captained his national side.  He scored a goal against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]], which is regularly cited as one of the greatest scored in the competition.\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nGemmill was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]]. His early career at [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] was ruined by a succession of injuries, not least a broken ankle in early 1966.

At the same time, Renton ([[Ewan McGregor]]), who had switched the tapes in their cases and borrowed Tommy and Lizzie's tape, says after [[orgasm|climaxing]] during [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], \"I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against [[Netherlands national football team|Holland]] in 1978!\" Gemmill first saw ''Trainspotting'' on a club outing with [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]], and his reaction was:<ref name = \"BBC interview\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/09/29/archie_gemmill_interview_feature.shtml Archie, Archie Gemmill!], [[BBC]].</ref> \"I got absolutely slaughtered by the lads... to be fair I was a bit embarrassed by it.\"\n\n==After playing==\nGemmill returned to Nottingham Forest to be a coach alongside [[Brian Clough]] in 1984.

Although the coat of arms is not currently shown on flags, the [[Buenos Aires]]-born military leader [[Manuel Belgrano]] ordered to paint it over the flag he gave to the city of [[San Salvador de Jujuy]], and during the [[Argentine War of Independence]] [[Flag of the Andes|most flags had the coat of arms]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coat of arms of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata.svg|thumb|160px|left|Seal of the General Constituent Assembly of 1813.]]\n[[File:Proto-escudo-dibujado.JPG|thumb|160px|left|Seal of a French group in the National Assembly, around 1793.]]\nIt is unknown who designed the coat of arms. It is often mentioned that there were three men involved: Alvear, Monteagudo, and Vieytes, but it is known that a few years before, President [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] asked the Peruvian Antonio Isidoro Castro to create an Argentine coat of arms; however, the two schemes have never been found.\n\nThe coat of arms is a figure, in which at the top we find the gold-yellowed [[Sun of May]], also found on the [[flag of Argentina]]. The rising sun symbolizes the rising of Argentina, as described in the first version of the [[Argentine National Anthem]], ''{{lang|es|se levanta a la faz de la tierra una nueva y gloriosa naci\u00f3n}}'', meaning \"a new and glorious nation rises to the surface of the Earth\". It must be noticed how the verb \"rise\", in English and Spanish can be used to describe the motion of the Sun.\n\nIn the center ellipse there are two shaking hands, connoting the unity of the [[provinces of Argentina]]. The hands come together to hold a pike, which represents power and willingness to defend freedom, epitomized by the [[Phrygian cap]] on the top of the spear.\n\nThe blue and white colors are symbols of the Argentine people and the same colors of the Argentine flag. Those derive from those utilised in the cockade promoting liberation from Spain, in the May Revolution in 1810, which in turn came about from the colours of the Borbonic dynasty.\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = Argentina 1828 8 Escudos.jpg |bSize = 361|cWidth = 175|cHeight = 175|oTop = 5|oLeft = 182|Location = right|Description = Coat of Arms of the General Constituent Assembly of Argentina depicted on the eight escudo gold coin.}}\nThe hands stand for friendship, peace, unity, and brotherhood. The pike is brown (wooden), and the Phrygian cap is red, like the traditional French liberty cap. The proximity of the hands and the Phrygian cap, in addition to their individual meanings, represent the national motto of [[Argentina]], ''{{lang|es|en uni\u00f3n y libertad}}'' (\"in unity and freedom\"), and illustrate the idea that in unity (the hands) there is power (the pike), and in power there is freedom (the Phrygian cap).\n\nThe Phrygian cap was typically worn by the inhabitants of [[Phrygia]], in the Anatolian peninsula, and is commonly mistaken for being a [[Pileus (hat)|Pileus]]. The Pileus was a hat that in ancient Rome became a symbol of freed slaves, who were touched by their owners with a wooden pike before setting them free.\nLaurel is another classical symbol. At the end of the [[ancient Olympic Games]] (and also the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]), the winner was given a laurel crown, and since then it has symbolized triumph and glory.\n\n==Provincial shields==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+<big>Argentina's provincial shields</big>\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

Although the coat of arms is not currently shown on flags, the [[Buenos Aires]]-born military leader [[Manuel Belgrano]] ordered to paint it over the flag he gave to the city of [[San Salvador de Jujuy]], and during the [[Argentine War of Independence]] [[Flag of the Andes|most flags had the coat of arms]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coat of arms of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata.svg|thumb|160px|left|Seal of the General Constituent Assembly of 1813.]]\n[[File:Proto-escudo-dibujado.JPG|thumb|160px|left|Seal of a French group in the National Assembly, around 1793.]]\nIt is unknown who designed the coat of arms. It is often mentioned that there were three men involved: Alvear, Monteagudo, and Vieytes, but it is known that a few years before, President [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] asked the Peruvian Antonio Isidoro Castro to create an Argentine coat of arms; however, the two schemes have never been found.\n\nThe coat of arms is a figure, in which at the top we find the gold-yellowed [[Sun of May]], also found on the [[flag of Argentina]]. The rising sun symbolizes the rising of Argentina, as described in the first version of the [[Argentine National Anthem]], ''{{lang|es|se levanta a la faz de la tierra una nueva y gloriosa naci\u00f3n}}'', meaning \"a new and glorious nation rises to the surface of the Earth\". It must be noticed how the verb \"rise\", in English and Spanish can be used to describe the motion of the Sun.\n\nIn the center ellipse there are two shaking hands, connoting the unity of the [[provinces of Argentina]]. The hands come together to hold a pike, which represents power and willingness to defend freedom, epitomized by the [[Phrygian cap]] on the top of the spear.\n\nThe blue and white colors are symbols of the Argentine people and the same colors of the Argentine flag. Those derive from those utilised in the cockade promoting liberation from Spain, in the May Revolution in 1810, which in turn came about from the colours of the Borbonic dynasty.\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = Argentina 1828 8 Escudos.jpg |bSize = 361|cWidth = 175|cHeight = 175|oTop = 5|oLeft = 182|Location = right|Description = Coat of Arms of the General Constituent Assembly of Argentina depicted on the eight escudo gold coin.}}\nThe hands stand for friendship, peace, unity, and brotherhood. The pike is brown (wooden), and the Phrygian cap is red, like the traditional French liberty cap. The proximity of the hands and the Phrygian cap, in addition to their individual meanings, represent the national motto of [[Argentina]], ''{{lang|es|en uni\u00f3n y libertad}}'' (\"in unity and freedom\"), and illustrate the idea that in unity (the hands) there is power (the pike), and in power there is freedom (the Phrygian cap).\n\nThe Phrygian cap was typically worn by the inhabitants of [[Phrygia]], in the Anatolian peninsula, and is commonly mistaken for being a [[Pileus (hat)|Pileus]]. The Pileus was a hat that in ancient Rome became a symbol of freed slaves, who were touched by their owners with a wooden pike before setting them free.\nLaurel is another classical symbol. At the end of the [[ancient Olympic Games]] (and also the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]), the winner was given a laurel crown, and since then it has symbolized triumph and glory.\n\n==Provincial shields==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|+<big>Argentina's provincial shields</big>\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

The British [[Royal Navy]] captured in August 1795 and took her into service as HMS ''Victorieuse''. She captured several privateers and two forts in the Caribbean and then served briefly in the Mediterranean before she was broken up in 1807.\n\n==French Navy==\nBetween 4 April 1794 and 27 December, ''Victorieuse'', ''lieutenant de vaisseau'' Sala\u00fcn, commanding, was at [[Honfleur]]. She escorted convoys between Dunkirk and points north, returning to [[Ostend]]. Next, she made a transit from Havre to Dunkirk. Lastly, she cruised in the North Sea, returning to Ostend.\n \nFrom 24 April 1795 to 20 June ''Victorieuse'' was still under Sala\u00fcn's command. She was at Dunkirk. Then she cruised in the North Sea. Next she transported personnel from Dunkirk to [[Kristiansand]] and returned from there. She assumed her station in Dunkirk [[roadstead|Roads]].   \n\n'''Capture:''' On 25 August 1795 Admiral [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Duncan's]] squadron captured two French Navy brigs off the Texel: {{ship|French brig|Suffisante|1793|2}} and ''Victorieuse''.

They made for her, seeking to take her by boarding. One was a schooner of 12 guns and 80 men, and the other a sloop of 6 guns and 51 men. ''Victorieuse'' engaged them, forcing the sloop st [[striking the colours|strike]] as she was so damaged that she was in danger of sinking. The schooner then fled; Dickson believed that she too was damaged and had suffered heavy casualties. ''Victorieuse'' did not pursue as she was unwilling to leave the convoy. The captured sloop turned out to be ''Brutus'', of Guadeloupe. She was under the command of Citizen Roufel and was 10 days out of Guadeloupe but had not taken anything. She had had four men killed and four wounded before she struck. ''Victorieuse'' had no casualties.<ref>{{London Gazette|date=23 June 1798|issue=15035|page=572}}</ref>\n\n*20 June: ''Victorieuse'' captured ''Trois Couleurs'' off Trinidad.

''Victorieuse'' sailed in company with {{HMS|Zephyr|1795|2}}. They also had on board a detachment of 40 men from the Royal Rangers. On 2 December ''Victorieuse''  destroyed the Dutch privateer ''Proserpine'', from [[Cura\u00e7ao|Caracoa]], on Cape Three Points on the Spanish Main. ''Proserpine'' was armed with two guns and had a crew of 15 men. At 2am on 3 December Dickson landed the troops and some seamen to attack the fort at Rio Caribe from the rear, while ''Victorieuse'' and ''Zephyr'' attacked from the front. At daylight the fort's commander sent word that he would surrender the fort without resisting. The landing party took away the fort's guns and reembarked. The British then arrived off Gurupano at 4pm, where they found a French privateer in the harbour. The Spanish commander of the two forts refused to surrender and stated that he would protect the privateer. At 5pm the Rangers landed, together with 30 seamen from the brigs. The landing party attacked the forts from the rear while the brigs came up and fired on the front. The landing party took the lower fort within 10 minutes. The upper fort was taken in five minutes. The landing party of 70 men had overcome some 300 defenders. The brigs also took possession of the French privateer, which was armed with six guns and had a crew of 80 men.

''Victorieuse'' sailed in company with {{HMS|Zephyr|1795|2}}. They also had on board a detachment of 40 men from the Royal Rangers.

''Proserpine'' was armed with two guns and had a crew of 15 men. At 2am on 3 December Dickson landed the troops and some seamen to attack the fort at Rio Caribe from the rear, while ''Victorieuse'' and ''Zephyr'' attacked from the front. At daylight the fort's commander sent word that he would surrender the fort without resisting. The landing party took away the fort's guns and reembarked. The British then arrived off Gurupano at 4pm, where they found a French privateer in the harbour. The Spanish commander of the two forts refused to surrender and stated that he would protect the privateer. At 5pm the Rangers landed, together with 30 seamen from the brigs. The landing party attacked the forts from the rear while the brigs came up and fired on the front. The landing party took the lower fort within 10 minutes. The upper fort was taken in five minutes. The landing party of 70 men had overcome some 300 defenders. The brigs also took possession of the French privateer, which was armed with six guns and had a crew of 80 men.

The series was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in its first four seasons, and by [[Cartoon Network Studios]] in its final two seasons. It centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three [[kindergarten]]-aged girls with [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. The girls all live in the fictional city of Townsville with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, and are frequently called upon by the city's mayor to help fight nearby criminals and other enemies using their powers.\n\nMcCracken originally developed the show in 1992 as a cartoon short entitled Whoopass Stew! while in his second year at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]. Following a name change, Cartoon Network featured the first Powerpuff Girls pilots in its animation showcase program [[What a Cartoon!]] in 1995 and 1996. The series premiered on November 18, 1998 and ended on March 25, 2005. Excluding the two pilot shorts, the series ran for a total of six seasons, totaling 78 episodes. In addition, a [[The Powerpuff Girls Movie|feature film]] was released in July 2002 and a Christmas special aired in December 2003. Two additional specials were made: a tenth-anniversary special , aired in 2008, and a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] special, aired in 2014, the latter of which was made without McCracken's input.\n\nVarious spin-off media include an [[Powerpuff Girls Z|anime]], three CD soundtracks, a home video collection, comic books, a [[List of The Powerpuff Girls video games|series of video games]], a [[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|2016 reboot series]], as well as various licensed merchandise. The series has been nominated for six [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], nine [[Annie Award]]s, and a [[Kids' Choice Award]] during its run.\n\nIt was the last cartoon produced in [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Studios]], which was closed in [[2001]] after [[William Hanna]]'s death.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show revolves around the adventures of three kindergarten aged girls with an array of various [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard [[superhero]] and [[tokusatsu]] shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from [[villain]]s and giant [[monster movie|monsters]]. In addition, the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Moral Decay|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12A}}</ref> personal hygiene,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Down 'n' Dirty|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=September 10, 1999|season=2|number=5B}}</ref> going to school, [[Nocturnal enuresis|bed wetting]],<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pee Pee G's|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=November 13, 2003|season=5|number=6A}}</ref> or dependence on a [[security blanket]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Cover Up|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=May 26, 2000|season=2|number=11B}}</ref> Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode \"Meet the Beat Alls\",<ref>{{cite episode|title=Meet the Beat-Alls|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12B}}</ref> which is a homage to [[the Beatles]]).

Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.''\n* Blossom (voiced by [[Cathy Cavadini]], [[Grey Delisle]]) is the self-proclaimed leader of the Powerpuff Girls. Her personality ingredient is \"everything nice\", her signature color is pink, and she has long strawberry blonde hair with a red bow.<ref name=\"CN\"/><!--CN source describes her hair as \"fiery red\" not orange--> She was named for having spoken freely and honestly to the Professor shortly after her creation as shown in ''The Powerpuff Girls Movie''. She is often seen as the most level-headed, and composed member of the group and also strong and determined. Her unique abilities include \"Ice Breath\" (develops in \"Ice Sore\"), microscopic vision, and advanced intelligence; she is also a master strategist and apt planner.\n* Bubbles (voiced by [[Tara Strong]], credited as [[Tara Strong|Tara Charendoff]], in the series and by [[Kath Soucie]] in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is the \"softest and sweetest\" of the three.<ref name=\"CN\"/> Her signature color is blue, her personality ingredient is \"sugar\", and she has blonde hair in pigtails. Bubbles is seen as kind and very sweet but she is also capable of extreme rage and can fight monsters just as well as her sisters can. Her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls \"Octi\", and she also loves animals. She exhibits the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals, and her unique power is emitting supersonic waves.\n* Buttercup (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is described as a \"tough hotheaded tomboy\".<ref name=\"CN\"/> Her personality ingredient is \"spice\", her signature color is green, and she has black hair in a flip.

The series was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in its first four seasons, and by [[Cartoon Network Studios]] in its final two seasons. It centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three [[kindergarten]]-aged girls with [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. The girls all live in the fictional city of Townsville with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, and are frequently called upon by the city's mayor to help fight nearby criminals and other enemies using their powers.\n\nMcCracken originally developed the show in 1992 as a cartoon short entitled Whoopass Stew! while in his second year at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]. Following a name change, Cartoon Network featured the first Powerpuff Girls pilots in its animation showcase program [[What a Cartoon!]] in 1995 and 1996. The series premiered on November 18, 1998 and ended on March 25, 2005. Excluding the two pilot shorts, the series ran for a total of six seasons, totaling 78 episodes. In addition, a [[The Powerpuff Girls Movie|feature film]] was released in July 2002 and a Christmas special aired in December 2003. Two additional specials were made: a tenth-anniversary special , aired in 2008, and a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] special, aired in 2014, the latter of which was made without McCracken's input.\n\nVarious spin-off media include an [[Powerpuff Girls Z|anime]], three CD soundtracks, a home video collection, comic books, a [[List of The Powerpuff Girls video games|series of video games]], a [[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|2016 reboot series]], as well as various licensed merchandise. The series has been nominated for six [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], nine [[Annie Award]]s, and a [[Kids' Choice Award]] during its run.\n\nIt was the last cartoon produced in [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Studios]], which was closed in [[2001]] after [[William Hanna]]'s death.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show revolves around the adventures of three kindergarten aged girls with an array of various [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard [[superhero]] and [[tokusatsu]] shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from [[villain]]s and giant [[monster movie|monsters]]. In addition, the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Moral Decay|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12A}}</ref> personal hygiene,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Down 'n' Dirty|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=September 10, 1999|season=2|number=5B}}</ref> going to school, [[Nocturnal enuresis|bed wetting]],<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pee Pee G's|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=November 13, 2003|season=5|number=6A}}</ref> or dependence on a [[security blanket]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Cover Up|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=May 26, 2000|season=2|number=11B}}</ref> Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode \"Meet the Beat Alls\",<ref>{{cite episode|title=Meet the Beat-Alls|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12B}}</ref> which is a homage to [[the Beatles]]).

The closing theme to the cartoon offers a nutshell description of the three Powerpuff Girls' personalities: ''Blossom, commander and the leader. Bubbles, she is the joy and the laughter. Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.''\n* Blossom (voiced by [[Cathy Cavadini]]) is the self-proclaimed leader of the Powerpuff Girls. Her personality ingredient is \"everything nice\", her signature color is pink, and she has long strawberry blonde hair with a red bow.<ref name=\"CN\"/><!--CN source describes her hair as \"fiery red\" not orange--> She was named for having spoken freely and honestly to the Professor shortly after her creation as shown in ''The Powerpuff Girls Movie''. She is often seen as the most level-headed, and composed member of the group and also strong and determined. Her unique abilities include \"Ice Breath\" (develops in \"Ice Sore\"), microscopic vision, and advanced intelligence; she is also a master strategist and apt planner.\n* Bubbles (voiced by [[Tara Strong]], credited as [[Tara Strong|Tara Charendoff]], in the series and by [[Kath Soucie]] in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is the \"softest and sweetest\" of the three.<ref name=\"CN\"/> Her signature color is blue, her personality ingredient is \"sugar\", and she has blonde hair in pigtails. Bubbles is seen as kind and very sweet but she is also capable of extreme rage and can fight monsters just as well as her sisters can. Her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls \"Octi\", and she also loves animals. She exhibits the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals, and her unique power is emitting supersonic waves.\n* Buttercup (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is described as a \"tough hotheaded tomboy\".<ref name=\"CN\"/> Her personality ingredient is \"spice\", her signature color is green, and she has black hair in a flip. She loves to get dirty, fights hard and plays rough; she does not plan and is all action.<ref name=\"CN\"/> Buttercup is the only Powerpuff Girl without any unique superpowers (aside from being able to curl her tongue as shown in the episode \"Nuthin' Special\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-powerpuff-girls-2005/episode-15-season-6/nuthin-special/194523|title=Nuthin' Special Episode|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=May 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306081804/http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-powerpuff-girls-2005/episode-15-season-6/nuthin-special/194523|archive-date=March 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> McCracken originally wanted to name the character \"Bud\" until a friend suggested the name Buttercup.<ref name=\"ppgdocumentary\"/>\n\nTheir main arch-enemies throughout the show are a villain by the name of Mojo Jojo (voiced by [[Roger L.

Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, they turn to Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there to help make people like them again.

through the bite of triatomine bugs, also called \"kissing bugs\".<ref name=\"Bern2015\"/> At the bite site, motile {{nowrap|''T. cruzi''}} forms called trypomastigotes invade various host cells.<ref name=CDC/> Inside a host cell, the parasite transforms into a replicative form called an amastigote, which undergoes several rounds of replication.<ref name=CDC/> The now-replicated amastigotes transform back into trypomastigotes, which burst the host cell and are released into the bloodstream.<ref name=\"Molina2018\"/> Trypomastigotes then disseminate throughout the body to various tissues, where they invade cells and replicate.<ref name=\"Molina2018\"/> Over many years, cycles of parasite replication and immune response can severely damage these tissues, particularly the heart and

The player has potential access to a variety of weapons ranging from AR's, SMG's, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc. All of these weapons, adjacent to other shooter games, are effective at various ranges dependent upon several variables like player position and distance from the enemy. Weapon effectiveness and functionality is heavily dependent upon the attachments and mods that the player installs on the weapon, such as sights and barrel attachments. The major difference between the combat in ''Escape from Tarkov'' and other FPS games is how damage is dealt. Instead of a standard health bar, players take damage to different areas and limbs of the body. Depending on the weapon type and the damage dealt, various status effects can be applied to a player's limbs that drastically effect how the PC moves and functions such as fractures and bleeding. Damage can be effectively avoided depending on player movement and gear. Body armor can protect certain areas of the body and leaning mechanics can allow a player to reduce their visible hit box to the enemy.\nObservers find ''Escape from Tarkov''<nowiki/>'s hardcore combat to be similar to that of [[Bohemia Interactive|Bohemia Interactive's]] [[ARMA (series)|''ARMA'']].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Escape from Tarkov'' is set in the fictional city of Tarkov, the capital of the Norvinsk [[Special economic zone|Special Economic Zone]] in [[Northwest Russia|Northwestern Russia]] between the year 2015 and 2026.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://unity.com/madewith/escape-from-tarkov|title=Escape from Tarkov by Battlestate Games - A shooter {{!}} Made with Unity|last=|first=|date=|website=Unity Technologies|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Political scandals and collapse of corruptions have resulted in the social breakdown of Tarkov and warring factions have turned the city into a shell of itself with sections of the city being under control of aggressive locals called \"scavs.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> As of March 2020, players can play across seven of the game's playable locations all within Tarkov: Factory, Customs, Woods, Shoreline, Interchange, The Lab, and Reserve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dexerto.com/escape-from-tarkov/all-escape-from-tarkov-maps-and-extraction-points-guide-1309294|title=All Escape from Tarkov maps and extraction points guide|website=Dexerto.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Streets of Tarkov as of March 2020 is a location under development and is planned to become the next playable location in the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.futuregamereleases.com/2020/01/battlestate-games-shares-eft-streets-of-tarkov-concept/|title=Battlestate Games Shares EFT's \"Streets of Tarkov\" Environment Concept Art|date=2020-01-31|website=Future Game Releases|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> The expected release date of Streets of Tarkov is April 20 2020.

The player has potential access to a variety of weapons ranging from AR's, SMG's, shotguns, sniper rifles, etc. All of these weapons, adjacent to other shooter games, are effective at various ranges dependent upon several variables like player position and distance from the enemy. Weapon effectiveness and functionality is heavily dependent upon the attachments and mods that the player installs on the weapon, such as sights and barrel attachments. The major difference between the combat in ''Escape from Tarkov'' and other FPS games is how damage is dealt. Instead of a standard health bar, players take damage to different areas and limbs of the body. Depending on the weapon type and the damage dealt, various status effects can be applied to a player's limbs that drastically effect how the PC moves and functions such as fractures and bleeding. Damage can be effectively avoided depending on player movement and gear. Body armor can protect certain areas of the body and leaning mechanics can allow a player to reduce their visible hit box to the enemy.\nObservers find ''Escape from Tarkov''<nowiki/>'s hardcore combat to be similar to that of [[Bohemia Interactive|Bohemia Interactive's]] [[ARMA (series)|''ARMA'']].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Escape from Tarkov'' is set in the fictional city of Tarkov, the capital of the Norvinsk [[Special economic zone|Special Economic Zone]] in [[Northwest Russia|Northwestern Russia]] between the year 2015 and 2026.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://unity.com/madewith/escape-from-tarkov|title=Escape from Tarkov by Battlestate Games - A shooter {{!}} Made with Unity|last=|first=|date=|website=Unity Technologies|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Political scandals and collapse of corruptions have resulted in the social breakdown of Tarkov and warring factions have turned the city into a shell of itself with sections of the city being under control of aggressive locals called \"scavs.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> As of March 2020, players can play across seven of the game's playable locations all within Tarkov: Factory, Customs, Woods, Shoreline, Interchange, The Lab, and Reserve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dexerto.com/escape-from-tarkov/all-escape-from-tarkov-maps-and-extraction-points-guide-1309294|title=All Escape from Tarkov maps and extraction points guide|website=Dexerto.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Streets of Tarkov as of March 2020 is a location under development and is planned to become the next playable location in the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.futuregamereleases.com/2020/01/battlestate-games-shares-eft-streets-of-tarkov-concept/|title=Battlestate Games Shares EFT's \"Streets of Tarkov\" Environment Concept Art|date=2020-01-31|website=Future Game Releases|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> The expected release date of Streets of Tarkov is April 20 2020.
