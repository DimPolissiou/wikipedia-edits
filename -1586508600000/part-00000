London: Routledge, 1994.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Rocinha road 2010.JPG|thumb|300px|Funk carioca was born in the 1980s in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[favela]]s.]]\n\nFunk carioca was once a direct derivative of [[Samba]], [[Afrobeat]], [[Miami bass]], [[Latin music]], [[Traditional African religions|traditional African religious]] music, [[Candomble]], [[Hip-Hop]] and [[Freestyle music|freestyle]] (another Miami-based genre) music from the [[Music of the United States|United States]]. The reason why these genres, very localized in the US, became popular and influential in Rio de Janeiro is due to proximity. Miami was a popular plane stop for Rio DJs to buy the latest American records. Along with the Miami influence came the longtime influence of the [[slave trade]] in [[Colonial Brazil]]. Various African Religions like [[Vodun]], and [[Candomble]] were brought with the enslaved Africans to the [[Americas]]. The same beat is found in Afro-Religious music in the [[African Diaspora]] and many black Brazilians identify as being part of this religion. This genre of music was mainly started by those in [[black communities]] in Brazil, therefore a boiling pot of influences to derive the trademark.\n\nMany similar types of music genres can be found in [[Caribbean]] island nations such as; [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Barbados]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], among others. [[Bounce music]], which originates from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], also has a similar beat. New Orleans, originally a French territory, was a hub for [[Atlantic slave trade]] before it was sold to the [[United States]]. All of these areas with similar music genres retain the influence of American [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[African music]] and [[Latin music]].<ref name=\"Eyes On Brazil\">{{cite web|author=tudobeleza |url=http://eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/origins-of-funk-carioca/ |title=Origins of Funk Carioca &#124; Eyes On Brazil |publisher=Eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, nightclubs in Rio de Janeiro played [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] music.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Raphael Berr\u00eado (August 09, 2012).

G1.</ref>\n\nFunk carioca was popularized in the 1980s in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[favela]]s, the city's predominantly [[Afro-Brazilian]] slums. From the mid-1990s on, it was a mainstream phenomenon in Brazil. Funk songs discuss topics as varied as poverty, [[human dignity]], [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]] of [[black people]], [[sex]], [[violence]], and [[social injustice]]. Social analysts believe that funk carioca is a genuine expression of the severe social issues that burden the poor and black people in Rio.\n\nAccording to DJ Marlboro, the main influence for the emergence of funk carioca was the single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" by [[Afrika Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force]], released in 1982.<ref>Carlos Albuquerque (September 12, 2012).

The most common drum beat was a loop of DJ Battery Brain's \"808 volt\", commonly referred to as \"Voltmix\", though Hassan's \"Pump Up the Party\" is also notable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/pt_br/article/rjm9ak/a-historia-do-tamborzao-a-levada-que-deu-cara-ao-ritmo-do-funk-carioca|title=A Hist\u00f3ria do \u2018Tamborz\u00e3o\u2019, a Levada Que Deu Cara ao Ritmo do Funk Carioca|first=Eduardo|last=Ribeiro|date=August 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0020-38742014000100009#nt105|title=A Era Lula/Tamborz\u00e3o pol\u00edtica e sonoridade|first1=Guillermo|last1=Caceres|first2=Lucas|last2=Ferrari|first3=Carlos|last3=Palombini|date=June 6, 2014|journal=Revista do Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros|issue=58|pages=157\u2013207|via=SciELO|doi=10.11606/issn.2316-901X.v0i58p157-207}}</ref><ref name=\"Tamborz\u00e3o\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZhwcFJ_aw |title=TAMBORZ\u00c3O baile funk beats (english version) |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Nowadays, carioca funk rhythms are mostly based on tamborz\u00e3o rhythms instead of the older drum machine loops.\n\nMelodies are usually sampled. Older songs typically chopped up freestyle samples for the melody, or had none at all. Modern funk uses a set of samples from various sources, notably horn and accordion [[stab (music)|stabs]], as well as the horn intro to the \"[[Rocky]]\" theme. Funk carioca has always used a small catalog of rhythms and samples that almost all songs take from (commonly with several in the same song). Funk carioca songs can either be instrumental or include rapping, singing, or something in between the two. Popularized by Brazilians and other [[Afro-Latino]] people, the saying \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Bum Cha-Cha\" , \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Cha Cha\" or even \"Boom-Pop-Pop, Pop,Pop\" is a representation of the beat that comes along in most funk songs with the origin of this beat derived from Central and West African music.\n<ref name=\"pitchforkmedia.com\"/><ref name=\"riofunk.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908162256/http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-date=2006-09-08 |url-status=dead |title=RIOFUNK.org - INFORMATION ABOUT BAILE FUNK !!! |accessdate=2014-06-12 }}</ref>\n\nFunk Carioca is different from the funk originated in the United States. Starting in 1970, styles like ''bailes da pesada,'' ''black soul'', ''shaft'', and ''funk'' started to emerge in Rio de Janeiro. As time went on, DJ's started to look for other rhythms of black music, but the original name did not remain.  The term ''baile funk'' is used to refer to the parties in which Funk Carioca is played. Funk Carioca first emerged and is played throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro, but not only in the city of Rio, like Rio natives like to believe. Funk Carioca is mostly appealing to the youth. In the decade of 1980, anthropologist Herman Vianna was the first social scientist to take Funk as an object to study in his Masters thesis, which gave origin to the book  ''O Mundo Funk Carioca'', which translates to ''The Carioca Funk World''(1988). During that decade, funk dances lost a bit of popularity due to the emergence of [[disco music]], a [[pop music|pop]] version of [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]], especially after the release of the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) starring [[John Travolta]] and with soundtrack of the band [[Bee Gees]]. At the time, the then teenager, Fernando Lu\u00eds Mattos da Matta was interested in the discotheque when listening to the program Cidade Disco Club on Radio City of Rio de Janeiro (102.9 FM). Years later Fernando would adopt the nickname of [[DJ Marlboro]] and the radio would be known as the Rio \"[[rock music|rock]] radio\u201d.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nThere are a number of variants derived from funk carioca.\n\n=== Funk melody ===\n{{Main|Funk melody}}\nFunk Melody is based on Electro rhythms but with a romantic lyrical approach<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Medeiros | first1 = Jana\u00edna | title = Funk carioca: crime ou cultura? | publisher = Terceiro Nome | isbn = 9788587556745 | page = 19}} </ref>. It has been noted for being powered by female artists. The popular Funk melody singers are Perlla, Babi and Copacabana Beat.\n\n=== Proibid\u00e3o ===\n{{Main | Proibid\u00e3o}}\nProibid\u00e3o is a derivative of Rio de Janeiro funk related to prohibited practices. The content of the genre involves the sale of illegal drugs and the war against police agencies, as well as the glorification and praise of the drug cartels, similar to gangsta rap.\n\n=== Funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o ===\n{{Main|Funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o}}\nFunk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o is a sub-genre of Rio de Janeiro funk created in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 2008. The lyrical and thematic content of songs in this style focuses mainly on conspicuous consumption, as well as a focus on materialistic activities, glorification of style of urban life and ambitions to leave the favela. Since then, funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o has been strongly associated with the emerging '' nova classe m\u00e9dia '' (new [[middle class]]) in Brazil<ref> {{Cite news | url = http://g1.globo.com/globo-news/noticia/2013/11/funk-ostentacao-simboliza-em-sp-emergencia-da-nova-classe-media.html|title=Funk Ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o symbolizes in SP emergeg\u00eancia da 'nova classe m\u00e9dia' | date = November 10, 2013 | work = Globo News | access-date = April 2, 2017 | language = pt-BR}} </ref>.\n\n=== Funk paulista ===\nFunk paulista, also known as '''funk ousadia''', is a style originating from funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o, in the early 2013's. The genre was mainly promoted by the Brazilian audiovisual content channel [[KondZilla]], which spelled names like MC Jo\u00e3o, MC Kevinho , MC Zaac, Jerry Smith and [[MC Fioti]]. The theme of the songs changes from ostentation to a more dancing approach ('''new funk''').\n\n=== Pagofunk ===\nA sub-genre of funk paulista, pagofunk is known for the use of ''[[sampler (musical instrument)| samplers]]'' by [[cavaco]] (a typical instrument of [[Pagode]]), typical rhythms of [[hip hop]]/[[Trap music|Trap]] and controversial lyrics. The songs of great repercussion of the genre are \"Tudo de Bom\", by MC Livinho, \"Turumtumtum\", \"[[Olha a Explos\u00e3o]]\", by MC Kevinho, \"[[Todo Dia]]\", by [[Pabllo Vittar]] and Rico Dalassam, and \"N\u00e3o Encosta\", by [[Ludmilla (singer)|Ludmilla]].\n\n=== Raggafunk ===\nThe genre, created by [[DJ Marlboro]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zonasuburbana.com.br/dj-marlboro-cria-genero-ragafunk-em-novo-projeto/|title=DJ Marlboro cria g\u00eanero Ragafunk em novo projeto|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> emerged in the context of the third [[funk melody]] generation ([[Rio de Janeiro]] and, rarely, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[2010]]), represented by artists such as [[Ludmilla (singer)|Ludmilla]], [[Melody (Brazilian singer)|MC Melody]], [[Biel (singer)|MC Biel]] and [[Valesca Popozuda]].\nIn this generation, funk melody was mixed with music [[Pop music|pop]] and electronic rhythms ([[electropop]]) initially, but, with the rise of Latin rhythms in the music industry, funk began to mix elements from genres like [[ragga]], [[reggae]], [[reggaeton]] and [[kuduro]].\n\n=== Rave funk ===\nIt's a mix of funk and [[Beat (music)|beat]] [[electronic music|electronic]], created in 2016 by DJ GBR<ref> {{Cite news | url = https://kondzilla.com/m/como-dj-gbr-e - dj-tezinho-criaram-o-projeto-rave-dos-fluxos/ # materia | title = Five funk-rave explodes dance to us voc\u00ea conhecer | date = December 7, 2019 | work = Kondzilla | access-date = 13 February 2020 | language = pt-BR}} </ref>.\n\n=== Brega funk ===\nThe melody mixes [[brega]], [[ax\u00e9|pagod\u00e3o]], [[arrocha]] and funk carioca.

Then the [[Europe]]an media began to report its peculiar combination of music, social issues with a strong sexual appeal (often pornographic).\n\nIn 2001, for the first time, funk carioca tracks appeared on a non-Brazilian label. One example is the album ''[[Favela Chic]]'', released by [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. It contained three old-school funk carioca hits, including the song \"[[Popozuda Rock n' Roll]]\" by De Falla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Favela-Chic-Funk-Favela/release/1352224 |title=Various - Favela Chic: Funk Favela |publisher=discogs |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:M.i.a.1.jpg|thumb|200px|Artist [[M.I.A.

Many funk carioca artists started to do shows abroad at that time. [[DJ Marlboro]] and [[Favela Chic Paris]] club were the pioneer travelers and producers. The funk carioca production was until then limited to playing in the [[ghetto]]s and the Brazilian pop market. DJ Marlboro,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.uol.com.br/bigmix/djmarlboro.html | title = \u00c9 BIG MIX O MAN\u00c9}}</ref> a major composer of funk carioca's tunes declared in 2006 in the Brazilian [[Istok (magazine)|Isto \u00c9 magazine]] how astonished he was with the sudden overseas interest in the genre. He would go on to travel in over 10 European countries.\n\nIn [[London]], duo [[Tetine]] assembled a compilation album called [[Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca]]'','' which was released by [[Mr Bongo Records]] in 2004. Tetine also ran the weekly radio show [[Slum Dunk]] on London's radio art station [[Resonance FM|Resonance Fm 104.4]]. Their radio show was entirely dedicated to funk carioca and worked as a platform for the duo to produce and organize a series of film programs as well as interviews and gigs involving funk carioca artists from Rio. Tetine were also responsible for the first screening of the [[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] documentary [[Eu Sou Feia Mas T\u00f4 Na Moda]] by filmmaker [[Denise Garcia]] which was co-produced by Tetine in London and first shown in the city at the [[Slum Dunk Film Program]] at [[Brady Arts Centre]] in East London in March 2005. Apart from this, Tetine also produced two albums with experimental DIY [[queer]] funk carioca: ''[[Bonde do Tet\u00e3o]]'', released by Brazilian label [[Bizarre Records]] in 2004, and ''[[L.I.C.K My Favela]]'', released by [[Kute Bash Records]] in 2005. Tetine also recorded with [[Deize Tigrona]] on the track \"I Go to the Doctor\", included in the LP ''L.I.C.K My Favela'' in 2005 and later on their album ''[[Let Your X's Be Y's]]'', released by [[Soul Jazz Records]] in 2008.\n\nIn Italy, [[Irma Records]] released the 2005 compilation [[Colors Music#4: Rio Funk|Colors Music #4: Rio Funk]]. Many small labels (notably European label [[Arcade Mode]] and [[United States|American]] labels [[Flamin\u00b4Hotz]] and Nossa) labels released several compilations and EPs in bootleg formats.\n\nThe artist [[M.I.A.

The [[Sexism|degradation of women]] as objects for sex is a recurring theme in funk carioca. Girls are called \"cachorras\" (whores) and \"popozudas\" - large buttocks, and many songs revolve around casual and degrading sex practices with them. \"Novinhas\" (young/underaged girls) as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] are also a frequent theme in funk carioca songs.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-zq-sspQo |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Some of these songs, however, are sung by women.\n\nThe extreme banalization of sex and the incitement of [[promiscuity]] is viewed as a negative aspect of the funk carioca culture. Besides the moral considerations, in favelas, where sanitary conditions are poor and [[sex education]] low, this might lead to [[public health]] and social issues. In such communities, definitive [[Birth control|contraceptive methods]] are hardly available and due to lack of education and awareness, [[family planning]] is close to nonexistent. This environment results in unwanted pregnancies, population overgrowth, and eventually the growth of the communities ([[faveliza\u00e7\u00e3o]]).<ref name=\"www1.folha.uol.com.br\">{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u128489.shtml |title=Folha Online - Cotidiano - Atlas aponta natalidade maior que a m\u00e9dia em favelas da Grande SP - 22/11/2006 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref><ref name=\"rjtv.globo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://rjtv.globo.com/Jornalismo/RJTV/0,,MUL131124-9097,00.html |title=G1 \u2013 Rio de Janeiro: not\u00edcias e v\u00eddeos da Globo |publisher=Rjtv.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Glamour (presentation)|glamor]]ization of [[criminality]] in the favelas is also frequently viewed as another negative consequence of funk carioca.

Its themes include praising the murders of rival gang members and cops, intimidating opposers, claiming power over the favelas, robbery, drug use and the illicit life of drug dealers in general.

It has been rumored that most of the funk projects in favelas are also financially backed by drug lords, so many song lyrics deal with challenging the police together with a subversive nature to the law currently established in Brazil.\n\n===Response===\nDefenders of funk carioca argue that the genre is an authentic expression of the culture of [[Afro-Brazilian]] communities, and the lyrics of a sexual nature reflect the sexual freedom found in Brazilian society.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Surra de Bunda]]\n* [[Miami bass]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1569728,00.html \"Ghetto Fabulous\" Observer Music Monthly article on Baile Funk by Alex Bellos 2005]\n* [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1166677,00.html \"Samba, That's So Last Year\" article by Alex Bellos at The Guardian 2004]\n* [http://www.thefreeradical.ca/in_the_fight_clubs_of_rio_monday.htm \"In The Fight Club Of Rio\" article on \"corridor balls\" at Free Radical by Canadian Nicole Veash 2000]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080602043605/http://musibrasil.net/articolo.php?id=1915 Article with Baile Funk master Sany Pitbull by Sabrina Fidalgo at Musibrasil 2007]\n* [https://xlr8r.com/features/the-funk-phenomenon/ \"The Funk Phenomenon\" article by Bruno Natal at XLR8R magazine 2005]\n* [http://www.proibidao.org/funk-carioca-and-musica-soul/ ''Funk Carioca'' and ''M\u00fasica Soul'' by Carlos Palombini]\n{{Hip Hop}}\n{{Lusophonemusic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Funk Carioca}}\n[[Category:Brazilian styles of music]]\n[[Category:Funk carioca| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Primary sources|date=May 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox music genre\n|name=Funk carioca\n|stylistic_origins= {{hlist|[[Miami bass]]|[[electro-funk]]|[[gangsta rap]]|[[Freestyle music|freestyle]]}}\n|cultural_origins= Mid-1980s, [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil\n|instruments= {{hlist|[[Drum machine]]|[[turntabalism|turntable]]|[[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]|[[synthesizer]]|[[rapping]]}}\n|derivatives=\n|subgenres= {{hlist|[[Proibid\u00e3o]]|[[melodic funk]]|[[funk ostenta\u00e7\u00e3o|funk paulista]]}}\n|fusiongenres=\n|regional_scenes=\n|bgcolor=darkblue\n|color=white\n|popularity= Large mid-1990s and current in [[Brazil]], Moderate mid-2000s in [[Eastern Europe]].\n|subgenrelist=\n|other_topics}}\n\n'''Funk carioca''' {{IPA-pt|\u02c8f\u0250\u0303.ki \u02ccka.\u027ei.\u02c8\u0254.k\u0250|}}, also known as '''favela funk''' and, in other parts in the world, '''baile funk''', is a hip hop style from [[Rio de Janeiro]], derived from [[Miami bass]] and [[gangsta rap]] music.<ref name=\"pitchforkmedia.com\">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16784-rio-baile-funk-favela-booty-beats/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407001434/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16784-rio-baile-funk-favela-booty-beats/ |date=April 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Frere |first=Sasha |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/01/050801crmu_music?currentPage=1 |title=Brazilian Wax |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\n\"Baile funk\", in Brazil, refers not to the music, but to the actual [[Dance party|parties]] or [[discotheque]]s in which the music is played ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8baj.l\u026f}}, from ''baile'', meaning \"dance [event]\").<ref name=\"FavelaFunk\">[http://www.favelafunk.net/Batidao_do_Funk.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118195119/http://www.favelafunk.net/Batidao_do_Funk.htm |date=November 18, 2008 }}</ref> Although originated in Rio, funk [[carioca]] has become increasingly popular amongst working classes in other parts of Brazil.

The reason why these genres, very localized in the US, became popular and influential in Rio de Janeiro is due to proximity. Miami was a popular plane stop for Rio DJs to buy the latest American records. Along with the Miami influence came the longtime influence of the [[slave trade]] in [[Colonial Brazil]]. Various African Religions like [[Vodun]], and [[Candomble]] were brought with the enslaved Africans to the [[Americas]]. The same beat is found in Afro-Religious music in the [[African Diaspora]] and many black Brazilians identify as being part of this religion. This genre of music was mainly started by those in [[black communities]] in Brazil, therefore a boiling pot of influences to derive the trademark.\n\nMany similar types of music genres can be found in [[Caribbean]] island nations such as; [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Barbados]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], among others. [[Bounce music]], which originates from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], also has a similar beat. New Orleans, originally a French territory, was a hub for [[Atlantic slave trade]] before it was sold to the [[United States]]. All of these areas with similar music genres retain the influence of American [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[African music]] and [[Latin music]].<ref name=\"Eyes On Brazil\">{{cite web|author=tudobeleza |url=http://eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/origins-of-funk-carioca/ |title=Origins of Funk Carioca &#124; Eyes On Brazil |publisher=Eyesonbrazil.wordpress.com |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, nightclubs in Rio de Janeiro played [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] music.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Raphael Berr\u00eado (August 09, 2012).

G1.</ref>\n\nFunk carioca was popularized in the 1980s in [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[favela]]s, the city's predominantly [[Afro-Brazilian]] slums. From the mid-1990s on, it was a mainstream phenomenon in Brazil. Funk songs discuss topics as varied as poverty, [[human dignity]], [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]] of [[black people]], [[sex]], [[violence]], and [[social injustice]]. Social analysts believe that funk carioca is a genuine expression of the severe social issues that burden the poor and black people in Rio.\n\nAccording to DJ Marlboro, the main influence for the emergence of funk carioca was the single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" by [[Afrika Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force]], released in 1982.<ref>Carlos Albuquerque (September 12, 2012).

Older songs typically chopped up freestyle samples for the melody, or had none at all. Modern funk uses a set of samples from various sources, notably horn and accordion [[stab (music)|stabs]], as well as the horn intro to the \"[[Rocky]]\" theme. Funk carioca has always used a small catalog of rhythms and samples that almost all songs take from (commonly with several in the same song). Funk carioca songs can either be instrumental or include rapping, singing, or something in between the two. Popularized by Brazilians and other [[Afro-Latino]] people, the saying \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Bum Cha-Cha\" , \"Bum-Cha-Cha, Cha Cha\" or even \"Boom-Pop-Pop, Pop,Pop\" is a representation of the beat that comes along in most funk songs with the origin of this beat derived from Central and West African music.\n<ref name=\"pitchforkmedia.com\"/><ref name=\"riofunk.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908162256/http://www.riofunk.org/ |archive-date=2006-09-08 |url-status=dead |title=RIOFUNK.org - INFORMATION ABOUT BAILE FUNK !!! |accessdate=2014-06-12 }}</ref>\n\nFunk Carioca is different from the funk originated in the United States. Starting in 1970, styles like ''bailes da pesada,'' ''black soul'', ''shaft'', and ''funk'' started to emerge in Rio de Janeiro. As time went on, DJ's started to look for other rhythms of black music, but the original name did not remain.  The term ''baile funk'' is used to refer to the parties in which Funk Carioca is played. Funk Carioca first emerged and is played throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro, but not only in the city of Rio, like Rio natives like to believe. Funk Carioca is mostly appealing to the youth. In the decade of 1980, anthropologist Herman Vianna was the first social scientist to take Funk as an object to study in his Masters thesis, which gave origin to the book  ''O Mundo Funk Carioca'', which translates to ''The Carioca Funk World''(1988). During that decade, funk dances lost a bit of popularity due to the emergence of [[disco music]], a [[pop music|pop]] version of [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]], especially after the release of the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) starring [[John Travolta]] and with soundtrack of the band [[Bee Gees]]. At the time, the then teenager, Fernando Lu\u00eds Mattos da Matta was interested in the discotheque when listening to the program Cidade Disco Club on Radio City of Rio de Janeiro (102.9 FM). Years later Fernando would adopt the nickname of [[DJ Marlboro]] and the radio would be known as the Rio \"[[rock music|rock]] radio\u201d.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nThere are a number of variants derived from funk carioca.\n\n=== Funk melody ===\n{{Main|Funk melody}}\nFunk Melody is based on Electro rhythms but with a romantic lyrical approach<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Medeiros | first1 = Jana\u00edna | title = Funk carioca: crime ou cultura? | publisher = Terceiro Nome | isbn = 9788587556745 | page = 19}} </ref>.

Many funk carioca artists started to do shows abroad at that time. [[DJ Marlboro]] and [[Favela Chic Paris]] club were the pioneer travelers and producers. The funk carioca production was until then limited to playing in the [[ghetto]]s and the Brazilian pop market. DJ Marlboro,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.uol.com.br/bigmix/djmarlboro.html | title = \u00c9 BIG MIX O MAN\u00c9}}</ref> a major composer of funk carioca's tunes declared in 2006 in the Brazilian [[Istok (magazine)|Isto \u00c9 magazine]] how astonished he was with the sudden overseas interest in the genre. He would go on to travel in over 10 European countries.\n\nIn [[London]], duo [[Tetine]] assembled a compilation album called [[Slum Dunk Presents Funk Carioca]]'','' which was released by [[Mr Bongo Records]] in 2004. Tetine also ran the weekly radio show [[Slum Dunk]] on London's radio art station [[Resonance FM|Resonance Fm 104.4]]. Their radio show was entirely dedicated to funk carioca and worked as a platform for the duo to produce and organize a series of film programs as well as interviews and gigs involving funk carioca artists from Rio.

Apart from this, Tetine also produced two albums with experimental DIY [[queer]] funk carioca: ''[[Bonde do Tet\u00e3o]]'', released by Brazilian label [[Bizarre Records]] in 2004, and ''[[L.I.C.K My Favela]]'', released by [[Kute Bash Records]] in 2005. Tetine also recorded with [[Deize Tigrona]] on the track \"I Go to the Doctor\", included in the LP ''L.I.C.K My Favela'' in 2005 and later on their album ''[[Let Your X's Be Y's]]'', released by [[Soul Jazz Records]] in 2008.\n\nIn Italy, [[Irma Records]] released the 2005 compilation [[Colors Music#4: Rio Funk|Colors Music #4: Rio Funk]]. Many small labels (notably European label [[Arcade Mode]] and [[United States|American]] labels [[Flamin\u00b4Hotz]] and Nossa) labels released several compilations and EPs in bootleg formats.\n\nThe artist [[M.I.A.

These generally focused on the social issues in the favelas. One of the most famous of these series of documentaries is [[Mr Catra the faithful]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rosforth.com/ |title=Andreas Rosforth Johnsen - Official website |publisher=Rosforth.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103034018/http://rosforth.com/ |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (2005) by [[Denmark|Danish]] filmmaker [[Andreas Rosforth Johnsen]], broadcast by many European open and cable television channels.\n\nLondon-based artist [[Sandra D'Angelo]] was the first Italian singer-producer to bring funk carioca to Italy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} She performed in London with [[Mc Gringo]] at [[Notting Hill Arts Club]] in 2008. She performed her baile funk productions for the contest ''Edison Change the Music'' in 2008. Sandra D'Angelo performed Baile Funk also in New York and produced tracks with [[EDU KA]] ([[Man Recordings]]) and DJ [[Amazing Clay]] from Rio.\n\nIn 2008, Berlin label Man Recordings released ''Gring\u00e3o'', the debut album by German [[MC Gringo]] \u2014 the only non-Brazilian MC performing in the bailes of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nEnglish indie pop band [[Everything Everything]] claim the drum patterns used on their Top 40 single [[Cough Cough]] were inspired by those used on [[Major Lazer]]'s [[Pon de Floor]], a funk carioca song.\n\n==Criticism==\nIn Brazil, funk carioca lyrics are often criticized due to their violent and sexually explicit lyrics, as well as [[misogynist]]ic content. The [[Sexism|degradation of women]] as objects for sex is a recurring theme in funk carioca. Girls are called \"cachorras\" (whores) and \"popozudas\" - large buttocks, and many songs revolve around casual and degrading sex practices with them. \"Novinhas\" (young/underaged girls) as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] are also a frequent theme in funk carioca songs.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW-zq-sspQo |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Some of these songs, however, are sung by women.\n\nThe extreme banalization of sex and the incitement of [[promiscuity]] is viewed as a negative aspect of the funk carioca culture. Besides the moral considerations, in favelas, where sanitary conditions are poor and [[sex education]] low, this might lead to [[public health]] and social issues. In such communities, definitive [[Birth control|contraceptive methods]] are hardly available and due to lack of education and awareness, [[family planning]] is close to nonexistent. This environment results in unwanted pregnancies, population overgrowth, and eventually the growth of the communities ([[faveliza\u00e7\u00e3o]]).<ref name=\"www1.folha.uol.com.br\">{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u128489.shtml |title=Folha Online - Cotidiano - Atlas aponta natalidade maior que a m\u00e9dia em favelas da Grande SP - 22/11/2006 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref><ref name=\"rjtv.globo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://rjtv.globo.com/Jornalismo/RJTV/0,,MUL131124-9097,00.html |title=G1 \u2013 Rio de Janeiro: not\u00edcias e v\u00eddeos da Globo |publisher=Rjtv.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Glamour (presentation)|glamor]]ization of [[criminality]] in the favelas is also frequently viewed as another negative consequence of funk carioca. Some funk songs, belonging to a style known as \"proibid\u00e3o\" (\"the forbidden\"), have very violent lyrics and are sometimes composed by drug-dealing gangs. Its themes include praising the murders of rival gang members and cops, intimidating opposers, claiming power over the favelas, robbery, drug use and the illicit life of drug dealers in general. Authorities view some of these lyrics as \"recruiting\" people to organized crime and inciting violence, and playing some of these songs are thus considered a crime.<ref name=\"osmelhoresvideos.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osmelhoresvideos.net/video/1614/proibidoes-nos-bailes-funks-das-favelas-do-rio-de-janeiro.html |title=V\u00eddeo \u00bb Proibid\u00f5es nos bailes funks das favelas do Rio de janeiro |publisher=OsMelhoresVideos.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of regulation and the locations where they usually take place, \"[[bailes funk]]\" are also very crime prone environments.

The first version is the one broadcast by local radio stations; the second is played in dance halls, parties, and in public by sound cars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sansone, Livio. \"The Localization of Global Funk in Bahia and Rio.\" Brazilian Popular Music & Globalization, 139.

This is usually denounced in the lyrics and the hope for a better life is carried through many of their messages.<ref name=\"riofunk.org\"/>\n\nWith its recent success in Europe, it has also been criticized that Brazil is exporting music that is much inferior when compared to the [[bossa nova]] of the 1950s/60s and the [[Brazilian rock]] that had been made famous in the 1980s. It has been rumored that most of the funk projects in favelas are also financially backed by drug lords, so many song lyrics deal with challenging the police together with a subversive nature to the law currently established in Brazil.\n\n===Response===\nDefenders of funk carioca argue that the genre is an authentic expression of the culture of [[Afro-Brazilian]] communities, and the lyrics of a sexual nature reflect the sexual freedom found in Brazilian society.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Surra de Bunda]]\n* [[Miami bass]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,13887,1569728,00.html \"Ghetto Fabulous\" Observer Music Monthly article on Baile Funk by Alex Bellos 2005]\n* [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1166677,00.html \"Samba, That's So Last Year\" article by Alex Bellos at The Guardian 2004]\n* [http://www.thefreeradical.ca/in_the_fight_clubs_of_rio_monday.htm \"In The Fight Club Of Rio\" article on \"corridor balls\" at Free Radical by Canadian Nicole Veash 2000]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080602043605/http://musibrasil.net/articolo.php?id=1915 Article with Baile Funk master Sany Pitbull by Sabrina Fidalgo at Musibrasil 2007]\n* [https://xlr8r.com/features/the-funk-phenomenon/ \"The Funk Phenomenon\" article by Bruno Natal at XLR8R magazine 2005]\n* [http://www.proibidao.org/funk-carioca-and-musica-soul/ ''Funk Carioca'' and ''M\u00fasica Soul'' by Carlos Palombini]\n{{Hip Hop}}\n{{Lusophonemusic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Funk Carioca}}\n[[Category:Brazilian styles of music]]\n[[Category:Funk carioca| ]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:sampler\u2192sampler (musical instrument),Trap\u2192Trap music,electronic\u2192electronic music", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_carioca"}

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |APOE gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in AD.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/>   [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.<ref name=LBDACareMeds>{{cite web |url=

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.<ref name=Boot2013/><ref name=LBDAEarlyCare>{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |APOE gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in AD.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/>   [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most common form of neurodegnerative dementia after AD as of 2020.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Walker2015/> DLB itself is one of the three most common types of dementia,

As of 2018, its population was 246,452.<ref name=\"IBGE2\" /> The city covers an area of {{cvt|217|km2}}, and the average temperature is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}, which is mild for the region. The [[Sinos River]] runs through the urban area.\n\nConsolidated by German immigrants, the city was named after [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].  Novo Hamburgo's population is still predominantly of German descent.\n\nIn the 1980s, Novo Hamburgo received the nickname of \"the national capital of shoes\", attracting many athletes, tracks and companies connected to the sport. Nowadays, the city is the industrial centre of the [[Sinos River Valley]], the economy of which is based mainly on the manufacture of shoes and the associated leather goods supply chain.\n\n==History==\n\nThe area of the city was first settled by Portuguese immigrants in the mid 18th century, but it would grow to the status of village only with the arrival of the first German immigrants in 1824. At that time, Novo Hamburgo was part of  [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], the cradle of [[German Brazilian|German immigration]] in [[Brazil]]. The Germans established a prosperous agricultural colony and eventually started to supply the state's main urban centers at that time with food.\n\nSome of the immigrants also brought handicraft skills, valuable for a self-sufficient, isolated economy, as the valley and the state were at that time. In Novo Hamburgo, the first urban agglomeration appeared around the Hamburger Berg, circa 1870, where there was a little commerce. The city was emancipated from [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] on 5 April 1927, and soon joined the rest of Brazil in its run to [[industrialization]].  The city was made the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Hamburgo]] in 1980.\n\n==Emancipation==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/emancipacao/</ref>\nIn the mid 1920s, Novo Hamburgo was a sub district of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]]. At this time, the shoe industry was in full swing and there was an intense expansion of trade and an abundance of work for the service providers in the region. In 1924 this expansion prompted a group of men to create a committee with the goal of achieving emancipation for the district. These men were: [[Jacob Kroeff Neto]], [[Pedro Adams Filho]], [[Leopodo Petry]], Andr\u00e9 Klipp, Julius Kunz, Jos\u00e9 Jo\u00e3o Carlos Martins and Carlos Dienstbach.\n\nOn three occasions letters sent to the [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] council requesting emancipation were denied. Faced with this rejection the group decided to send the request to the state government. The governor at that time was [[Borges de Medeiros]] who subsequently asked the commission to submit a formal application including voter signatures requesting emancipation.\n\nThree years later on the 5 April 1927, [[Borges de Medeiros]] signed decree number 3818, known as \u201cThe order Gold\u201d creating the municipality Novo Hamburgo. On the same day decree number 3819 was signed creating an administration with a constitutional basis and allowing for the nomination of a temporary mayor. The document gave a maximum period of two months to hold an election for mayor and councillors.\n[[Jacob Kroeff Netto]] was named the first Provisional Mayor of Novo Hamburgo by Borges, under decree number 3820.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Hydrography===\n\nNovo Hamburgo is part of the [[River Sinos basin]]. The city is divided into four basins, formed by Pampa creek, Cerquinho creek, Luiz Rau creek and Gauchinha creek. As well as these, there are several creeks that flow into the v\u00e1rzea region of the Sinos, both on the north bank of the river and in the south.\n\n===Climate===\n\nNovo Hamburgo has four well defined seasons. In winter, temperatures can hover around {{cvt|0|\u00b0C}}, and in some instances can reach {{cvt|-2|to(-)|-1|\u00b0C}}. In the summer the temperatures get high, often above {{cvt|30|\u00b0C}}. The average temperature of Novo Hamburgo during the year is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Novo Hamburgo\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|width = 100%\n|collapsed =\n|Jan high C =\t29.3\n|Feb high C =\t28.4\n|Mar high C =\t26.3\n|Apr high C =\t23.4\n|May high C =\t20.4\n|Jun high C =\t19.3\n|Jul high C =\t19.5\n|Aug high C =\t20.8\n|Sep high C =\t22.7\n|Oct high C =\t25\n|Nov high C =\t27.4\n|Dec high C =\t26.6\n|year high C =\t24.1\n|Jan mean C =\t24.5\n|Feb mean C =\t23.9\n|Mar mean C =\t21.8\n|Apr mean C =\t18.9\n|May mean C =\t16\n|Jun mean C =\t14.8\n|Jul mean C =\t14.9\n|Aug mean C =\t16.1\n|Sep mean C =\t17.9\n|Oct mean C =\t20\n|Nov mean C =\t22.2\n|Dec mean C =\t21.8\n|year mean C =\t19.4\n|Jan low C =\t19.8\n|Feb low C =\t19.4\n|Mar low C =\t17.4\n|Apr low C =\t14.4\n|May low C =\t11.7\n|Jun low C =\t10.4\n|Jul low C =\t10.4\n|Aug low C =\t11.5\n|Sep low C =\t13.1\n|Oct low C =\t15.1\n|Nov low C =\t17\n|Dec low C =\t17.1\n|year low C =\t14.8\n|precipitation colour =\tgreen\n|Jan precipitation mm =\t126\n|Feb precipitation mm =\t124\n|Mar precipitation mm =\t128\n|Apr precipitation mm =\t110\n|May precipitation mm =\t107\n|Jun precipitation mm =\t131\n|Jul precipitation mm =\t123\n|Aug precipitation mm =\t126\n|Sep precipitation mm =\t143\n|Oct precipitation mm =\t124\n|Nov precipitation mm =\t106\n|Dec precipitation mm =\t119\n|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Industry==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is most famous for its footwear industry.<ref name=\"novohamburgo.org\">http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/industria-comercio-e-servicos/</ref> The footwear manufacturing industry came about quite quickly, and led to Novo Hamburgo being recognized as the Capital of Brazilian Footwear. The city also has industries in the area of pharmacy, cosmetics, furniture, food, appliances, clothing, graphic art, electronics, chemical and constructions.\n\nThis industry also spread into neighboring towns, with many tanneries, chemical plants and shoe component factories being opened.\nOne example of this industry is the National Fair of Shoes held annually in Fenac. This fair was started locally in 1963 held in a small neighbourhood convention centre. Today, [[Fenac]] is not only home to this fair but also other related fairs such as Fimec (footwear machines exhibition), and Courovis\u00e3o Ecovis\u00e3o (Leather Fair).\n\nA new Industrial District is being planned in the area of [[Lomba Grande]], however some locals have voiced concerns that this construction may have environmental implications.\n\n===Export===\nIt is estimated that about 80% of Brazilian exports of shoes come out of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], with Novo Hamburgo being the center of these operations.<ref name=\"novohamburgo.org\"/> Novo Hamburgo has developed a complete infrastructure for production, marketing and trading of footwear, and now has the largest movement of containers in [[Brazil]]. The export of shoes is currently worth about two billion dollars.\n\n==Shops and services==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is the largest commercial area of [[Sinos River Valley]], with more than 5,500 outlets, including major Brazilian chain stores such as Magazine Luiza, [[Lojas Renner]], [[C&A]], [[Lojas Americanas]], [[Casas Bahia]], [[Ponto Frio]], [[Lojas Colombo]] and Delta Sul.\n\nIn the shopping district there are four large supermarkets([[Wal-Mart, recently sold by the parent multinational and now under different ownership]]), [[Carrefour]], Bourbon ([[Zaffari]]) and Hiper Rissul. There are two malls in this city: Bourbon Shopping Novo Hamburgo and i-Fashion Outlet.\n\nExample of the service industry are cargo agents, brokers, export agents, trading companies as well as the presence of important banks.\n\n==Theatre==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/lazer/teatro/</ref> \n[[File:Teatro Feevale.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre Feevale.]]\nThe Paschoal Charlemagne Theatre located at the Culture Department of Novo Hamburgo, has a capacity for approximately 490 people. Paran\u00f3ia Productions has a school in the theatre trains local actors. The school has sent students to the biggest cities of the country to work inplays and shows.\n\n<ref>http://www.feevale.br/internas/vwImprensaVisualizar.asp?intIdSecao=2575&intIdConteudo=48472&dteDataPublicacao=2011/09/23/</ref> The [[Feevale University]] inaugurated on 20 September 2011 the largest theatre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul with a capacity to 1.805 spectators in Novo Hamburgo. The theatre was built in the campus II of the university. It is administered in partnership with Opus Promotions.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Evangelic School Hamburgo Velho.jpg|thumb|right|The first students of the Evangelical Foundation Teachers and Founders.]]\n\nThe first school in Novo Hamburgo was founded in 1832, called Comunidade Evang\u00e9lica Hamburgo Velho (Old Hamburg Evangelic Community).<ref>http://www.historiaehistoria.com.br/materia.cfm?tb=artigos&id=151</ref> The school taught through the [[German language]] as that was the most common language at that time. The teaching material was poor and the provincial government was giving them little support. The central government at the time had no interest in investing in education and therefore would not release funds to the different provinces.\n\nIn 1833 there were only two public schools, in 1866 a school for girls was founded by a group of Nuns - The Engel Sisters located in the [[Hamburgo Velho]] neighborhood. which would become a \"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Evang\u00e9lica\" (Evangelic Foundation). The creation of this school was a big step for women's education, although still largely focused on traditional values such as child rearing and home care.\n\nThe first Catholic school created in the town was Santa Catarina college founded on the 10 June 1900<ref>http://pt.scribd.com/doc/33658980/Livro-Colegio-Santa-Catarina-100-Anos-de-Historia</ref> by the Sisters Maria Romualda Flash and Maria Julitta Schwark, who were invited to come to the Hamburg Berg region (which would later become Hamburgo Velho) by several families - Czermak, Carlos Klein, Jos\u00e9 Kroeff, Jo\u00e3o Altmeyer, Zimmer and Plentz.\n\nThe Jesuit [[priests]] arrived in the [[Sinos River Valley]] region in the mid-nineteenth century and took over the Church Nossa Senhora da Piedade in [[Hamburgo Velho]]. In 1914, the Priest Benedict Meienhofer organized the opening of a Catholic school for boys, which was called St. Jacob's college.\n[[File:Campus II.jpg|thumb|right|Feevale University.]]\nIn 1927, the year when Novo Hamburgo was emancipated, there were seven state schools in the city, with a total of 374 students, one state school with 72 students and six private schools with 478 students. In 1930 there were eight state schools, six city run schools and eight private schools, with the student population rising to 1,477.\n\nThe [[Vargas Era]] (1930\u20131945) represented a significant advance in Brazilian education. This educational revolution also had an impact in Novo Hamburgo. In 1943, the city schools had grown to a total of 35, with a total of 3668 students.\n \nThe main educational institutions in Novo Hamburgo today are:\n\n* Ceducs Centro de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Superior\n* Col\u00e9gio Marista Pio XII\n* Col\u00e9gio Santa Catarina\n* Faculdade IENH \u2014 Institui\u00e7\u00e3o Evang\u00e9lica do Novo Hamburgo\n* Ftec Faculdades\n* Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Escola T\u00e9cnica Liberato Salzano V da Cunha\n* Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul\n* [[Universidade Feevale]]\n\n==Tourism==\n\n[[File:Schmitt-Presser.JPG|thumb|right|[[Schmitt-Presser]] Museum.]]\n[[File:Foundation Scheffel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Foundation Scheffel]].]]\nNovo Hamburgo is one of 13 charming cities on the [[Rota Rom\u00e2ntica]], a scenic bypass of Brazilian cities in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] with heavy Germanic influence.  Other cities on the [[Rota Rom\u00e2ntica]] are [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], [[Est\u00e2ncia Velha]], [[Ivoti]], [[Dois Irm\u00e3os]], [[Morro Reuter]], [[Santa Maria do Herval]], [[Presidente Lucena]], [[Picada Caf\u00e9]], [[Nova Petr\u00f3polis]], [[Gramado]], [[Canela, Rio Grande do Sul|Canela]] and [[S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul|S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula]].\n\nIn the historical centre which is located in the Hamburgo Velho neighbourhood, there are still some half-timbered buildings constructed in the same technique, as the Community [[Schmitt-Presser Museum]] (first exemplary technique protected by IPHAN in Brazil).\nThere are also the works of the German architect Ernst Seubert, some of his known buildings are the [[Church of Reis Magos]] (IECLB), the [[Church of Our Lady of Mercy]], [[Bakery Reiss]] (\"Padaria Reiss\"), [[Schmitt House]] (\"Casa Rosa\") and [[Municipal Public Library Machado De Assis]]. Also noteworthy is the neoclassical building of the [[Ernesto Frederico Scheffel Foundation]].\n\nThere is a \"historic-cultural street\" called Rua General Os\u00f3rio, along which there are dozens of historic buildings from various periods. Notable buildings along this street are the [[St. Catherine College]], the building of the former [[Frohsin Society]], designed by the German architect Theo Wiederspahn, the homes of the families Richter, Klein, Momberger, Snel, and Grunner, This street is recognized by the City Master Plan as an area of historical and cultural interest.\n\nThe downtown area has landmarks such as the [[Monument to the Shoemaker]], [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis Gonzaga]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Ascension]], both historical constructions of the 1950s. The latter follows the Gothic style, with pure forms of the original Gothic architecture. There are also dozens of eclectic houses distributed among this historical area, but these are not officially recognized. The city also presents some interesting examples of modernism, especially residences built in the period 1950\u20131960.\n\n===Natural Attractions Lomba Grande===\n<ref>[[:pt:Lomba Grande]]</ref>\nIt is the Rural District of Novo Hamburgo, occupied an area of 156 square kilometers, making a total of two thirds of the municipal area. It is considered environmentally protected area where the wetlands of the [[Sinos River]] is very important for the preservation of the ecosystem, both [[fauna]] as [[flora]].\n\n[[Lomba Grande]] also received the first [[Germans|German]] [[immigrants]] who settled in the Hemp Linen factory, then owned by the municipality of [[Sao Leopoldo]]. Today provides one of the main points of visiting the city, where the natural attractions of the neighborhood next to developments designed for leisure and tourism attracts many tourists.\n<ref>http://lombagrande.blogspot.com/</ref>\nThey are [[horse racing]], recreational sites, [[resorts]], environmental education center, allowing tourists to enjoy outdoor activities such as horseback riding, [[adventure tourism]], contact with [[animals]], recreation, [[swimming pools]], [[mountain biking]], among a host of other activities.\n\n<ref>http://www.lombagrande.org.br/index.htm</ref>\nAlso in Lomba Grande that are harvested without pesticides the [[horticultural]] trade shows that cater to the rural producer in some properties of family farms and cooperatives produce colonial products and integrals.\nThere are restaurants offering food fresh from the colonial neighborhood itself. The neighborhood also has many cultural attractions such as [[church (building)|churches]], [[cemeteries]] and a roadmap that includes visits to artists.\n\n==Economy and society==\n\nThe [[Germans|German]] craftsmen eventually started to manufacture shoes and machinery on a large scale and in the 1960s began to export goods, a process that transformed the city into a magnet for internal immigrants from impoverished areas around the state and the country. This caused significant demographic growth that was not accompanied by the infrastructure needed to accommodate the recently arrived population; [[favelas]] then formed, which are the source of many of today's social problems.\nToday's Novo Hamburgo depends heavily upon shoe exports, although it diversified its industrial and commercial base in the early 1990s.\n\n==Newspapers==\n<ref>https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:h2b2d1ZZERgJ:paginas.ufrgs.br/alcar/encontros-nacionais-1/2o-encontro-2004-1/A%2520HISTORIA%2520DO%2520JORNALISMO%2520EM%2520NOVO%2520HAMBURGO.doc+jornal+monoclo+novo+hamburgo&hl=en&gl=ie&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg7VbgAlmKl69YlkA6WJ204m2o4hL9Dw6bKd0txK1619LF8sFwN90VavRSxwN7379hg3bFvdibkShHMy3wXw4aNT60jwieXa1o4Ccx1WlxXkyHGzWdl1cmJe24EIKVu5G2etLCK&sig=AHIEtbQ9D-3CjLWfCtWu_4K4wqb_4bL28A</ref>\nIn 1918 the first newspaper called the Monoclo was registered and circulated, the paper was directed by Arnaldo Mayer and distributed on Saturdays. This newspaper had a short life, lasting only nine issues, this was during the period in which [[Hamburguer Berg]] was still a district of [[Sao Leopoldo]]. There are reports that the Monoclo had an important role in the fight for emancipation of Novo Hamburgo city, despite having closed its activities before Novo Hamburgo was emancipated.\n\nThe ''5 Abril'' newspaper is considered the first newspaper published in the city of Novo Hamburgo, this was set up by [[Leopoldo Petry]] who decided to create the newspaper to defend the interests of the city. The ''5 Abril'' newspapers were published weekly in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], but with [[Advertising|ads]] in [[German language|German]]. The newspaper lasted 35 years, completing 1811 editions. There were four pages per issue and 200 to 300 copies were distributed each week. These were significant numbers for the period, given that the [[German language]] was predominant among the 8,500 inhabitants.<ref name=\"unirevista.unisinos.br\">http://www.unirevista.unisinos.br/_pdf/UNIrev_Machado.PDF</ref> Over the next 30 to 50 years, there were several newspapers that began publishing in Novo Hamburgo such as:\n\n* The Novo Hamburgo newspaper directed by Anthony Benfica Filho,\n* The Intriga newspaper (1931).\n* Pau na Nunca newspaper (1931);\n* Gazeta Novo Hamburgo, led by Octavian Barreto de Borba (1934);\n* Gazeta newspaper (1948);\n* Evolucao newspaper (1953);\n* Correio Gaucho (1955);\n* Jornal NH (1960).\n\nThe development of \u201c[[ga\u00facho]]\u201d journalism generated opportunities for the creation of new newspapers in such as the Jornal SL in 1957 in [[Sao Leopoldo]] and [[Jornal NH]], in 1960 in Novo Hamburgo. Today, with more than 250,000 inhabitants, Novo Hamburgo is the seventh most populated city in the state. Jornal NH is the largest newspaper in the region, one of the largest published in the state and the largest newspaper in Brazil outside a major metropolitan area, by number of subscribers. Jornal NH is part of Grupo Sinos, a conglomerate of regional newspapers, magazines, radio and digital content.\n\n===Radio===\n<ref name=\"unirevista.unisinos.br\"/>\nThe first broadcast in Novo Hamburgo was Radio Hamburguense Progresso in 1948, directed by Milton Vergara Corr\u00eaa. The city currently has 6 radio stations, and 5 broadcasting on FM, and one on AM. They are: ABC Radio 900 AM,1 05.3 Union, Alegria 92.9, 88.7 FM, 99.9 and Novo Tempo 90.3 FM Oi.\n\n===Television===\n\n<ref>http://www.feevale.br/internas/default.asp?intIdSecao=269&intIdConteudo=1379</ref>\nTV Feevale is a university channel that broadcasts on channel 15 at NET broadband in Novo Hamburgo.

It is affectionately known as Anilado among fans. The club dispute some championships. The club was founded on 1 May 1911 by a group of employees of the extinct Adams shoe factory.\nSince then, the Hamburguenses could watch in the victories of team the Santa Rosa Stadium.\nThe stadium was sold in 2005, and a new stadium was built in 2011, called [[Est\u00e1dio do Vale]].\n\nTennis is another sport very important in Novo Hamburgo. The city featured athletes like [[Fernando Roese]], [[Paulo Taicher]], [[Tom\u00e1s Behrend]], [[Andr\u00e9 Heller]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Ghem]].\n\nThere are some places that offer tennis courts and host sport competitions such as Sociedade Gin\u00e1stica, Alian\u00e7a and Wallau Centro de Esportes.\n\nIn the city, it is also possible to practice or attend games and competitions in tennis, volleyball, punhobol, futsal, archery, handball, bicycle motocross, among other activities.\n\n==Metro==\n\n<ref>http://www.estacoesferroviarias.com.br/rs_linhaspoa/novohamb.htm</ref>\nThe history of the railways of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] date back to 1866 with proposals for construction in the [[Sinos River Valley]] region. On 14 April 1874, the first train track between [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Sao Leopoldo]] was completed. This was constructed by a British Company called ''[[The Porto Alegre & New Hamburg Brazilian Railway Company Limited]]''. Owned by Johan Mac Ginity.\n\nThe first train arrived in Novo Hamburgo on 1 January 1876. The station was named Novo Hamburgo Station. The railway did not go through the village of [[Hamburguer Berg]], the station was built some 3&nbsp;km away thus, a new urban area began to develop around the railway station. Only in 1882 the Novo Hamburgo station was connected at the village which was named as Hamburguer Berg, this line eventually was extended to [[Canela, Rio Grande do Sul|Canela]] in 1922.\n\nIn 1919, the Novo Hamburgo station was renamed Borges de Medeiros, reflecting the anti-German sentiment caused by Great War and also Hamburg Berg was renamed Genuine Sampaio. However, Novo Hamburgo station returned to the original name in 1920 and Hamburguer Berg received its current name of [[Hamburgo Velho]].\n\nIn 1964, the Novo Hamburgo to [[Taquara]] line was closed, leaving Novo Hamburgo station as the end point of the line. In late 1966, the rest of section, Rio dos Sinos to Novo Hamburgo stations was abolished and the station was deactivated.\n\nIn 2008 the Federal government authorized the expansion of [[Porto Alegre Metro]] train services to Novo Hamburgo. The works started in early 2009 and is expected to be completed 2013. This project includes the construction of an additional 9.3 kilometres and four new stations: Rio dos Sinos, in the municipality of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], Liberdade, Fenac and Novo Hamburgo, in the city of Novo Hamburgo.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Maicon (footballer born 1981)|Maicon]] (born 1981), football player\n* [[Muriel Gustavo Becker]] (born 1987), football player\n* [[Alisson (footballer, born 1992)|Alisson]], football player\n* [[Matheus Leist]], racing driver\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Novo Hamburgo}}\n* [http://www.novohamburgo.rs.gov.br Novo Hamburgo Local Government]\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=novo+hamburgo,+brazil&ie=UTF8&z=13&om=1 Novo Hamburgo detailed city Street Map]\n\n{{Municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul}}\n{{Rota Rom\u00e2ntica}}\n\n[[Category:Novo Hamburgo]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1832]]\n[[Category:German-Brazilian culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name            = City of Novo Hamburgo\n| nickname                 = National Capital of Shoes\n| motto                    =\n| website                  = [http://www.novohamburgo.rs.gov.br novohamburgo.rs.gov.br]\n| image_skyline            = Viewnovohamburgo.JPG\n| image_caption            = \n| image_flag               = Bandeira de Novo Hamburgo.svg\n| image_seal               = Bras\u00e3o de Novo Hamburgo.svg\n| image_map                = Locator map of Novo Hamburgo in Rio Grande do Sul.svg\n| map_caption              = Location in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]]\n| subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_type1        = [[Regions of Brazil|Region]]\n| subdivision_type2        = [[States of Brazil|State]]\n| subdivision_name         = {{BRA}}\n| subdivision_name1        = [[South Region, Brazil|South]] \n| subdivision_name2        = [[Rio Grande do Sul]]\n| leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n| leader_name              = F\u00e1tima Daudt ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]])\n| established_title        = Founded\n| established_date         = 1832\n| established_title2       = Incorporated\n| established_date2        = 1927\n| area_footnotes           =\n| area_total_km2           = 224\n| population_footnotes     =\n| population_as_of         = 2018 est.<ref name=\"IBGE2\">{{cite web |title=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|url=ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Estimativas_de_Populacao/Estimativas_2018/estimativa_dou_2018_20181019.pdf |year=2018 |quote=2018 Estimates of Population |accessdate=6 March 2019 |lang=pt-BR |format=PDF}}</ref>\n| population_total         = 246452\n| population_density_km2   = auto\n| timezone                 = [[UTC|UTC\u22123]]\n| utc_offset               = -3\n| timezone_DST             = [[UTC|UTC\u22122]]\n| utc_offset_DST           = -2\n| coordinates              = {{coord|29|40|40|S|51|07|51|W|region:BR|display=inline,title}}\n| elevation_footnotes      =\n| elevation_m              = 57\n| footnotes                =\n}}\n'''Novo Hamburgo''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''New [[Hamburg]]''; {{lang-de|Neu-Hamburg}}) is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the southernmost [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], located in the [[metropolitan area]] of [[Porto Alegre]], the state capital. As of 2018, its population was 246,452.<ref name=\"IBGE2\"></ref> The city covers an area of {{cvt|217|km2}}, and the average temperature is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}, which is mild for the region. The [[Sinos River]] runs through the urban area.\n\nConsolidated by German immigrants, the city was named after [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].  Novo Hamburgo's population is still predominantly of German descent.\n\nIn the 1980s, Novo Hamburgo received the nickname of \"the national capital of shoes\", attracting many athletes, tracks and companies connected to the sport. Nowadays, the city is the industrial centre of the [[Sinos River Valley]], the economy of which is based mainly on the manufacture of shoes and the associated leather goods supply chain.\n\n==History==\n\nThe area of the city was first settled by Portuguese immigrants in the mid 18th century, but it would grow to the status of village only with the arrival of the first German immigrants in 1824. At that time, Novo Hamburgo was part of  [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], the cradle of [[German Brazilian|German immigration]] in [[Brazil]]. The Germans established a prosperous agricultural colony and eventually started to supply the state's main urban centers at that time with food.\n\nSome of the immigrants also brought handicraft skills, valuable for a self-sufficient, isolated economy, as the valley and the state were at that time. In Novo Hamburgo, the first urban agglomeration appeared around the Hamburger Berg, circa 1870, where there was a little commerce. The city was emancipated from [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] on 5 April 1927, and soon joined the rest of Brazil in its run to [[industrialization]].  The city was made the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Hamburgo]] in 1980.\n\n==Emancipation==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/emancipacao/</ref>\nIn the mid 1920s, Novo Hamburgo was a sub district of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]]. At this time, the shoe industry was in full swing and there was an intense expansion of trade and an abundance of work for the service providers in the region. In 1924 this expansion prompted a group of men to create a committee with the goal of achieving emancipation for the district. These men were: [[Jacob Kroeff Neto]], [[Pedro Adams Filho]], [[Leopodo Petry]], Andr\u00e9 Klipp, Julius Kunz, Jos\u00e9 Jo\u00e3o Carlos Martins and Carlos Dienstbach.\n\nOn three occasions letters sent to the [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]] council requesting emancipation were denied. Faced with this rejection the group decided to send the request to the state government. The governor at that time was [[Borges de Medeiros]] who subsequently asked the commission to submit a formal application including voter signatures requesting emancipation.\n\nThree years later on the 5 April 1927, [[Borges de Medeiros]] signed decree number 3818, known as \u201cThe order Gold\u201d creating the municipality Novo Hamburgo. On the same day decree number 3819 was signed creating an administration with a constitutional basis and allowing for the nomination of a temporary mayor. The document gave a maximum period of two months to hold an election for mayor and councillors.\n[[Jacob Kroeff Netto]] was named the first Provisional Mayor of Novo Hamburgo by Borges, under decree number 3820.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Hydrography===\n\nNovo Hamburgo is part of the [[River Sinos basin]]. The city is divided into four basins, formed by Pampa creek, Cerquinho creek, Luiz Rau creek and Gauchinha creek. As well as these, there are several creeks that flow into the v\u00e1rzea region of the Sinos, both on the north bank of the river and in the south.\n\n===Climate===\n\nNovo Hamburgo has four well defined seasons. In winter, temperatures can hover around {{cvt|0|\u00b0C}}, and in some instances can reach {{cvt|-2|to(-)|-1|\u00b0C}}. In the summer the temperatures get high, often above {{cvt|30|\u00b0C}}. The average temperature of Novo Hamburgo during the year is {{cvt|19|\u00b0C}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Novo Hamburgo\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|width = 100%\n|collapsed =\n|Jan high C =\t29.3\n|Feb high C =\t28.4\n|Mar high C =\t26.3\n|Apr high C =\t23.4\n|May high C =\t20.4\n|Jun high C =\t19.3\n|Jul high C =\t19.5\n|Aug high C =\t20.8\n|Sep high C =\t22.7\n|Oct high C =\t25\n|Nov high C =\t27.4\n|Dec high C =\t26.6\n|year high C =\t24.1\n|Jan mean C =\t24.5\n|Feb mean C =\t23.9\n|Mar mean C =\t21.8\n|Apr mean C =\t18.9\n|May mean C =\t16\n|Jun mean C =\t14.8\n|Jul mean C =\t14.9\n|Aug mean C =\t16.1\n|Sep mean C =\t17.9\n|Oct mean C =\t20\n|Nov mean C =\t22.2\n|Dec mean C =\t21.8\n|year mean C =\t19.4\n|Jan low C =\t19.8\n|Feb low C =\t19.4\n|Mar low C =\t17.4\n|Apr low C =\t14.4\n|May low C =\t11.7\n|Jun low C =\t10.4\n|Jul low C =\t10.4\n|Aug low C =\t11.5\n|Sep low C =\t13.1\n|Oct low C =\t15.1\n|Nov low C =\t17\n|Dec low C =\t17.1\n|year low C =\t14.8\n|precipitation colour =\tgreen\n|Jan precipitation mm =\t126\n|Feb precipitation mm =\t124\n|Mar precipitation mm =\t128\n|Apr precipitation mm =\t110\n|May precipitation mm =\t107\n|Jun precipitation mm =\t131\n|Jul precipitation mm =\t123\n|Aug precipitation mm =\t126\n|Sep precipitation mm =\t143\n|Oct precipitation mm =\t124\n|Nov precipitation mm =\t106\n|Dec precipitation mm =\t119\n|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Industry==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is most famous for its footwear industry.<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/industria-comercio-e-servicos/</ref> The footwear manufacturing industry came about quite quickly, and led to Novo Hamburgo being recognized as the Capital of Brazilian Footwear. The city also has industries in the area of pharmacy, cosmetics, furniture, food, appliances, clothing, graphic art, electronics, chemical and constructions.\n\nThis industry also spread into neighboring towns, with many tanneries, chemical plants and shoe component factories being opened.\nOne example of this industry is the National Fair of Shoes held annually in Fenac. This fair was started locally in 1963 held in a small neighbourhood convention centre. Today, [[Fenac]] is not only home to this fair but also other related fairs such as Fimec (footwear machines exhibition), and Courovis\u00e3o Ecovis\u00e3o (Leather Fair).\n\nA new Industrial District is being planned in the area of [[Lomba Grande]], however some locals have voiced concerns that this construction may have environmental implications.\n\n===Export===\nIt is estimated that about 80% of Brazilian exports of shoes come out of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], with Novo Hamburgo being the center of these operations.<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/historia/industria-comercio-e-servicos/</ref> Novo Hamburgo has developed a complete infrastructure for production, marketing and trading of footwear, and now has the largest movement of containers in [[Brazil]]. The export of shoes is currently worth about two billion dollars.\n\n==Shops and services==\n\nNovo Hamburgo is the largest commercial area of [[Sinos River Valley]], with more than 5,500 outlets, including major Brazilian chain stores such as Magazine Luiza, [[Lojas Renner]], [[C&A]], [[Lojas Americanas]], [[Casas Bahia]], [[Ponto Frio]], [[Lojas Colombo]] and Delta Sul.\n\nIn the shopping district there are four large supermarkets([[Wal-Mart, recently sold by the parent multinational and now under different ownership]]), [[Carrefour]], Bourbon ([[Zaffari]]) and Hiper Rissul. There are two malls in this city: Bourbon Shopping Novo Hamburgo and i-Fashion Outlet.\n\nExample of the service industry are cargo agents, brokers, export agents, trading companies as well as the presence of important banks.\n\n==Theatre==\n<ref>http://novohamburgo.org/site/nossa-cidade/lazer/teatro/</ref> \n[[File:Teatro Feevale.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre Feevale.]]\nThe Paschoal Charlemagne Theatre located at the Culture Department of Novo Hamburgo, has a capacity for approximately 490 people.

The teaching material was poor and the provincial government was giving them little support. The central government at the time had no interest in investing in education and therefore would not release funds to the different provinces.\n\nIn 1833 there were only two public schools, in 1866 a school for girls was founded by a group of Nuns - The Engel Sisters located in the [[Hamburgo Velho]] neighborhood. which would become a \"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Evang\u00e9lica\" (Evangelic Foundation). The creation of this school was a big step for women's education, although still largely focused on traditional values such as child rearing and home care.\n\nThe first Catholic school created in the town was Santa Catarina college founded on the 10 June 1900<ref>http://pt.scribd.com/doc/33658980/Livro-Colegio-Santa-Catarina-100-Anos-de-Historia</ref> by the Sisters Maria Romualda Flash and Maria Julitta Schwark, who were invited to come to the Hamburg Berg region (which would later become Hamburgo Velho) by several families - Czermak, Carlos Klein, Jos\u00e9 Kroeff, Jo\u00e3o Altmeyer, Zimmer and Plentz.\n\nThe Jesuit [[priests]] arrived in the [[Sinos River Valley]] region in the mid-nineteenth century and took over the Church Nossa Senhora da Piedade in [[Hamburgo Velho]]. In 1914, the Priest Benedict Meienhofer organized the opening of a Catholic school for boys, which was called St. Jacob's college.\n[[File:Campus II.jpg|thumb|right|Feevale University.]]\nIn 1927, the year when Novo Hamburgo was emancipated, there were seven state schools in the city, with a total of 374 students, one state school with 72 students and six private schools with 478 students. In 1930 there were eight state schools, six city run schools and eight private schools, with the student population rising to 1,477.\n\nThe [[Vargas Era]] (1930\u20131945) represented a significant advance in Brazilian education. This educational revolution also had an impact in Novo Hamburgo.

Also noteworthy is the neoclassical building of the [[Ernesto Frederico Scheffel Foundation]].\n\nThere is a \"historic-cultural street\" called Rua General Os\u00f3rio, along which there are dozens of historic buildings from various periods. Notable buildings along this street are the [[St. Catherine College]], the building of the former [[Frohsin Society]], designed by the German architect Theo Wiederspahn, the homes of the families Richter, Klein, Momberger, Snel, and Grunner, This street is recognized by the City Master Plan as an area of historical and cultural interest.\n\nThe downtown area has landmarks such as the [[Monument to the Shoemaker]], [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis Gonzaga]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Ascension]], both historical constructions of the 1950s. The latter follows the Gothic style, with pure forms of the original Gothic architecture. There are also dozens of eclectic houses distributed among this historical area, but these are not officially recognized. The city also presents some interesting examples of modernism, especially residences built in the period 1950\u20131960.\n\n===Natural Attractions Lomba Grande===\n<ref>[[:pt:Lomba Grande]]</ref>\nIt is the Rural District of Novo Hamburgo, occupied an area of 156 square kilometers, making a total of two thirds of the municipal area. It is considered environmentally protected area where the wetlands of the [[Sinos River]] is very important for the preservation of the ecosystem, both [[fauna]] as [[flora]].\n\n[[Lomba Grande]] also received the first [[Germans|German]] [[immigrants]] who settled in the Hemp Linen factory, then owned by the municipality of [[Sao Leopoldo]].

The neighborhood also has many cultural attractions such as [[church (building)|churches]], [[cemeteries]] and a roadmap that includes visits to artists.\n\n==Economy and society==\n\nThe [[Germans|German]] craftsmen eventually started to manufacture shoes and machinery on a large scale and in the 1960s began to export goods, a process that transformed the city into a magnet for internal immigrants from impoverished areas around the state and the country. This caused significant demographic growth that was not accompanied by the infrastructure needed to accommodate the recently arrived population; [[favelas]] then formed, which are the source of many of today's social problems.\nToday's Novo Hamburgo depends heavily upon shoe exports, although it diversified its industrial and commercial base in the early 1990s.\n\n==Newspapers==\n<ref>https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:h2b2d1ZZERgJ:paginas.ufrgs.br/alcar/encontros-nacionais-1/2o-encontro-2004-1/A%2520HISTORIA%2520DO%2520JORNALISMO%2520EM%2520NOVO%2520HAMBURGO.doc+jornal+monoclo+novo+hamburgo&hl=en&gl=ie&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg7VbgAlmKl69YlkA6WJ204m2o4hL9Dw6bKd0txK1619LF8sFwN90VavRSxwN7379hg3bFvdibkShHMy3wXw4aNT60jwieXa1o4Ccx1WlxXkyHGzWdl1cmJe24EIKVu5G2etLCK&sig=AHIEtbQ9D-3CjLWfCtWu_4K4wqb_4bL28A</ref>\nIn 1918 the first newspaper called the Monoclo was registered and circulated, the paper was directed by Arnaldo Mayer and distributed on Saturdays.

Today, with more than 250,000 inhabitants, Novo Hamburgo is the seventh most populated city in the state.

On 14 April 1874, the first train track between [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Sao Leopoldo]] was completed. This was constructed by a British Company called ''[[The Porto Alegre & New Hamburg Brazilian Railway Company Limited]]''. Owned by Johan Mac Ginity.\n\nThe first train arrived in Novo Hamburgo on 1 January 1876. The station was named Novo Hamburgo Station. The railway did not go through the village of [[Hamburguer Berg]], the station was built some 3&nbsp;km away thus, a new urban area began to develop around the railway station. Only in 1882 the Novo Hamburgo station was connected at the village which was named as Hamburguer Berg, this line eventually was extended to [[Canela, Rio Grande do Sul|Canela]] in 1922.\n\nIn 1919, the Novo Hamburgo station was renamed Borges de Medeiros, reflecting the anti-German sentiment caused by Great War and also Hamburg Berg was renamed Genuine Sampaio. However, Novo Hamburgo station returned to the original name in 1920 and Hamburguer Berg received its current name of [[Hamburgo Velho]].\n\nIn 1964, the Novo Hamburgo to [[Taquara]] line was closed, leaving Novo Hamburgo station as the end point of the line. In late 1966, the rest of section, Rio dos Sinos to Novo Hamburgo stations was abolished and the station was deactivated.\n\nIn 2008 the Federal government authorized the expansion of [[Porto Alegre Metro]] train services to Novo Hamburgo. The works started in early 2009 and is expected to be completed 2013. This project includes the construction of an additional 9.3 kilometres and four new stations: Rio dos Sinos, in the municipality of [[S\u00e3o Leopoldo]], Liberdade, Fenac and Novo Hamburgo, in the city of Novo Hamburgo.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Maicon (footballer born 1981)|Maicon]] (born 1981), football player\n* [[Muriel Gustavo Becker]] (born 1987), football player\n* [[Alisson (footballer, born 1992)|Alisson]], football player\n* [[Matheus Leist]], racing driver\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Novo Hamburgo}}\n* [http://www.novohamburgo.rs.gov.br Novo Hamburgo Local Government]\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=novo+hamburgo,+brazil&ie=UTF8&z=13&om=1 Novo Hamburgo detailed city Street Map]\n\n{{Municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul}}\n{{Rota Rom\u00e2ntica}}\n\n[[Category:Novo Hamburgo]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1832]]\n[[Category:German-Brazilian culture]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: stadium have built \u2192 stadium was built", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novo_Hamburgo"}

He made his first team debut in 1984, when he was only 18 years old. CSKA of the late 1980s was the football \"alma mater\" to several Bulgarian players like Hristo Stoichkov who made it to the international top in the 1990s. During those days Lubo's teammates included defender [[Trifon Ivanov]], winger [[Emil Kostadinov]], and striker [[Hristo Stoichkov]]. With CSKA Penev won the [[Bulgarian A Football Group]] twice (in 1987 and 1989) and the [[Bulgarian Cup]] three times (in 1987, 1988 and 1989). He was also voted as the [[Bulgarian Footballer of the Year]] in 1988.\n\nIn 1989, after reaching stardom in the Bulgarian football, he took an important step in his career by moving to the [[La Liga|Spanish League]]. In Primera Penev played for four different clubs: [[Valencia CF]], [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[SD Compostela]] and [[Celta Vigo]]. The highlight of the Spanish years was the 1995\u20131996 season with Atl\u00e9tico, when the club conquered both the league championship and the [[Copa del Rey|Spanish Cup]]. Penev was the most efficient player of the \"double squad\" by scoring 22 goals in 44 games (including both league and cup matches).\n\n==International career==\nPenev represented [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in [[1996 European Football Championship]] in [[England]] and in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in [[France]]. He could not take part in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], as he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer since the beginning of 1994. For the same reason he was replaced by [[Nasko Sirakov]] during the match Bulgaria vs [[Romanian national football team|Romania]] at [[UEFA Euro 1996]] in England.\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn March 2009, he succeeded his uncle [[Dimitar Penev]] as manager of [[CSKA Sofia]] and under his guidance the team qualified for the group stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]], defeating [[FC Dynamo Moscow]] \u2013 2\u20131 on aggregate. On 6 November 2009, he gave his resignation, after a 1\u20133 loss to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] side [[FC Basel]] due to a conflict with the club's owners. CSKA finished 4th in the group behind [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[FC Basel|Basel]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. CSKA won its single point in the opening game against the future [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|finalist]] Fulham (1\u20131 after a good strike from [[Michel Platini Mesquita|Michel Platini]] and a mistake from CSKA goalkeeper [[Ivan Karadzhov]]). However, Penev's resignation was not accepted, because the CSKA fans wanted him to stay.\n\nThe club was leader in the [[2009\u201310 A PFG|Bulgarian championship]] before the last round, when [[Litex Lovech]] took the leadership. On 13 January 2010, after another clash with the owners, he was fired. After the lost game against [[Minyor Pernik]] he withdrew nine players from training sessions for breaking the club's rules, this led to the conflict with the owners.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-11-02-2949830327_x.htm CSKA Sofia suspends 9 players for partying]</ref>\n\nDuring the summer many rumours connected him with a transfer to a Spanish clubs (mainly from [[Liga Adelante]], but from [[Liga BBVA]] sides too), but he remained a free agent. On 2 September 2010, he became manager of Litex Lovech and won the 2010\u20132011 A PFG Group [[2010\u201311 A PFG|championship]].\n\nOn 23 October 2011, he resigned as Litex Lovech coach and was appointed manager of the [[Bulgaria national football team|national team]]. In his first game in charge, on 29 February 2012, Bulgaria earned a 1\u20131 draw away to [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. On 26 May 2012 his team defeated the runners-up of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Amsterdam by a score of 2\u20131. Under his management, Bulgaria's fortunes picked up and the team put in credible performances against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the qualifications for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. As a result, Bulgaria climbed from 96th in the FIFA World rankings when Penev took over, to 40th in November 2012. Currently, Bulgaria stand second in Group B on 13 points.

[[Football(soccer)|football]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and former player.\n\n==Career==\nPenev's first professional team was [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] of the Bulgarian capital. He made his first team debut in 1984, when he was only 18 years old. CSKA of the late 1980s was the football \"alma mater\" to several Bulgarian players like Hristo Stoichkov who made it to the international top in the 1990s. During those days Lubo's teammates included defender [[Trifon Ivanov]], winger [[Emil Kostadinov]], and striker [[Hristo Stoichkov]]. With CSKA Penev won the [[Bulgarian A Football Group]] twice (in 1987 and 1989) and the [[Bulgarian Cup]] three times (in 1987, 1988 and 1989). He was also voted as the [[Bulgarian Footballer of the Year]] in 1988.\n\nIn 1989, after reaching stardom in the Bulgarian football, he took an important step in his career by moving to the [[La Liga|Spanish League]]. In Primera Penev played for four different clubs: [[Valencia CF]], [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[SD Compostela]] and [[Celta Vigo]]. The highlight of the Spanish years was the 1995\u20131996 season with Atl\u00e9tico, when the club conquered both the league championship and the [[Copa del Rey|Spanish Cup]]. Penev was the most efficient player of the \"double squad\" by scoring 22 goals in 44 games (including both league and cup matches).\n\n==International career==\nPenev represented [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in [[1996 European Football Championship]] in [[England]] and in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in [[France]]. He could not take part in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], as he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer since the beginning of 1994. For the same reason he was replaced by [[Nasko Sirakov]] during the match Bulgaria vs [[Romanian national football team|Romania]] at [[UEFA Euro 1996]] in England.\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn March 2009, he succeeded his uncle [[Dimitar Penev]] as manager of [[CSKA Sofia]] and under his guidance the team qualified for the group stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]], defeating [[FC Dynamo Moscow]] \u2013 2\u20131 on aggregate. On 6 November 2009, he gave his resignation, after a 1\u20133 loss to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] side [[FC Basel]] due to a conflict with the club's owners. CSKA finished 4th in the group behind [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[FC Basel|Basel]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. CSKA won its single point in the opening game against the future [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|finalist]] Fulham (1\u20131 after a good strike from [[Michel Platini Mesquita|Michel Platini]] and a mistake from CSKA goalkeeper [[Ivan Karadzhov]]). However, Penev's resignation was not accepted, because the CSKA fans wanted him to stay.\n\nThe club was leader in the [[2009\u201310 A PFG|Bulgarian championship]] before the last round, when [[Litex Lovech]] took the leadership. On 13 January 2010, after another clash with the owners, he was fired. After the lost game against [[Minyor Pernik]] he withdrew nine players from training sessions for breaking the club's rules, this led to the conflict with the owners.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-11-02-2949830327_x.htm CSKA Sofia suspends 9 players for partying]</ref>\n\nDuring the summer many rumours connected him with a transfer to a Spanish clubs (mainly from [[Liga Adelante]], but from [[Liga BBVA]] sides too), but he remained a free agent. On 2 September 2010, he became manager of Litex Lovech and won the 2010\u20132011 A PFG Group [[2010\u201311 A PFG|championship]].\n\nOn 23 October 2011, he resigned as Litex Lovech coach and was appointed manager of the [[Bulgaria national football team|national team]]. In his first game in charge, on 29 February 2012, Bulgaria earned a 1\u20131 draw away to [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. On 26 May 2012 his team defeated the runners-up of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Amsterdam by a score of 2\u20131. Under his management, Bulgaria's fortunes picked up and the team put in credible performances against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the qualifications for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. As a result, Bulgaria climbed from 96th in the FIFA World rankings when Penev took over, to 40th in November 2012. Currently, Bulgaria stand second in Group B on 13 points.

Additionally, it features a vast array of modern architecture, with around 60 skyscrapers over 100&nbsp;m in the [[Melbourne city centre|city centre]] which have deliberately been set back from thoroughfares and streets to preserve historic architecture\u2014leading to the title of \"Australia's most European city\".\n\nMelbourne prospered significantly after the discovery of gold in the 1850s, which led to a [[Gold Rush]] that brought a prolonged period of wealth and grandeur to the city&ndash;for a period of time it was one of the wealthiest cities in the [[British Empire]], second only to London. This is reflected in much of the ornamentation of architecture and its flourishing Victorian era periods which led to some of the most prolific edifices in Australia's early history. For some time up until the early 20th century, it was Australia's most populous city until overtaken by [[Sydney]]. Melbourne is also said to have anticipated the skyscraper race alongside [[Chicago]] and New York City,<ref>{{cite news|title=New Buildings in Melbourne: The Loftiest Structures in the City|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/6132483?searchTerm=new%20building%20loftiest&searchLimits=l-decade=188||||accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=The Argus|date=14 June 1888}}</ref> with the construction of the Queen Anne [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA (Australia) Building]], sometimes referred to as one of the world's tallest buildings in the 1890s, Australia's tallest building until 1912 and Melbourne's tallest building until 1929. Slipshod government and council attitudes towards heritage in the 1950s, 60s and 70s led to the destruction of most of the city's early architecture, although some edifices have been retained, specifically the [[Royal Exhibition Building]], the Melbourne [[Melbourne GPO|General Post Office]], the [[State Library of Victoria]] and a number of [[:Category:Churches in Melbourne|churches and cathedrals]].\n\nEngineering developments led to Melbourne's status as a port city, and due to the location on the [[Yarra River]] and the inability to navigate it, ships had to be unloaded at [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] (formerly Hobson's Bay) and [[Sandridge, Victoria|Sandridge]]. English engineer [[Sir John Coode]] oversaw the construction of Victoria Dock in swampland to the west of the city in 1889. The postwar period of Melbourne saw a regeneration of the city's economy and a successful bid to host the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. Around this time, the construction of the skyscraper [[ICI House]] led to the city entering a contemporary style of high-rise architectural development similar to that of North America and Asia.\n\nThe juxtaposition of old and new has given Melbourne a reputation as a city of no characterising architectural style, but rather an accumulation of buildings dating from the present back until the [[European settlement of Australia]]. The city is also home to [[Eureka Tower]] (2006), which was the tallest residential tower when measured to its highest floor for some time.<ref name=TallestRes>{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/List/tallest-residential-100-buildings |title=100 Tallest Residential Buildings in the World |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Melbourne}}\n{{Further|Victorian gold rush}}\n\n===Boom era (1840s\u20131890s)===\nMelbourne was first settled in 1835, after the discovery of fresh water in the [[Yarra River]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Founding of Melbourne, 1835|work=[[Museum of Victoria]]|accessdate=12 December 2017|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/6775}}</ref> The land to the north of the Yarra was considerably flat, while low-lying mountain ranges lay to the west, east and north, with small streams running through the plains of the city, down to the Yarra.

The town was largely developed by [[John Batman]] and [[John Pascoe Fawkner]], two Tasmanians who surveyed and purchased land in the 1830s. Until the 1850s, the settlement of Melbourne grew at a moderate but steady pace and its population increased. Following this early settlement period, [[gold]] was discovered and masses of people flocked to the city's port from Europe and the United States, in order to dig from the alluvial [[Gold mining|goldfields]] discovered across Victoria. As a result of the [[Gold Rush]], Melbourne's population grew from 4,000 in 1837 to 300,000 in 1854.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|2014|pp=7}} Approximately \u00a3100 million worth of gold was discovered in the Victorian fields in the 1850s.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|2014|pp=7}} During this time, those who immigrated to the city became caterers to the miners, as well as entrepreneurs establishing businesses across the city. Because of the accumulating wealth of Melbourne, many prominent buildings were established on public land allocated by Surveyor Hoddle. These included the [[State Library of Victoria|State Library]], [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]], the [[Melbourne Town Hall|Town Hall]], and the [[Melbourne GPO|General Post Office]].

In 1886, the vice-president of the American [[Otis Elevator Company]], W.F. Hall, visited Melbourne. In conversation with Prell, Hall noticed that Sydney had six Otis elevator lifts in operation in public buildings, however Melbourne had none. He remarked that men who had to climb stairs in Melbourne's offices would do so with great difficulty, reaching the top floor with \"aching legs, a fluttering heart, and a firm resolution to do business elsewhere\".{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=95}} Prell added two more storeys to his building, as well as Victoria's first passenger elevators. Between 1888 and 1889, three 11-storey buildings were constructed in Queens and Collins Streets. The buildings, known as Prell's buildings, dominated the southern section of the city with their Modern Renaissance style, and were known as \"Towers of Babel of the elevator type. The buildings were constructed in brick or stone with ornamented cornices. The building was generally used for commercial offices. The Prell's buildings were demolished in 1975, for \"no sound reason\".{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=95}}\n\nThe Craig, Williamson and Thomas buildings were department stores that sold goods including robes, silks and satins, until a fire broke out on 22 November 1897 and destroyed much of the building's interior, creating a damage bill of \u00a31,500,000 and a stock los of \u00a3100,000.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=76}} The facade was preserved, and extended, before the building was sold in 1946, after ten years on the market.

Durham, Post Master General and director of the biscuit company Swallow and Ariell. The APA Building was constructed between 1888&ndash;89 in the [[Queen Anne Revival architecture|Queen Anne]] architectural style, with a gabled roofline, walkway, pinnacles and decorative masonry. It was built in red and cream horizontal bands, with shops and offices occupying most floors. Hydraulic lifts were added to the building and opened by the premier, [[Alfred Deakin]]. As the building neared completion, Melbourne's land boom was dissipating and the city entered an economic depression. Office space became considerably difficult to lease. Durham's assets were purchased greater than their market value by the Munro's Real Estate Bank, which helped secure his company. The top floor and pinnacles were removed in the 1950s. The building itself was demolished in 1981, supposedly because it was a \"fire hazard\", and the owners refused to pay the $2 million for fire insurance.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=100}}\n\nThe [[Federal Coffee Palace]], a [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] style building on Collins Street, was constructed in 1883. At the time of opening, an article in ''[[The Age]]'' declared it as one of \"Australia's most splendid\" buildings. It was commissioned by politicians and property developers James munro and James Mirams. The exterior was designed by Ellerker and Killburn, and the interior by William Pitt in a joint venture. At a cost of \u00a3150,000, the building became one of Melbourne's grand ornamented hotels. A preference for modern American hotels saw the death of old world establishments like the Federal Hotel and despite public outcry and petitions, it was demolished in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=89}} A similar fate was met by other grand buildings of this era, including the smaller scale Melbourne Queen Victoria Hospital (1848&ndash;1994), the 10-storey Fink's Building (1888&ndash;1967), Scott's Hotel (1837&ndash;1962), Victoria Building and Queens Walk Arcade (1888&ndash;1960s), APA Tower (1880s&ndash;1967), the Fish Markets (1892&ndash;1959) and the Tivoli Opera House (1866&ndash;1969).{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=144}}[[File:Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Exhibition Building]] (1879), a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/20/1034561388451.html \"Global status for our greatest building\"], 21 October 2002.

The act went onto specify the prohibition of \"pulling down\", \"removal\" or \"decoration or defacement\" to any such building. Because only specified sites were to be protected, the local councils across Melbourne had the task of allocating buildings and places that warranted protection. The [[City of Melbourne]] council specified the entire CBD as an area of significance in 1973. However, this blanket protection measure came unstuck in 1975 when the council was threatened with compensation payments to developers if their plans were rejected on heritage grounds. Despite this, most of the cities heritage buildings were already protected by that time under the authority of the Historic Buildings Act. However, the act involved representatives from real estate and [[corrupt]] development industries with ulterior motives.

The postwar period of Melbourne saw a regeneration of the city's economy and a successful bid to host the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. Around this time, the construction of the skyscraper [[ICI House]] led to the city entering a contemporary style of high-rise architectural development similar to that of North America and Asia.\n\nThe juxtaposition of old and new has given Melbourne a reputation as a city of no characterising architectural style, but rather an accumulation of buildings dating from the present back until the [[European settlement of Australia]].

The town was largely developed by [[John Batman]] and [[John Pascoe Fawkner]], two Tasmanians who surveyed and purchased land in the 1830s. Until the 1850s, the settlement of Melbourne grew at a moderate but steady pace and its population increased. Following this early settlement period, [[gold]] was discovered and masses of people flocked to the city's port from Europe and the United States, in order to dig from the alluvial [[Gold mining|goldfields]] discovered across Victoria. As a result of the [[Gold Rush]], Melbourne's population grew from 4,000 in 1837 to 300,000 in 1854.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|2014|pp=7}} Approximately \u00a3100 million worth of gold was discovered in the Victorian fields in the 1850s.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|2014|pp=7}} During this time, those who immigrated to the city became caterers to the miners, as well as entrepreneurs establishing businesses across the city. Because of the accumulating wealth of Melbourne, many prominent buildings were established on public land allocated by Surveyor Hoddle. These included the [[State Library of Victoria|State Library]], [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]], the [[Melbourne Town Hall|Town Hall]], and the [[Melbourne GPO|General Post Office]].

The buildings, known as Prell's buildings, dominated the southern section of the city with their Modern Renaissance style, and were known as \"Towers of Babel of the elevator type.

These structures were built in the late 1960s at a time when modernisation of the city was considered favourable.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=124}} The two towers, designed by Perrot and Parents, were also known as the Princes Gate Towers. As public opinion swayed back towards the desirability of 19th century heritage, the modernist Gas and Fuel Towers grew to be seen as \"ugly and featureless\", with no connection to the heritage that surrounded. The [[Jeff Kennett|Kennett Government's]] decision to demolish the modernist towers was generally met with approval, and the towers were demolished to make way for [[Federation Square]].{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=124}} A similar fate was met by Hotel Australia, built in a Functionalist/Moderne style in 1939 and demolished in 1989.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=110}} In 2008, one of the last remaining Victorian arcades in the Melbourne CBD was demolished under approval from the planning minister at the time [[Matthew Guy]]. The decision and the rapidity of the demolition created public outrage.{{sfn|Chapman|Stillman|pp=134}} The building, Eastern Arcade and Apollo Hall, built in 1872, was constructed on the site of the old Haymarket Theatre. It was the third arcade to be built in Melbourne and larger than both Queen's Arcade and the [[Royal Arcade, Melbourne|Royal Arcade]]. The Eastern Arcade was designed by George Johnston and had 68 stores as well as an upper storey. Despite discussions held by the [[Melbourne City Council]] to preserve the building or at least its facade, the entire structure was torn down in 2008.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:35 and 55 from Collins Street.JPG|Collins Place\nFile:120CollinsSt.jpg|120 Collins Street\nFile:530 Collins Street.jpg|530 Collins Street\nFile:Rialto Towers.jpg|Rialto Towers\n</gallery>\n\n===New millennium architecture===\n[[File:Melbourne Central Coops Shot Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|The interior of [[Melbourne Central Shopping Centre|Melbourne Central]], a mixed-use skyscraper that features an underground railway station and shopping mall.]]\nThe new millennium saw a tighter attitude towards heritage conservation and a construction boom in Melbourne.

He created the character [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887 when he published ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', the first of four novels and more than fifty short stories about Holmes and [[Dr. Watson]]. The Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].\n\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about [[Professor Challenger]] and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier [[Brigadier Gerard]], as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.\n\n== Name ==\nDoyle is often referred to as \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" or \"Conan Doyle\", implying that \"Conan\" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh, gives \"Arthur Ignatius Conan\" as his given names and \"Doyle\" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of \"Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 20\u201321). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as \"A. Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 70).</ref> The catalogues of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat \"Doyle\" alone as his surname.<ref>Redmond, Christopher (2009).

The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]] who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals in [[Great Wyrley]]. Police were set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed.<ref>''International Commentary on Evidence'', Volume 4, Issue 2 2006 Article 3, Boxes in Boxes: Julian Bardes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case, D.

In Nicholas Meyer's pastiche ''[[The West End Horror]]'' (1976), Holmes manages to help clear the name of a shy [[Parsi]] Indian character wronged by the English justice system. Edalji was of Parsi heritage on his father's side. The story was fictionalised in [[Julian Barnes]]'s 2005 novel ''[[Arthur and George]]'', which was adapted into a three-part drama by ITV in 2015.\n\nThe second case, that of [[Oscar Slater]], a Jew of German origin who operated a gambling-den, convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in [[Glasgow]] in 1908, excited Doyle's curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was not guilty.

He was initiated as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] (26 January 1887) at the Phoenix Lodge No. 257 in Southsea. He resigned from the Lodge in 1889, but returned to it in 1902, only to resign again in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner10.html|title=Arthur Conan Doyle, Spiritualist and Freemason|last=Beresiner|first=Yasha|date=2007|work=Masonic papers|publisher=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|accessdate=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309065258/http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner10.html|archive-date=9 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlso in Southsea in 1887, influenced by a member of the Portsmouth Literary and Philosophical Society, Major-General [[Alfred Wilks Drayson]], he began a series of psychic investigations. These included attending around 20 [[seance]]s, experiments in [[telepathy]] and sittings with mediums. Writing to [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] journal ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'', that year, he declared himself to be a Spiritualist and spoke of one particular psychic event that had convinced him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wingett |first=Matt |title=Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light, 1887\u20131920 |publisher=Life Is Amazing |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-9572413-5-0 |pages=19\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThough he later wavered, he remained fascinated by the [[paranormal]].

''The New Revelation'' was the title of his first Spiritualist work, published two years later. In the intervening years, he wrote to ''Light'' magazine about his faith and lectured frequently on the truth of Spiritualism.\n\nWar-related deaths close to him certainly strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication, though it is wrong to claim that the death of his son, Kingsley, turned him to Spiritualism, as is often stated. Doyle came out as a Spiritualist to the public in 1916, a full two years before his son's death.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was on 28 October 1918 that Kingsley died from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]].

W. Hornung]], creator of the literary character [[A. J. Raffles|Raffles]]) and his two nephews also died shortly after the war. His second book on Spiritualism, ''[[The Vital Message]]'', appeared in 1919.\n\nDoyle found solace supporting spiritualism and its attempts to find proof of [[Afterlife|existence beyond the grave]]. In particular, according to some,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Did Conan Doyle Go Too Far? |journal=Psychic News|first=Leslie|last=Price|issue=4037|year=2010}}</ref> he favoured [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualism]] and encouraged the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] to accept an eighth precept \u2013 that of following the teachings and example of Jesus of Nazareth.

Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers\u2014a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''.

He was initially not considered the perpetrator of the hoax because it was seen as too elaborate for him. DNA evidence, however, showed that the tooth discovered in 1915 by Charles Dawson at an entirely different site came from the same jaw as the original skull and jawbone of the Piltdown Man, suggesting he had planted them both. The tooth discovered in 1915 has also since been proven to be a hoax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/research/projects/piltdown-man|title=Piltdown Man|website=www.bournemouth.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nDr Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: \u201cConan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition. He wanted to be a member of the Royal Society and he was after an MBE. He wanted people to stop seeing him as an amateur.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/08/10/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-cleared-of-piltdown-man-hoax/|title=Sir Arthur Conan Doyle cleared of Piltdown Man hoax|last=Knapton|first=Sarah|date=2016-08-10|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-11-18|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:UndershawCirca1900.jpg|thumb|Fa\u00e7ade of [[Undershaw]] with Doyle's children, Mary and Kingsley, on the drive]]\nDoyle commissioned a newly-built home from Joseph Henry Ball, an architect friend, in 1895, and played an active part of the design process.<ref>Cooke, Simon, 2013, [http://www.victorianweb.org/art/illustration/doylecharles/cooke.html Introduction: Life and Controversy], \"Charles Altamont Doyle,\" The Victorian Web</ref><ref>Historic England, 1977 (amended 2014), Reasons for Designation \u2013 Architectural Interest, \"Undershaw List Entry,\" 1244471, National Heritage List for England (NHLE).</ref> He lived in ''[[Undershaw]]'' which is near [[Hindhead]] in Surrey from October 1897 to September 1907.<ref>{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Alistair|title=An Entirely New Country: Arthur Conan Doyle, Undershaw and the Resurrection of Sherlock Holmes|publisher=MX Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-908218-19-3}}</ref> It was a hotel and restaurant from 1924 until 2004, when it was bought by a developer and stood empty while conservationists and Doyle fans fought to preserve it.<ref name=\"Leeman\" /> In 2012, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London ruled the redevelopment permission be quashed because proper procedure had not been followed,<ref name=\"BBC121112\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-20303200|title=Sir Arthur Conan Doyle house development appeal upheld|date=12 November 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116032748/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-20303200|archive-date=16 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> but it is now due to become part of the Stepping Stones school for children with disabilities and additional needs.\n\nDoyle was staying at the [[Glasshayes|Lyndhurst Grand Hotel]] during March 1912 and made his most ambitious foray into architecture: sketching the original designs for a third storey extension and altering the front facade to the building.<ref>Griffith, Carolyn. \"Campaigner says hotel's writer link should secure landmark building\" Lymington Times, 15 September 2017</ref> Work began later that year and the building was a near perfect expression of Doyle's plans.

He created the character [[Sherlock Holmes]] in 1887 when he published ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', the first of four novels and more than fifty short stories about Holmes and [[Dr. Watson]]. The Sherlock Holmes stories are generally considered milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].\n\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about [[Professor Challenger]] and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier [[Brigadier Gerard]], as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.\n\n== Name ==\nDoyle is often referred to as \"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\" or \"Conan Doyle\", implying that \"Conan\" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh, gives \"Arthur Ignatius Conan\" as his given names and \"Doyle\" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of \"Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 20\u201321). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as \"A. Conan Doyle\" (Stashower 70).</ref> The catalogues of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat \"Doyle\" alone as his surname.<ref>Redmond, Christopher (2009).

Vienna was suggested by his friend Vernon Morris as a place to spend six months and train to be an eye surgeon. Doyle found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms at the classes in Vienna and quickly quit his studies there. For the rest of his two-month stay in Vienna, he pursued other activities, such as [[ice skating]] with his wife Louisa and drinking with Brinsley Richards of the London ''Times''. He also wrote ''The Doings of Raffles Haw''.\n\nAfter visiting [[Venice]] and [[Milan]], he spent a few days in Paris observing Edmund Landolt, an expert on diseases of the eye.

''The New Revelation'' was the title of his first Spiritualist work, published two years later. In the intervening years, he wrote to ''Light'' magazine about his faith and lectured frequently on the truth of Spiritualism.\n\nWar-related deaths close to him certainly strengthened his long-held belief in life after death and spirit communication, though it is wrong to claim that the death of his son, Kingsley, turned him to Spiritualism, as is often stated. Doyle came out as a Spiritualist to the public in 1916, a full two years before his son's death.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was on 28 October 1918 that Kingsley died from pneumonia contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded in the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]].

Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers\u2014a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''.

DNA evidence, however, showed that the tooth discovered in 1915 by Charles Dawson at an entirely different site came from the same jaw as the original skull and jawbone of the Piltdown Man, suggesting he had planted them both. The tooth discovered in 1915 has also since been proven to be a hoax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/research/projects/piltdown-man|title=Piltdown Man|website=www.bournemouth.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nDr Chris Stringer, an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum, was quoted as saying: \u201cConan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area, but he was a public man and very busy and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time [to create the hoax]. So there are some coincidences, but I think they are just coincidences. When you look at the fossil evidence you can only associate Dawson with all the finds, and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious. He wanted professional recognition.
