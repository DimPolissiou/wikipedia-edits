Technical specifications introduced as HTML 5 extensions such as [[Polyglot markup]] have also been standardized as modules. Some W3C specifications that were originally separate specifications have been adapted as HTML 5 extensions or features, such as [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]. Some features that might have slowed down the standardization of HTML 5 will be standardized as upcoming specifications, instead. HTML 5.1 was finalized in 2016, and it is currently on the standardization track at the W3C.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Markup===\nHTML 5 introduces [[HTML element|elements]] and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites. Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block ({{tag|div|open}}) and inline ({{tag|span|open}}) elements, for example {{tag|nav|open}} (website navigation block), {{tag|footer|open}} (usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code), or {{tag|audio|open}} and {{tag|video|open}} instead of {{tag|object|open}}.<ref>Introduction to HTML 5 [http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-html5-video/ video]</ref><ref>IBM Developer Works [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/?ca=dgr-lnxw01NewHTML New elements in HTML5: Structure and semantics]</ref><ref>ICAMD.org [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H05Q18 Finalcut Silverlight Films that Videographers share Quicktime in a Flash: Video on the Web using HTML5 and other Codecs]</ref>\nSome deprecated elements from [[HTML&nbsp;4.01]] have been dropped, including purely presentational elements such as {{tag|font|open}} and {{tag|center|open}}, whose effects have long been superseded by the more capable [[Cascading Style Sheets]].<ref>\n {{cite web\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html\n | title = 11 Obsolete features \u2013 HTML5\n | publisher = W3C\n | accessdate = 11 March 2014}}</ref> There is also a renewed emphasis on the importance of [[DOM scripting]] in Web behavior.\n\nThe HTML 5 syntax is no longer based on [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]]<ref>[http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html5-dtd.html HTML5 DTD]: \"HTML5 is not SGML-based, and there will be no official DTD for it.\"</ref><ref>[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/ HTML 5 Reference]: \"Although it is inspired by its SGML origins, in practice, it really only shares minor syntactic similarities. ...

It has, however, been designed to be backward-compatible with common parsing of older versions of HTML.

In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to \"Last Call\", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.<ref name=\"w3c2014\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.w3.org/2011/02/htmlwg-pr.html\n|title=W3C Confirms May 2011 for HTML5 Last Call, Targets 2014 for HTML5 Standard\n|publisher= [[World Wide Web Consortium]]\n|accessdate=18 February 2011\n|date=14 February 2011}}</ref> In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its \"HTML5\" specification ''HTML Living Standard''.

W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a \"snapshot\" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization continues its work with HTML5 as a \"living standard\". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved.

Technical specifications introduced as HTML 5 extensions such as [[Polyglot markup]] have also been standardized as modules. Some W3C specifications that were originally separate specifications have been adapted as HTML 5 extensions or features, such as [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]. Some features that might have slowed down the standardization of HTML 5 will be standardized as upcoming specifications, instead. HTML 5.1 was finalized in 2016, and it is currently on the standardization track at the W3C.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Markup===\nHTML 5 introduces [[HTML element|elements]] and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites. Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block ({{tag|div|open}}) and inline ({{tag|span|open}}) elements, for example {{tag|nav|open}} (website navigation block), {{tag|footer|open}} (usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code), or {{tag|audio|open}} and {{tag|video|open}} instead of {{tag|object|open}}.<ref>Introduction to HTML 5 [http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-html5-video/ video]</ref><ref>IBM Developer Works [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/?ca=dgr-lnxw01NewHTML New elements in HTML5: Structure and semantics]</ref><ref>ICAMD.org [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003H05Q18 Finalcut Silverlight Films that Videographers share Quicktime in a Flash: Video on the Web using HTML5 and other Codecs]</ref>\nSome deprecated elements from [[HTML&nbsp;4.01]] have been dropped, including purely presentational elements such as {{tag|font|open}} and {{tag|center|open}}, whose effects have long been superseded by the more capable [[Cascading Style Sheets]].<ref>\n {{cite web\n | url = https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html\n | title = 11 Obsolete features \u2013 HTML5\n | publisher = W3C\n | accessdate = 11 March 2014}}</ref> There is also a renewed emphasis on the importance of [[DOM scripting]] in Web behavior.\n\nThe HTML 5 syntax is no longer based on [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]]<ref>[http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html5-dtd.html HTML5 DTD]: \"HTML5 is not SGML-based, and there will be no official DTD for it.\"</ref><ref>[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/ HTML 5 Reference]: \"Although it is inspired by its SGML origins, in practice, it really only shares minor syntactic similarities. ...

Initially, the revolutionaries alleged that SAVAK intelligence agents were in pursuit of individuals who ran into the theatre and used it as an opportunity to hide in a large crowd there. Later, the fugitives (or the SAVAK agents chasing them) locked the doors of the cinema. Unable to escape from the building, everyone inside the cinema died in the conflagration. The Iranian newspaper ''Sobhe Emruz'' blamed radical Islamists in an editorial addressing Kayhan newspaper run by Shariatmadari (Shariatmadari has been described as being \"a close confidant of Iran\u2019s supreme leader\" [[Ali Khamenei]], and as having \"links\" to Iran's intelligence services), Sobhe Emruz wrote  \"Don't make us disclose who were really behind the Cinema Rex fire.\" addressing Kayhan during Khatami's presidency early 2000.

The new Iranian government arrested Captain Monir Taheri, who was accused by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Rudsar of having received guerrilla training in the [[United States]]. Taheri's defense maintained that he had never visited Abadan and that he was in [[Ahvaz]] at the time of the blaze. The tribunal found Taheri guilty and executed him shortly thereafter on 23 February 1979.<ref name=\"iranrights\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranrights.org/memorial/story/-3246/monir-taheri#sthash.sewuJ1eT.dpbs |title=Mr. Monir Taheri - Iran Human Rights Memorial |publisher=Iranrights.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Books and references ==\n[[Dilip Hiro|Dillip Hiro]], author of ''Iran Under the Ayatollahs'', said that anti-[[Shah of Iran|shah]] groups were not likely to have caused the fire, since the Cinema Rex was located in a working-class neighbourhood and was showing the film ''[[The Deer (1974 film)|Gavaznha]],'' starring well-known actor [[Behrouz Vossoughi]], which Hiro claimed had \"passed the censors with considerable difficulty.\" Hiro also said that the deliberate closure of the cinema doors and the local fire station's efforts, which he described as \"tepid\", strengthened the public belief that the Shah had the cinema burned.<ref name=\"Hiro74\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Roy Mottahedeh]], author of ''The Mantle of the Prophet'', \"thousands of [[Persian people|Iranians]] who had felt neutral and had until now thought that the struggle was only between the shah and supporters of religiously conservative mullahs felt that the government might put their own lives on the block to save itself. Suddenly, for hundreds of thousands, the movement was their own business.\"<ref name=mottahedeh>Mottahedeh, Roy (2004). ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', page 375.</ref>\n\nAccording to Middle East expert [[Daniel Byman|Daniel L. Byman]], \"The movies were an affront to God, encouraging vice and Western-style decadence. So in August 1978, four Shiite revolutionaries locked the doors of the Cinema Rex in the Iranian city of Abadan and set the theater on fire\u2026\"<ref name=\"Byman\">{{cite web|last1=L.

Many elements of the revolutionary bloc laid blame on [[Mohammad Reza Shah]], the now deposed monarch of Iran, and SAVAK (''Sazeman-e Ettelaat va Amniyat-e Keshvar''), the country's domestic security and intelligence service. Although sufficient evidence was never brought forth to facilitate such claims, the labeling would have far-reaching implications on the subsequent direction of the revolutionary movement. The circumstances under which the fire was set did not aid the Shah's pleas of innocence. The location of the incident, an impoverished district of Abadan, and its timing did not coincide with preceding patterns of protest, which raised the level of suspicion.

Initially, the revolutionaries alleged that SAVAK intelligence agents were in pursuit of individuals who ran into the theatre and used it as an opportunity to hide in a large crowd there. Later, the fugitives (or the SAVAK agents chasing them) locked the doors of the cinema. Unable to escape from the building, everyone inside the cinema died in the conflagration. The Iranian newspaper ''Sobhe Emruz'' blamed radical Islamists in an editorial addressing Kayhan newspaper run by Shariatmadari (Shariatmadari has been described as being \"a close confidant of Iran\u2019s supreme leader\" [[Ali Khamenei]], and as having \"links\" to Iran's intelligence services), Sobhe Emruz wrote  \"Don't make us disclose who were really behind the Cinema Rex fire.\" addressing Kayhan during Khatami's presidency early 2000.

The new Iranian government arrested Captain Monir Taheri, who was accused by the Revolutionary Tribunal of Rudsar of having received guerrilla training in the [[United States]]. Taheri's defense maintained that he had never visited Abadan and that he was in [[Ahvaz]] at the time of the blaze. The tribunal found Taheri guilty and executed him shortly thereafter on 23 February 1979.<ref name=\"iranrights\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranrights.org/memorial/story/-3246/monir-taheri#sthash.sewuJ1eT.dpbs |title=Mr. Monir Taheri - Iran Human Rights Memorial |publisher=Iranrights.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Books and references ==\n[[Dilip Hiro|Dillip Hiro]], author of ''Iran Under the Ayatollahs'', said that anti-[[Shah of Iran|shah]] groups were not likely to have caused the fire, since the Cinema Rex was located in a working-class neighbourhood and was showing the film ''[[The Deer (1974 film)|Gavaznha]],'' starring well-known actor [[Behrouz Vossoughi]], which Hiro claimed had \"passed the censors with considerable difficulty.\" Hiro also said that the deliberate closure of the cinema doors and the local fire station's efforts, which he described as \"tepid\", strengthened the public belief that the Shah had the cinema burned.<ref name=\"Hiro74\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Roy Mottahedeh]], author of ''The Mantle of the Prophet'', \"thousands of [[Persian people|Iranians]] who had felt neutral and had until now thought that the struggle was only between the shah and supporters of religiously conservative mullahs felt that the government might put their own lives on the block to save itself. Suddenly, for hundreds of thousands, the movement was their own business.\"<ref name=mottahedeh>Mottahedeh, Roy (2004). ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', page 375.</ref>\n\nAccording to Middle East expert [[Daniel Byman|Daniel L. Byman]], \"The movies were an affront to God, encouraging vice and Western-style decadence. So in August 1978, four Shiite revolutionaries locked the doors of the Cinema Rex in the Iranian city of Abadan and set the theater on fire\u2026\"<ref name=\"Byman\">{{cite web|last1=L.

Many elements of the revolutionary bloc laid blame on [[Mohammad Reza Shah]], the now deposed monarch of Iran, and SAVAK (''Sazeman-e Ettelaat va Amniyat-e Keshvar''), the country's domestic security and intelligence service. Although sufficient evidence was never brought forth to facilitate such claims, the labeling would have far-reaching implications on the subsequent direction of the revolutionary movement. The circumstances under which the fire was set did not aid the Shah's pleas of innocence. The location of the incident, an impoverished district of Abadan, and its timing did not coincide with preceding patterns of protest, which raised the level of suspicion. It was also believed that the Shah specifically targeted Cinema Rex for the sole purpose of killing political dissidents who had gathered to watch the anti-government film playing there.<ref name=\"Answers\"/><ref name=\"Behrouz\">{{cite web\n |title=The unvanquished \n |work=Behrouz Vossoughi.com \n |url=http://www.behrouzvossoughi.com/bg.html \n |accessdate=21 August 2006 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023105512/http://www.behrouzvossoughi.com/bg.html \n |archivedate=23 October 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Payvand\">{{cite web\n | title=The hero and the heroin\n | work=Payvand\n | url=http://www.payvand.com/news/05/jul/1233.html\n | accessdate=21 August 2006\n}}</ref>\n\n===Public trial===\n\nLasting from 25 August to 4 September 1980, the Revolutionary Tribunal oversaw 17 court sessions that involved the trial of 26 individuals, including the only survivor of the four-man arson team, Hossein Takbalizadeh, who stated in his defense that he was an unemployed drug addict.

The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this [[monsoon]] activity. The more northern areas of the Gobi are very cold and dry, making it unable to support much plant growth; this cold and dry weather is attributed to Siberian-Mongolian high pressure cells.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, the icy [[Dust storm|sandstorms]] and [[Winter storm|snowstorms]] of spring and early summer<ref name=EB1911/> plus early January (winter).\n\n==Conservation, ecology, and economy==\nThe Gobi Desert is the source of many important fossils finds, including the first [[dinosaur eggs]], twenty-six of which, averaging 9 inches in length, were uncovered in 1923.<ref>B Ford, ''Too Big to Walk'' (London 2018) p. 216</ref>\n\nDespite the harsh conditions, these deserts and the surrounding regions sustain many animals, including [[black-tailed gazelle]]s, [[marbled polecat]]s, [[wild Bactrian camel]]s, [[Mongolian wild ass]] and [[Plover|sandplover]]s.

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n{{main|Eastern Gobi desert steppe}}\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Further south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens, and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places, they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants.

As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n{{main|Eastern Gobi desert steppe}}\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Further south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens, and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places, they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.<ref>Lattimore (1973), p. 238.</ref>}}\n\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}\u2013{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.

It was a strategically advantageous spot because of its location at entrance of the [[Trancura River|Trancura Valley]], where the Argentinean army had once pursued a group of Mapuches through [[Mamuil Malal Pass]] during the [[Conquest of the Desert]].\n \nThe first hotel in Puc\u00f3n was the Gudenschwager, established in 1923, but it was in 1934 with the establishment of Gran Hotel Puc\u00f3n that tourism became a popular activity in the area. In 1940 the first road between Villarrica and Puc\u00f3n was built and in the 1970s the road to [[Caburgua Lake]] was finished.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 2002 [[census]] carried out by the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|Chilean National Statistics Institute]], Puc\u00f3n spans an area of {{convert|1248.5|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has 21,107 inhabitants (10,705 men and 10,402 women). Of these, 13,837 (65.6%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 7,270 (34.4%) in [[rural area]]s.

Due to its striking natural surroundings which include volcanoes, lakes, waterfalls, nature reserves and hot springs, Puc\u00f3n attracts tourism all year round. During the summer, popular tourist activities include [[Hiking in Chile|hiking]], [[rafting]], horseback riding, bird watching, fishing, canopy trails, and canyoning. In winter and spring, it is possible to go skiing or snowboarding on the slopes of Villarrica volcano or visit one of the several thermal baths scattered around the nearby [[Valdivian temperate rain forest]]. These activities are easily arranged from the city itself, which harbours several tourist offices and travel agencies. Despite its relatively small urban area, accommodation infrastructure in Puc\u00f3n is well developed, ranging from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels. Chilean and international cuisine can be found in one of the several city restaurants. More recently, Puc\u00f3n has become a major destination for [[Holiday cottage|second home]] investments and amenity migration.<ref>[http://www.jsedimensions.org/wordpress/content/amenity-migration-a-comparative-study-of-the-italian-alps-and-the-chil-ean-andes_2012_03/ Borsdorf, A., Hidalgo, R., Zunino, H.

Other volcanoes in the area include [[Mocho-Choshuenco]], [[Quetrupill\u00e1n]] and [[Lan\u00edn]]. Villarrica has had more than 82 eruptions since 1558, the most recent of which occurred on March 3, 2015. It is possible to climb it throughout the year, if weather and volcanic activity permit. During winter, the summit is completely covered by snow, and offers views of at least seven of the surrounding lakes.\n\nEl Ca\u00f1i, meaning \u201csight that transforms\u201d, is a private protected area of 500 hectares belonging to a non-profit organization.<ref>[http://www.thisischile.cl/8495/2/hike-el-cani-near-pucon-chile-for-great-views-of-the-region/News.aspx Hike El Ca\u00f1i near Puc\u00f3n, Chile for great views of the region] www.thisischile.cl Thursday, February 21, 2013, retrieved 29 August 2013</ref> It contains [[Hiking in Chile|hiking trails]] through ancient [[Araucaria]]s, Lengas ([[Lenga Beech]]), [[Nothofagus dombeyi|Coigues]], old volcanic craters and lagoons.

The main river is the [[Trancura River|Trancura]], which is used for kayaking and rafting. There are different [[International Scale of River Difficulty|levels of difficulty]] on the river, from easy family rides through Level III rapids to more difficult rides through Level V rapids.\n\nThere are several hot springs and spas in the [[communes of chile|commune]] of Puc\u00f3n and the surrounding area, including: Palgu\u00edn, Rio Blanco, Huife, Quimey-Co and Los Pozones. The nearby commune of [[Curarrehue, Chile|Curarrehue]] also contains popular spas, including: Menet\u00fae, San Luis, Trancura, Panqui and Ancamil.\n[[File:Araucania Lake District.jpg|350px|thumb|none|Puc\u00f3n is visible in the left center of the image.

In 1964, a lahar destroyed much of the woodlogging town of [[Co\u00f1aripe]]. A 2014 study determined that the international road just east of the [[Puc\u00f3n Airport]] lies in a zone of high danger, as does the road connecting to the west with the town of Villarrica. The airport is in a low danger zone, while most the urbanized area of the city was outside the possible paths for lahars.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Bono Troncoso |first=Laura Andrea del Carmen |date=2014 |title=Modelaci\u00f3n de los lahares del volc\u00e1n Villarrica en el sector de Puc\u00f3n, Regi\u00f3n de La Araucan\u00eda |type= |chapter=Discusiones |publisher=[[Universidad de Chile]] |docket=|language=Spanish |oclc= |chapter-url= |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nAs a commune, Puc\u00f3n is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an [[alcalde]] who is directly elected every four years.

It was a strategically advantageous spot because of its location at entrance of the [[Trancura River|Trancura Valley]], where the Argentinean army had once pursued a group of Mapuches through [[Mamuil Malal Pass]] during the [[Conquest of the Desert]].\n \nThe first hotel in Puc\u00f3n was the Gudenschwager, established in 1923, but it was in 1934 with the establishment of Gran Hotel Puc\u00f3n that tourism became a popular activity in the area.

Due to its striking natural surroundings which include volcanoes, lakes, waterfalls, nature reserves and hot springs, Puc\u00f3n attracts tourism all year round. During the summer, popular tourist activities include [[Hiking in Chile|hiking]], [[rafting]], horseback riding, bird watching, fishing, canopy trails, and canyoning. In winter and spring, it is possible to go skiing or snowboarding on the slopes of Villarrica volcano or visit one of the several thermal baths scattered around the nearby [[Valdivian temperate rain forest]]. These activities are easily arranged from the city itself, which harbours several tourist offices and travel agencies. Despite its relatively small urban area, accommodation infrastructure in Puc\u00f3n is well developed, ranging from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels. Chilean and international cuisine can be found in one of the several city restaurants.

In 1935 he thus decided to create a studio of his own to insure Consolidated's stability. Six surviving small companies ([[Monogram Pictures]], [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Liberty Pictures]], [[Majestic Pictures]], [[Chesterfield Pictures]] and Invincible Pictures) were all in debt to Yates' lab. He prevailed upon these studios to merge under his leadership or else face foreclosure on their outstanding lab bills. Yates' new company, Republic Pictures Corporation, was presented to their producer-owners <ref name=DotM /> as a collaborative enterprise focused on low-budget product.\n\n* The largest of Republic's components was [[Monogram Pictures]], run by producers [[Trem Carr]] and [[W. Ray Johnston]], which specialized in \"B\" films and operated a nationwide distribution system.<ref name=DotM />\n* The most technologically advanced of the studios that now comprised Republic was [[Nat Levine]]'s [[Mascot Pictures Corporation]], which had been making serials almost exclusively since the mid-'20s and had a first-class production facility, the former [[Mack Sennett]] lot in Studio City. Mascot also had just discovered [[Gene Autry]] and signed him to a contract as a singing cowboy star.\n* [[Larry Darmour]]'s [[Majestic Pictures]] had developed an exhibitor following with big-name stars and rented sets giving his humble productions a polished look.\n* Republic took its original \"[[Liberty Bell]]\" logo from [[M.H. Hoffman]]'s [[Liberty Pictures]] (not to be confused with [[Frank Capra]]'s short-lived [[Liberty Films]] that produced his ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', coincidentally now owned by Republic) as well as Hoffman's talents as a low-budet film producer.\n* [[Chesterfield Pictures]] and Invincible Pictures, two sister companies under the same ownership, were skilled in producing low-budget melodramas and mysteries.\n\nAcquiring and integrating these six companies enabled Republic to begin life with an experienced production staff, a company of veteran B-film supporting players and at least one very promising star, a complete distribution system and a functioning and modern studio. In exchange for merging, the principals were promised independence in their productions under the Republic aegis, and higher budgets with which to improve the quality of the films. After he had learned the basics of film production and distribution from his partners, Yates began asserting more and more authority over their film departments, and dissension arose in the ranks. Carr and Johnston left and reactivated Monogram Pictures in 1937;<ref name=DotM /> Darmour resumed independent production for [[Columbia Pictures]]; Levine left and never recovered from the loss of his studio, staff and stars, all of whom now were contracted to Republic and Yates. Meanwhile, Yates installed a staff of new, \"associate\" producers who were loyal to him. Freed of partners, Yates presided over what was now his film studio and acquiring senior production and management staff who served him as employees, not experienced peers with independent ideas and agendas.\n\nRepublic also acquired [[Brunswick Records]] to record its singing cowboys [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]] and hired [[Cy Feuer]] as head of its music department.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feuer|first1=Cy|title=I Got the Show Right Here: The Amazing True Story of How an Obscure Brooklyn Horn Player Became the Last Great Broadway Showman|date=August 1, 2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-55783-658-8|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFMOS1YIHboC&q=Republic+Pictures#v=snippet&q=Republic%20Pictures&f=false|accessdate=November 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1958 annual meeting, Yates announced the end of motion picture production.<ref name=DotM />\n\n== Movie studio ==\n=== Notable Republic films ===\n{{Main|List of Republic Pictures films}}\n\n=== Types of films ===\nIn its early years Republic was itself sometimes labelled a \"[[Poverty Row]]\" company, as its primary products were [[B movies]] and [[serial (film)|serials]]. Republic, however, showed more interest in \u2014 and provided larger budgets to \u2014 these films than many of the larger studios were doing, and certainly more than other independents were able to. The heart of the company was its westerns, and its many western-film leads \u2014 among them [[John Wayne]], [[Gene Autry]], [[Rex Allen]] and [[Roy Rogers]] \u2014 became recognizable stars at Republic. However, by the mid-'40s Yates was producing better-quality pictures, mounting big-budget fare like ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' and ''The Maverick Queen''. Another distinguishing aspect of Republic Pictures was Yates' avoidance of any controversial subject matter (exploitation films being a staple of B movies), adhering to the Breen Office, in contrast to the other \"Poverty Row\" studios, which often dodged the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]].\n\nIn 1946 Republic incorporated animation into its Gene Autry feature film ''Sioux City Sue''. It turned out well enough for the studio to dabble in animated cartoons. After leaving [[Warner Bros.]] in 1946 (reportedly because of angering his peers at the studio's cartoon division for taking credit that was not really his), [[Bob Clampett]] approached Republic and wound up directing a single cartoon, ''It's a Grand Old Nag'', featuring the equine character Charlie Horse. Republic management, however, had second thoughts owing to dwindling profits, and discontinued the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/brewtv/grandoldnag |title=It's a Grand Old Nag |accessdate=October 30, 2009 |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Beck |author2=Amidi, Amid |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721020903/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/brewtv/grandoldnag |archivedate=July 21, 2012 }}</ref> Clampett took his direction credit under the name \"[[Kilroy was here|Kilroy]]\". Republic also made another cartoon series in 1949 (this time without Clampett) called ''Jerky Journeys'', but only four cartoons were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonresearch.com/faqx.html|title=CARTOON RESEARCH FAQ-2|website=www.cartoonresearch.com}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-'40s, Republic films often featured [[Vera Ralston|Vera Hruba Ralston]], a former ice-skater from Czechoslovakia who had won the heart of studio boss Yates, becoming the second Mrs. Yates in 1949. She was originally featured in musicals as Republic's answer to [[Sonja Henie]], but Yates tried to build her up as a dramatic star, casting her in leading roles opposite important male stars. Yates billed her as \"the most beautiful woman in films,\" but her charms were lost on the moviegoing public and exhibitors complained that Republic was making too many Ralston pictures. Years later, [[John Wayne]] admitted that the reason he left Republic in 1952 was the threat of having to make another picture with her. Yates remained Miss Ralston's biggest supporter, and she continued to appear in Republic features until its very last production.\n\nRepublic produced many \"[[hillbilly]]\" rural musicals and comedies featuring Bob Burns, The Weaver Brothers and [[Judy Canova]] that were popular in many rural areas of the United States.<ref>p.161 Harkins, Anthony ''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon\" 2005 Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nBy the mid-late 1940s, the American film industry faced an existential threat, the result of years of wartime stress on costs, the Paramount case, and the rise of television. In 1947, Yates stopped the production of short subjects, reduced the amount of serials, and organised Republic's feature output into four types of films: \"Jubilee\", usually a western shot in seven days for about $50,000; \"Anniversary\", filmed in 14-15 days for $175,000-$200,000; \"Deluxe\", major productions made with a budget of around $500,000; and \"Premiere\", which were usually made by top-rank directors who did not usually work for Republic, such as [[John Ford]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Frank Borzage]], and which could have a budget of $1,000,000 or more.<ref>p.276 Roberts, Randy & Olson, James Stewart ''John Wayne: American'' 1997 University of Nebraska Press</ref> Some of these \"Deluxe\" films were from independent production companies that were picked up for release by Republic.\n\nAlthough Republic made most of its films in black and white, it occasionally produced a higher-budgeted film, such as ''[[The Red Pony (1949 film)|The Red Pony]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' (1952), in [[Technicolor]]. During the late '40s and '50s Yates utilized a low-cost [[Cinecolor]] process called [[Trucolor]] in many of his films, including ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), ''[[The Last Command (1955 film)|The Last Command]]'' (1955), and ''[[Magic Fire]]'' (1956). In 1956 the studio came up with its own [[widescreen]] film process, [[Naturama]], with ''[[The Maverick Queen]]'' being the first film made in that process.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/naturama.htm Naturama \u2013 Republic's New Wide \u2013 Screen Process]. Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-18.</ref>\n\n== Television era ==\nRepublic was one of the first Hollywood studios to offer its film library to television. In 1951 Republic established a subsidiary, '''Hollywood Television Service''', to sell screening rights in its vintage westerns and action thrillers. Many of these films, especially the westerns, were edited to fit in a one-hour television slot.\n\nHollywood Television Service also produced television shows filmed in the same style as Republic's serials, such as ''[[The Adventures of Fu Manchu]]'' (1956). Also, in 1952 the Republic studio lot became the first home of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s series factory, [[Revue Studios|Revue Productions]].\n\nWhile it appeared that Republic was well suited for television series production, it did not have the finances or vision to do so. Yet by the mid-'50s, thanks to its sale of old features and leasing of studio space to MCA, television was the prop supporting Republic. During this period the studio produced ''[[Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe]]''; unsuccessful as a theater release, the 12-part serial was later sold to NBC for television distribution.\n\nTalent agent MCA exerted influence at the studio, bringing in some high-paid clients for occasional features, and it was rumored at various times that either MCA or deposed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] head [[Louis B. Mayer]] would buy the studio outright.\n\nAs the demand and market for motion pictures declined with the increasing popularity of television, Republic began to cut back on its films, slowing production from 40 features annually in the early '50s to 18 in 1957 (on 1956--the year the company had recorded a profit of $919,000--it temporarily ceased production of features.<ref>Option Reported Given For President's Stock In Republic Pictures: H.J.

In 1935 he thus decided to create a studio of his own to insure Consolidated's stability. Six surviving small companies ([[Monogram Pictures]], [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Liberty Pictures]], [[Majestic Pictures]], [[Chesterfield Pictures]] and Invincible Pictures) were all in debt to Yates' lab. He prevailed upon these studios to merge under his leadership or else face foreclosure on their outstanding lab bills. Yates' new company, Republic Pictures Corporation, was presented to their producer-owners <ref name=DotM /> as a collaborative enterprise focused on low-budget product.\n\n* The largest of Republic's components was [[Monogram Pictures]], run by producers [[Trem Carr]] and [[W. Ray Johnston]], which specialized in \"B\" films and operated a nationwide distribution system.<ref name=DotM />\n* The most technologically advanced of the studios that now comprised Republic was [[Nat Levine]]'s [[Mascot Pictures Corporation]], which had been making serials almost exclusively since the mid-'20s and had a first-class production facility, the former [[Mack Sennett]] lot in Studio City. Mascot also had just discovered [[Gene Autry]] and signed him to a contract as a singing cowboy star.\n* [[Larry Darmour]]'s [[Majestic Pictures]] had developed an exhibitor following with big-name stars and rented sets giving his humble productions a polished look.\n* Republic took its original \"[[Liberty Bell]]\" logo from [[M.H. Hoffman]]'s [[Liberty Pictures]] (not to be confused with [[Frank Capra]]'s short-lived [[Liberty Films]] that produced his ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', coincidentally now owned by Republic) as well as Hoffman's talents as a low-budget film producer.\n* [[Chesterfield Pictures]] and Invincible Pictures, two sister companies under the same ownership, were skilled in producing low-budget melodramas and mysteries.\n\nAcquiring and integrating these six companies enabled Republic to begin life with an experienced production staff, a company of veteran B-film supporting players and at least one very promising star, a complete distribution system and a functioning and modern studio. In exchange for merging, the principals were promised independence in their productions under the Republic aegis, and higher budgets with which to improve the quality of the films. After he had learned the basics of film production and distribution from his partners, Yates began asserting more and more authority over their film departments, and dissension arose in the ranks. Carr and Johnston left and reactivated Monogram Pictures in 1937;<ref name=DotM /> Darmour resumed independent production for [[Columbia Pictures]]; Levine left and never recovered from the loss of his studio, staff and stars, all of whom now were contracted to Republic and Yates. Meanwhile, Yates installed a staff of new, \"associate\" producers who were loyal to him. Freed of partners, Yates presided over what was now his film studio and acquiring senior production and management staff who served him as employees, not experienced peers with independent ideas and agendas.\n\nRepublic also acquired [[Brunswick Records]] to record its singing cowboys [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]] and hired [[Cy Feuer]] as head of its music department.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feuer|first1=Cy|title=I Got the Show Right Here: The Amazing True Story of How an Obscure Brooklyn Horn Player Became the Last Great Broadway Showman|date=August 1, 2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-55783-658-8|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFMOS1YIHboC&q=Republic+Pictures#v=snippet&q=Republic%20Pictures&f=false|accessdate=November 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1958 annual meeting, Yates announced the end of motion picture production.<ref name=DotM />\n\n== Movie studio ==\n=== Notable Republic films ===\n{{Main|List of Republic Pictures films}}\n\n=== Types of films ===\nIn its early years Republic was itself sometimes labelled a \"[[Poverty Row]]\" company, as its primary products were [[B movies]] and [[serial (film)|serials]]. Republic, however, showed more interest in \u2014 and provided larger budgets to \u2014 these films than many of the larger studios were doing, and certainly more than other independents were able to. The heart of the company was its westerns, and its many western-film leads \u2014 among them [[John Wayne]], [[Gene Autry]], [[Rex Allen]] and [[Roy Rogers]] \u2014 became recognizable stars at Republic. However, by the mid-'40s Yates was producing better-quality pictures, mounting big-budget fare like ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' and ''The Maverick Queen''. Another distinguishing aspect of Republic Pictures was Yates' avoidance of any controversial subject matter (exploitation films being a staple of B movies), adhering to the Breen Office, in contrast to the other \"Poverty Row\" studios, which often dodged the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]].\n\nIn 1946 Republic incorporated animation into its Gene Autry feature film ''Sioux City Sue''. It turned out well enough for the studio to dabble in animated cartoons. After leaving [[Warner Bros.]] in 1946 (reportedly because of angering his peers at the studio's cartoon division for taking credit that was not really his), [[Bob Clampett]] approached Republic and wound up directing a single cartoon, ''It's a Grand Old Nag'', featuring the equine character Charlie Horse. Republic management, however, had second thoughts owing to dwindling profits, and discontinued the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/brewtv/grandoldnag |title=It's a Grand Old Nag |accessdate=October 30, 2009 |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Beck |author2=Amidi, Amid |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721020903/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/brewtv/grandoldnag |archivedate=July 21, 2012 }}</ref> Clampett took his direction credit under the name \"[[Kilroy was here|Kilroy]]\". Republic also made another cartoon series in 1949 (this time without Clampett) called ''Jerky Journeys'', but only four cartoons were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonresearch.com/faqx.html|title=CARTOON RESEARCH FAQ-2|website=www.cartoonresearch.com}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-'40s, Republic films often featured [[Vera Ralston|Vera Hruba Ralston]], a former ice-skater from Czechoslovakia who had won the heart of studio boss Yates, becoming the second Mrs. Yates in 1949.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} She was originally featured in musicals as Republic's answer to [[Sonja Henie]], but Yates tried to build her up as a dramatic star, casting her in leading roles opposite important male stars. Yates billed her as \"the most beautiful woman in films,\" but her charms were lost on the moviegoing public and exhibitors complained that Republic was making too many Ralston pictures. Years later, [[John Wayne]] admitted that the reason he left Republic in 1952 was the threat of having to make another picture with her. Yates remained Miss Ralston's biggest supporter, and she continued to appear in Republic features until its very last production.\n\nRepublic produced many \"[[hillbilly]]\" rural musicals and comedies featuring Bob Burns, The Weaver Brothers and [[Judy Canova]] that were popular in many rural areas of the United States.<ref>p.161 Harkins, Anthony ''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon\" 2005 Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nBy the mid-late 1940s, the American film industry faced an existential threat, the result of years of wartime stress on costs and the post-war exchange and trade restrictions enacted by the nations of Continental Europe (practically closing off the market to smaller studios such as Republic), the Paramount case (even though Republic never owned more than a handful of theaters), and the rise of television. In 1947, Yates stopped the production of short subjects, reduced the amount of serials, and organised Republic's feature output into four types of films: \"Jubilee\", usually a western shot in seven days for about $50,000; \"Anniversary\", filmed in 14-15 days for $175,000-$200,000; \"Deluxe\", major productions made with a budget of around $500,000; and \"Premiere\", which were usually made by top-rank directors who did not usually work for Republic, such as [[John Ford]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Frank Borzage]], and which could have a budget of $1,000,000 or more.<ref>p.276 Roberts, Randy & Olson, James Stewart ''John Wayne: American'' 1997 University of Nebraska Press</ref> Some of these \"Deluxe\" films were from independent production companies that were picked up for release by Republic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAlthough Republic made most of its films in black and white, it occasionally produced a higher-budgeted film, such as ''[[The Red Pony (1949 film)|The Red Pony]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' (1952), in [[Technicolor]]. During the late '40s and '50s Yates utilized a low-cost [[Cinecolor]] process called [[Trucolor]] in many of his films, including ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), ''[[The Last Command (1955 film)|The Last Command]]'' (1955), and ''[[Magic Fire]]'' (1956). In 1956 the studio came up with its own [[widescreen]] film process, [[Naturama]], with ''[[The Maverick Queen]]'' being the first film made in that process.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/naturama.htm Naturama \u2013 Republic's New Wide \u2013 Screen Process]. Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-18.</ref>\n\n== Television era ==\nRepublic was one of the first Hollywood studios to offer its film library to television. In 1951 Republic established a subsidiary, '''Hollywood Television Service''', to sell screening rights in its vintage westerns and action thrillers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Many of these films, especially the westerns, were edited to fit in a one-hour television slot.\n\nHollywood Television Service also produced television shows filmed in the same style as Republic's serials, such as ''[[The Adventures of Fu Manchu]]'' (1956). Also, in 1952 the Republic studio lot became the first home of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s series factory, [[Revue Studios|Revue Productions]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nWhile it appeared that Republic was well suited for television series production, it did not have the finances or vision to do so. Yet by the mid-'50s, thanks to its sale of old features and leasing of studio space to MCA, television was the prop supporting Republic. During this period the studio produced ''[[Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe]]''; unsuccessful as a theater release, the 12-part serial was later sold to NBC for television distribution.\n\nTalent agent MCA exerted influence at the studio, bringing in some high-paid clients for occasional features, and it was rumored at various times that either MCA or deposed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] head [[Louis B. Mayer]] would buy the studio outright.\n\nAs the demand and market for motion pictures declined with the increasing popularity of television, Republic began to cut back on its films, slowing production from 40 features annually in the early '50s to 18 in 1957 (on 1956--the year the company had recorded a profit of $919,000--it temporarily ceased production of features.<ref>Option Reported Given For President's Stock In Republic Pictures: H.J.

At the same time, subsidiary NTA Home Entertainment was renamed '''Republic Pictures Home Video''' and began remarketing the original Republic's film library.\n\nIn 1993 this new Republic won a landmark legal decision reactivating the copyright on [[Frank Capra]]'s 1946 [[RKO]] film ''It's a Wonderful Life'' (under NTA, it had already acquired the film's negative, music score and the story on which it was based, \"[[The Greatest Gift (story)|The Greatest Gift]]\").\n\nOn April 27, 1994, [[Spelling Television|Spelling Entertainment]], headed by [[Aaron Spelling]] and controlled by [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]], acquired the Republic Pictures library; soon after, Blockbuster's established home video unit, [[Worldvision Enterprises|Worldvision Home Video]], merged with Republic's and took the latter's name.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TwgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82&dq=worldvision+enterprises+republic#v=onepage&q=worldvision%20enterprises%20republic&f=false|title=Billboard|last=Lichtman|first=Irv|date=1994-05-28|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|isbn=|location=|pages=82|language=en}}</ref> Later that year, Blockbuster merged with [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]].\n\nIn 1996, Republic shut down its film production unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/artisan-to-distrib-republic-1117480224/|title=Artisan to distrib Republic|last=Carver|first=Benedict|date=1998-09-09|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref> In September 1997, Republic's video rental operations were taken over by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Entertainment]]; its sell-through operations remained.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BwoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=Republic+Pictures+Paramount+rental#v=onepage&q=Republic%20Pictures%20Paramount%20rental&f=false|title=Billboard|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Eileen|date=1997-09-06|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|isbn=|location=|pages=96|language=en}}</ref> In September 1998, Spelling licensed the American and Canadian video rights to its library to [[Artisan Entertainment]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GgoEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Nielsen Business Media|date=1998-09-26|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|via=}}</ref> while the library itself continued to be released under the Republic name and logo. By the end of the decade Viacom bought the portion of Spelling it did not own previously; thus, Republic became a wholly owned division of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. Artisan (later sold to [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]) continued to use the Republic name, logo and library under license from Paramount. Republic Pictures' holdings consist of a catalog of 3,000 films and TV series, including the original Republic library (except for the Roy Rogers and Gene Autry catalogs, owned by their respective estates) and inherited properties from NTA and Aaron Spelling.\n\nIn 2012 library holder Richard Feiner & Co. sued Paramount for the unauthorized exploitation of 17 films from the '40s and '50s originally released by [[Warner Bros.]] Feiner sold Republic Pictures the \"rights, and interest of every kind, nature, and description throughout the Universe\" to the films in 1986, but retained the license to exploit the films in major U.S. markets (New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, etc.). Plaintiff claimed that the films aired on cable several times without their knowledge. The case was later settled, with Feiner now sharing in the royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/innyco20120405321|title=RICHARD FEINER v.

Joyce is best known for ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Other well-known works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914), and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.\n\nJoyce was born in [[Dublin]] into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run [[O'Connell School]] before excelling at the Jesuit schools [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] and [[Belvedere College|Belvedere]], despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances. He went on to attend [[University College Dublin]].\n\nIn 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) [[Nora Barnacle]]. They lived in [[Trieste]], [[Paris]], and [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. ''Ulysses'' in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of ''Ulysses'', he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"<ref>Ellman, p. 505, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House'' (London, n.d.), pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:James Joyce birth and baptismal certificate.jpg|thumb|Joyce's birth and baptismal certificate]]\nOn 2 February 1882, Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/what-does-joyce-mean-to-you-1.678911|title=What does Joyce mean to you?|first=Rosita|last=Bol|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> Joyce's father was [[John Stanislaus Joyce]] and his mother was Mary Jane \"May\" Murray. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings; two died of [[typhoid]]. James was baptised according to the Rites of the [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic Church]] in the nearby St Joseph's Church in [[Terenure]] on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O'Mulloy. Joyce's godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.\n\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce's family came from [[Fermoy]] in [[County Cork]], and had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork Alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City.

Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong [[cynophobia]]. He suffered from [[astraphobia]]; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God's wrath.<ref>\"'Why are you so afraid of thunder?' asked [Arthur] Power, 'your children don't mind it.' 'Ah,' said Joyce contemptuously, 'they have no religion.'

His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Home Rule Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberal Party]] and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce.<ref>In Search of Ireland's Heroes: [[Carmel McCaffrey]] pp. 279\u201386</ref> The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the [[Vatican Library]]. In November, John Joyce was entered in ''[[Stubbs' Gazette]]'' (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 32\u201334.</ref>\n\nJoyce had begun his education at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school near [[Clane]], County Kildare, in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the [[O'Connell School|Christian Brothers O'Connell School]] on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest called [[John Conmee]] who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere.<ref>James Joyce: Richard Ellmann 1982 pp. 54\u201355</ref> In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] by his peers at Belvedere.<ref>[http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/joyce_chronology.html Themodernworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622062917/http://www.themodernword.com/Joyce/joyce_chronology.html |date=22 June 2011 }}</ref> The philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 60, 190, 340, 342; Cf.

He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' was published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]''; it was his first publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, [[Tom Kettle]], [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]] and [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by [[Arthur Griffith]] in his newspaper, ''[[United Irishman]]'', in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce.<ref>Jordan, Anthony, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0220/1224312050318.html \"An Irishman's Diary\"], ''Irish Times'', 20 February 2012</ref><ref>Arthur Griffith with James Joyce & WB Yeats \u2013 Liberating Ireland by Anthony J.

Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin. But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather.<ref>Richard Ellmann: James Joyce (1959) pp. 117\u201318</ref> He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill-afford and reading late in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]].

He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called ''Stephen Hero''. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''. The unfinished ''Stephen Hero'' was published after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=28 |title=Joyce \u2013 Other works |publisher=The James Joyce Centre |accessdate=22 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624115127/http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=28 |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1904, he met [[Nora Barnacle]], a young woman from [[Galway|Galway city]] who was working as a chambermaid.

It later became evident that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to [[Trieste]], which was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in [[Pula|Pola]], then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of [[Croatia]]). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians\u2014having discovered an espionage ring in the city\u2014expelled all [[Alien (law)|aliens]]. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there.

Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, to join him in Trieste, and secured a teaching position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings.<ref>According to Ellmann, Stanislaus allowed Joyce to collect his pay, \"to simplify matters\" (p. 213).</ref> Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in Trieste, arguing about Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.<ref>The worst of the conflicts were during July 1910 (Ellmann (1982), pp. 311\u201313).</ref>\n\nJoyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank.

He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the [[Volta Cinematograph]], which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 300\u201303, 308, 311.</ref> Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying the [[Czech people|Czech]] bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 384\u201385.</ref>\n\nJoyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of ''Dubliners''. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem \"Gas from a Burner\", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer [[William Butler Yeats]].\n\nOne of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym [[Italo Svevo]]. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] in ''Ulysses'' came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), p. 272.</ref> While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 268, 417.</ref>\n\nJoyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema [[Business magnate|magnate]] in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in [[Dublin]]. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.\n\nIn 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the [[World War I|Great War]], Joyce moved to Z\u00fcrich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.<ref>Ellman (1982), p. 386.</ref>\n\nDuring this period Joyce took an active interest in [[socialism]].<ref name=\"Sultan\">{{cite book |last1=Sultan |first1=Stanley |title=Eliot, Joyce, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/nley00stan |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nley00stan/page/208 208\u2013209]}}</ref> He had attended socialist meetings when he was still in Dublin and 1905, while in Trieste, he described his politics as \"those of a socialist artist.\"<ref name=\"Sultan\" /> Although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to the \"endless internecine warfare\" he observed in socialist organizations, many Joyce scholars such as [[Richard Ellmann]], Dominic Manganiello, [[Robert Scholes]], and George J.

A further grant from [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an [[eyepatch]].

In their literary magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', the Jolases published serially various sections of ''Finnegans Wake'' under the title ''Work in Progress''. Joyce returned to Z\u00fcrich in late 1940, fleeing the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]].

Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:\n\n<blockquote>My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity\u2014home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. ... Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature.

The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in ''Dubliners'' later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel ''Ulysses''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |title=Notes on James Joyce's Ulysses |author=Michael Groden |publisher=[[The University of Western Ontario]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101010343/http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |archivedate=1 November 2005 |df= }}</ref> The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.\n\n===''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''===\n{{Main|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man}}\n''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel ''[[Stephen Hero]]''. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A ''[[K\u00fcnstlerroman]]'', ''Portrait'' is a heavily autobiographical<ref>MacBride, p. 14.</ref> [[bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.<ref>Deming, p. 749.</ref>\n\n===''Exiles'' and poetry===\n{{Main|Pomes Penyeach|Chamber Music (poetry collection)}}\n\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.\n\nJoyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside \"The Holy Office\" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic Revival]]. His first full-length poetry collection, ''[[Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Chamber Music]]'' (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot), consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include \"Gas from a Burner\" (1912), ''Pomes Penyeach'' (1927) and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in ''Collected Poems'' (1936).\n\n===''Ulysses''===\n{{Main|Ulysses (novel)}}\n{{See also|Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review}}\n\n[[File:Order form for ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Page saying 'ULYSSES by JAMES JOYCE will be published in the Autumn of 1921 by \"SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY\" \u2013 SYLVIA BEACH \u2013 8, RUE DUPUYTREN, PARIS \u2013 VIe'|Announcement of the initial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.]]\nAs he was completing work on ''Dubliners'' in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).\n\nThanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by [[Margaret C. Anderson]] and [[Jane Heap]], with the intermittent financial backing of [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature.\n\nThis provoked the first accusations of obscenity with which the book would be identified for so long. Its amorphous structure with frank, intimate musings (\u2018stream of consciousness\u2019) were seen to offend both church and state. The publication encountered problems with [[United States Postal Service|New York Postal Authorities]]; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing [[obscenity]] in February 1921.<ref>[[Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review]]; Gillers, pp. 251\u201362.</ref> Although the conviction was based on the \"Nausica\u00e4\" episode of ''Ulysses'', ''The Little Review'' had fuelled the fires of controversy with [[dada]] poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]'s defence of ''Ulysses'' in an essay \"The Modest Woman.\"<ref>[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 253.</ref> Joyce's novel was not published in the United States until 1934.<ref>The fear of prosecution for publication ended after the court decision of ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'', 5 F.Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1933). Ellman, pp. 666\u201367.</ref>\n\nPartly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by [[Sylvia Beach]] from her well-known [[Rive Gauche]] bookshop, ''[[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]]''. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of \"bootleg\" versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.\n\nWith the appearance of both ''Ulysses'' and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'', 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In ''Ulysses'', Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters.<ref>Examined at length in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Ulysses. A Facsimile of the Manuscript.'' Bloomfield Hills/Columbia: Bruccoli Clark, 1980.</ref> The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the [[Odyssey]] of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model.<ref>Adams, David. ''Colonial Odysseys: Empire and Epic in the Modernist Novel''. Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 84.</ref> In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of ''[[Thom's Directory]]''\u2014a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.\n\nThe book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8&nbsp;a.m. and ending sometime after 2&nbsp;a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature.<ref>Sherry, Vincent B. ''James Joyce: Ulysses''. Cambridge University\nPress, 2004, p. 102.</ref> Other contributions include the use of [[classical mythology]] as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer.<ref>Dettmar, Kevin J.H. ''Rereading the New: A Backward Glance at Modernism''. University of Michigan Press, 1992, p. 285.</ref> Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when [[Stuart Gilbert]] published his critical work on ''Ulysses'' in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.<ref name=\"Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen\">Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen</ref>\n\n===''Finnegans Wake''===\n{{Main|Finnegans Wake}}\nHaving completed work on ''Ulysses'', Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year.<ref>Bulson, Eric. ''The Cambridge Introduction to James Joyce''. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 14.</ref> On 10 March 1923 he informed his patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver: \"Yesterday I wrote two pages\u2014the first I have since the final ''Yes'' of ''Ulysses''. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of [[wikt:foolscap|foolscap]] so that I could read them. ''Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio'', the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'\"<ref>Joyce, James. ''Ulysses: The 1922 Text''. Oxford University Press, 1998, p. xlvii.</ref> Thus was born a text that became known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''Finnegans Wake''.\n\nBy 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''transition''. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 591\u201392.</ref>\n\nReaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 577\u201385.</ref> To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author [[Hervey M. Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]], who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'', Cleckley refers to ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as \"a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.\"<ref>Cleckley, Hervey (1982). The Mask of Sanity. Revised Edition. Mosby Medical Library. {{ISBN|0-452-25341-1}}.</ref>\n\nJoyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''Finnegans Wake'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the ''Wake'' of ''Ulysses'' as his \"usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 179. 26\u201327.</ref> to the ''Wake'' itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.\n\nMuch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.<ref>Gluck, p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the \"characters\". Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. ''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the\". In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Shockley |editor1-first=Alan W. |editor1-last=Friedman |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Rossman |title=De-Familiarizing Readings: Essays from the Austin Joyce Conference |publisher=Editions Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-420-2570-7 |series=European Joyce Studies |volume=18 |year=2009 |page=104 |chapter=Playing the Square Circle: Musical Form and Polyphony in the ''Wake'' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW96fbBNRYsC&pg=PA104 }}</ref> Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the ''Wake'' would suffer from \"ideal insomnia\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 120. 9\u201316.</ref> and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Joyce oconnell dublin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Bronze statue of Joyce standing in a coat and broadbrimmed hat.

He contributed to the [[Modernism|modernist]] [[avant-garde]] and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Other well-known works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914), and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.\n\nJoyce was born in [[Dublin]] into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run [[O'Connell School]] before excelling at the Jesuit schools [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] and [[Belvedere College|Belvedere]], despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances. He went on to attend [[University College Dublin]].\n\nIn 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) [[Nora Barnacle]]. They lived in [[Trieste]], [[Paris]], and [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. ''Ulysses'' in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of ''Ulysses'', he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"<ref>Ellman, p. 505, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House'' (London, n.d.), pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:James Joyce birth and baptismal certificate.jpg|thumb|Joyce's birth and baptismal certificate]]\nOn 2 February 1882, Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/what-does-joyce-mean-to-you-1.678911|title=What does Joyce mean to you?|first=Rosita|last=Bol|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> Joyce's father was [[John Stanislaus Joyce]] and his mother was Mary Jane \"May\" Murray. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings; two died of [[typhoid]]. James was baptised according to the Rites of the [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic Church]] in the nearby St Joseph's Church in [[Terenure]] on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O'Mulloy. Joyce's godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.\n\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce's family came from [[Fermoy]] in [[County Cork]], and had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork Alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City.

Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong [[cynophobia]]. He suffered from [[astraphobia]]; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God's wrath.<ref>\"'Why are you so afraid of thunder?' asked [Arthur] Power, 'your children don't mind it.' 'Ah,' said Joyce contemptuously, 'they have no religion.'

His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Home Rule Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberal Party]] and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce.<ref>In Search of Ireland's Heroes: [[Carmel McCaffrey]] pp. 279\u201386</ref> The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the [[Vatican Library]]. In November, John Joyce was entered in ''[[Stubbs' Gazette]]'' (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 32\u201334.</ref>\n\nJoyce had begun his education at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school near [[Clane]], County Kildare, in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the [[O'Connell School|Christian Brothers O'Connell School]] on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest called [[John Conmee]] who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere.<ref>James Joyce: Richard Ellmann 1982 pp. 54\u201355</ref> In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] by his peers at Belvedere.<ref>[http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/joyce_chronology.html Themodernworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622062917/http://www.themodernword.com/Joyce/joyce_chronology.html |date=22 June 2011 }}</ref> The philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 60, 190, 340, 342; Cf.

He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' was published in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]''; it was his first publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, [[Tom Kettle]], [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]] and [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by [[Arthur Griffith]] in his newspaper, ''[[United Irishman]]'', in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce.<ref>Jordan, Anthony, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0220/1224312050318.html \"An Irishman's Diary\"], ''Irish Times'', 20 February 2012</ref><ref>Arthur Griffith with James Joyce & WB Yeats \u2013 Liberating Ireland by Anthony J.

Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin. But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather.<ref>Richard Ellmann: James Joyce (1959) pp. 117\u201318</ref> He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill-afford and reading late in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]].

He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called ''Stephen Hero''. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''.

It later became evident that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to [[Trieste]], which was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in [[Pula|Pola]], then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of [[Croatia]]). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians\u2014having discovered an espionage ring in the city\u2014expelled all [[Alien (law)|aliens]]. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.<ref name=\"mccourt\">McCourt 2001.</ref><ref>[https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/james-joyce-in-trieste/ \"James Joyce in Trieste\", Radio Netherlands Archives, January 1, 2000]</ref>\n\nLater that year Nora gave birth to their first child, George (known as Giorgio). Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, to join him in Trieste, and secured a teaching position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings.<ref>According to Ellmann, Stanislaus allowed Joyce to collect his pay, \"to simplify matters\" (p. 213).</ref> Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in Trieste, arguing about Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.<ref>The worst of the conflicts were during July 1910 (Ellmann (1982), pp. 311\u201313).</ref>\n\nJoyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank.

He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the [[Volta Cinematograph]], which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 300\u201303, 308, 311.</ref> Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying the [[Czech people|Czech]] bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 384\u201385.</ref>\n\nJoyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of ''Dubliners''. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem \"Gas from a Burner\", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer [[William Butler Yeats]].\n\nOne of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym [[Italo Svevo]]. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] in ''Ulysses'' came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), p. 272.</ref> While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 268, 417.</ref>\n\nJoyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema [[Business magnate|magnate]] in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in [[Dublin]]. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.\n\nIn 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the [[World War I|Great War]], Joyce moved to Z\u00fcrich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.<ref>Ellman (1982), p. 386.</ref>\n\nDuring this period Joyce took an active interest in [[socialism]].<ref name=\"Sultan\">{{cite book |last1=Sultan |first1=Stanley |title=Eliot, Joyce, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/nley00stan |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nley00stan/page/208 208\u2013209]}}</ref> He had attended socialist meetings when he was still in Dublin and 1905, while in Trieste, he described his politics as \"those of a socialist artist.\"<ref name=\"Sultan\" /> Although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to the \"endless internecine warfare\" he observed in socialist organizations, many Joyce scholars such as [[Richard Ellmann]], Dominic Manganiello, [[Robert Scholes]], and George J.

Portrait by [[Patrick Tuohy]].]]\n\nJoyce set himself to finishing ''Ulysses'' in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an [[eyepatch]]. He was treated by Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929.<ref>Ellmann (1982) pp. 566\u201374.</ref> Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. Lucia was analysed by [[Carl Jung]] at the time, who after reading ''Ulysses'' is said to have concluded that her father had schizophrenia.<ref>Shloss, p. 278.</ref> Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.<ref>Pepper, Tara</ref><ref>Shloss p. 297.</ref><ref>The literary executor of the Joyce estate, [[Stephen J.

Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's constant financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', the Jolases published serially various sections of ''Finnegans Wake'' under the title ''Work in Progress''. Joyce returned to Z\u00fcrich in late 1940, fleeing the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]].

Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:\n\n<blockquote>My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity\u2014home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. ... Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature.

The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in ''Dubliners'' later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel ''Ulysses''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |title=Notes on James Joyce's Ulysses |author=Michael Groden |publisher=[[The University of Western Ontario]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101010343/http://publish.uwo.ca/~mgroden/notes/charsfromdub.html |archivedate=1 November 2005 |df= }}</ref> The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.\n\n===''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''===\n{{Main|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man}}\n''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel ''[[Stephen Hero]]''. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A ''[[K\u00fcnstlerroman]]'', ''Portrait'' is a heavily autobiographical<ref>MacBride, p. 14.</ref> [[bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.<ref>Deming, p. 749.</ref>\n\n===''Exiles'' and poetry===\n{{Main|Pomes Penyeach|Chamber Music (poetry collection)}}\n\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.\n\nJoyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside \"The Holy Office\" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic Revival]]. His first full-length poetry collection, ''[[Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Chamber Music]]'' (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot), consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include \"Gas from a Burner\" (1912), ''Pomes Penyeach'' (1927) and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in ''Collected Poems'' (1936).\n\n===''Ulysses''===\n{{Main|Ulysses (novel)}}\n{{See also|Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review}}\n\n[[File:Order form for ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Page saying 'ULYSSES by JAMES JOYCE will be published in the Autumn of 1921 by \"SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY\" \u2013 SYLVIA BEACH \u2013 8, RUE DUPUYTREN, PARIS \u2013 VIe'|Announcement of the initial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.]]\nAs he was completing work on ''Dubliners'' in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).\n\nThanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by [[Margaret C. Anderson]] and [[Jane Heap]], with the intermittent financial backing of [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature.\n\nThis provoked the first accusations of obscenity with which the book would be identified for so long. Its amorphous structure with frank, intimate musings (\u2018stream of consciousness\u2019) were seen to offend both church and state. The publication encountered problems with [[United States Postal Service|New York Postal Authorities]]; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing [[obscenity]] in February 1921.<ref>[[Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review]]; Gillers, pp. 251\u201362.</ref> Although the conviction was based on the \"Nausica\u00e4\" episode of ''Ulysses'', ''The Little Review'' had fuelled the fires of controversy with [[dada]] poet [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]'s defence of ''Ulysses'' in an essay \"The Modest Woman.\"<ref>[[Irene Gammel|Gammel, Irene]]. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 253.</ref> Joyce's novel was not published in the United States until 1934.<ref>The fear of prosecution for publication ended after the court decision of ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'', 5 F.Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1933). Ellman, pp. 666\u201367.</ref>\n\nPartly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by [[Sylvia Beach]] from her well-known [[Rive Gauche]] bookshop, ''[[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]]''. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of \"bootleg\" versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.\n\nWith the appearance of both ''Ulysses'' and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'', 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In ''Ulysses'', Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters.<ref>Examined at length in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Ulysses. A Facsimile of the Manuscript.'' Bloomfield Hills/Columbia: Bruccoli Clark, 1980.</ref> The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the [[Odyssey]] of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model.<ref>Adams, David. ''Colonial Odysseys: Empire and Epic in the Modernist Novel''. Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 84.</ref> In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of ''[[Thom's Directory]]''\u2014a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.\n\nThe book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8&nbsp;a.m. and ending sometime after 2&nbsp;a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature.<ref>Sherry, Vincent B. ''James Joyce: Ulysses''. Cambridge University\nPress, 2004, p. 102.</ref> Other contributions include the use of [[classical mythology]] as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer.<ref>Dettmar, Kevin J.H. ''Rereading the New: A Backward Glance at Modernism''. University of Michigan Press, 1992, p. 285.</ref> Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when [[Stuart Gilbert]] published his critical work on ''Ulysses'' in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.<ref name=\"Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen\">Ulysses Unbound: Terence Killeen</ref>\n\n===''Finnegans Wake''===\n{{Main|Finnegans Wake}}\nHaving completed work on ''Ulysses'', Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year.<ref>Bulson, Eric. ''The Cambridge Introduction to James Joyce''. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 14.</ref> On 10 March 1923 he informed his patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver: \"Yesterday I wrote two pages\u2014the first I have since the final ''Yes'' of ''Ulysses''. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of [[wikt:foolscap|foolscap]] so that I could read them. ''Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio'', the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'\"<ref>Joyce, James. ''Ulysses: The 1922 Text''. Oxford University Press, 1998, p. xlvii.</ref> Thus was born a text that became known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''Finnegans Wake''.\n\nBy 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''transition''. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 591\u201392.</ref>\n\nReaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce.<ref>Ellmann (1982), pp. 577\u201385.</ref> To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author [[Hervey M. Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]], who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'', Cleckley refers to ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as \"a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.\"<ref>Cleckley, Hervey (1982). The Mask of Sanity. Revised Edition. Mosby Medical Library. {{ISBN|0-452-25341-1}}.</ref>\n\nJoyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''Finnegans Wake'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the ''Wake'' of ''Ulysses'' as his \"usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 179. 26\u201327.</ref> to the ''Wake'' itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.\n\nMuch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.<ref>Gluck, p. 27.</ref>\n\nThe view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the \"characters\". Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. ''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the\". In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Shockley |editor1-first=Alan W. |editor1-last=Friedman |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Rossman |title=De-Familiarizing Readings: Essays from the Austin Joyce Conference |publisher=Editions Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-420-2570-7 |series=European Joyce Studies |volume=18 |year=2009 |page=104 |chapter=Playing the Square Circle: Musical Form and Polyphony in the ''Wake'' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW96fbBNRYsC&pg=PA104 }}</ref> Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the ''Wake'' would suffer from \"ideal insomnia\"<ref>''Finnegans Wake'', 120. 9\u201316.</ref> and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Joyce oconnell dublin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Bronze statue of Joyce standing in a coat and broadbrimmed hat.
